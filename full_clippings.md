3. Russian biologists aimed to understand life by integrating it into ecological communities and planetary processes. Meanwhile, in the West, biology developed in a strongly reductionist direction, the aim being to understand life by reducing it to genes and molecules. Reductionist biology was enormously successful and came to dominate the thinking of Western biologists.

The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society, in 1950.4 Before modern electronic computers existed, these books predicted with some degree of accuracy the economic and political effects of computer technology on human societies. “We were here,” he wrote, in the presence of another social potentiality of unheard-of importance for good and for evil.… It gives the human race a new and most effective collection of mechanical slaves to perform its labor.… However, any labor that accepts the conditions of competition with slave labor accepts the conditions of slave labor, and is essentially slave labor.… The answer, of course, is to have a society based on human values other than buying or selling.

17. Littlewood was a famous mathematician who was teaching at Cambridge University when I was a student. Being a professional mathematician, he defined miracles precisely before stating his law about them. He defined a miracle as an event that has special significance when it occurs, but occurs with a probability of one in a million. This definition agrees with our commonsense understanding of the word “miracle.” Littlewood’s law of miracles states that in the course of any normal person’s life, miracles happen at a rate of roughly one per month.

4. In 1983, Athanasious Koukopoulos, director of a mood disorders clinic in Rome, said that he and his colleagues were observing the same thing in their Italian patients. “The general impression of clinicians today is that the course of recurrences of manic-depressive illness has substantially changed in the last 20 years,” he wrote. “The recurrences of many patients have become more frequent. One sees more manias and hypomanias … more rapid cyclers, and more chronic depressions.” Whereas in the pre-drug era rapid cyclers were unknown, 16 percent of Koukopoulos’s manic-depressive patients were now in this predicament, and they were suffering an astonishing 6.5 mood episodes

4. Much of our modern, structured, world has been harming us with top-down policies and contraptions (dubbed “Soviet-Harvard delusions” in the book) which do precisely this: an insult to the antifragility of systems.

   - Location: 1231-1232
   - Page: 81

8. But with complex systems, interdependencies are severe. You need to think in terms of ecology: if you remove a specific animal you disrupt a food chain: its predators will starve and its prey will grow unchecked, causing complications and series of cascading side effects.

16. Switzerland: it is perhaps the most successful country in history, yet it has traditionally had a very low level of university education compared to the rest of the rich nations. Its system, even in banking during my days, was based on apprenticeship models, nearly vocational rather than the theoretical ones. In other words, on techne (crafts and know how), not episteme (book knowledge, know what).
   - Location: 1827-1830
   - Page: 120

17. A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms to its staff of analysts that butchers love turkeys “with increased statistical confidence.” The butcher will keep feeding the turkey until a few days before Thanksgiving. Then comes that day when it is really not a very good idea to be a turkey. So with the butcher surprising it, the turkey will have a revision of belief—right when its confidence in the statement that the butcher loves turkeys is maximal and “it is very quiet” and soothingly predictable in the life of the turkey.

21. There is an element of deceit associated with interventionism, accelerating in a professionalized society. It’s much easier to sell “Look what I did for you” than “Look what I avoided for you.” Of course a bonus system based on “performance” exacerbates the problem. I’ve looked in history for heroes who became heroes for what they did not do, but it is hard to observe nonaction; I could not easily find any. The doctor who refrains from operating on a back (a very expensive surgery), instead giving it a chance to heal itself, will not be rewarded and judged as favorably as the doctor who makes the surgery look indispensable, then brings relief to the patient while exposing him to operating risks, while accruing great financial rewards to himself. The latter will be driving the pink Rolls-Royce.

25. If you put 90 percent of your funds in boring cash (assuming you are protected from inflation) or something called a “numeraire repository of value,” and 10 percent in very risky, maximally risky, securities, you cannot possibly lose more than 10 percent, while you are exposed to massive upside. Someone with 100 percent in so-called “medium” risk securities has a risk of total ruin from the miscomputation of risks.

1. Cui Jian is China’s rock ’n’ roll king, whose throaty voice and poignant lyrics have caused him to be compared to American superstar Bruce Springsteen.

## The Divided Self
**Author:** R. Laing

### Highlights (6)

1. The thought is the language, as Wittgenstein has put it. A technical vocabulary is merely a language within a language. A consideration of this technical vocabulary will be at the same time an attempt to discover the reality which the words disclose or conceal.

3. The greatest psychopathologist has been Freud. Freud was a hero. He descended to the ‘Underworld’ and met there stark terrors. He carried with him his theory as a Medusa’s head which turned these terrors to stone. We who follow Freud have the benefit of the knowledge he brought back with him and conveyed to us. He survived. We must see if we now can survive without using a theory that is in some measure an instrument of defence.
   - Location: 341-344
   - Page: 23

4. The clinical psychiatrist, wishing to be more ‘scientific’ or ‘objective’, may propose to confine himself to the ‘objectively’ observable behaviour of the patient before him. The simplest reply to this is that it is impossible. To see ‘signs’ of disease’ is not to see neutrally. Nor is it neutral to see a smile as contractions of the circumoral muscles (Merleau-Ponty, 1953).

5. We explain [writes Dilthey] by means of purely intellectual processes, but we understand by means of the cooperation of all the powers of the mind in comprehension. In understanding we start from the connection of the given, living whole, in order to make the past comprehensible in terms of it.
   - Location: 464-466
   - Page: 31

6. I suggest, therefore, that sanity or psychosis is tested by the degree of conjunction or disjunction between two persons where the one is sane by common consent. The critical test of whether or not a patient is psychotic is a lack of congruity, an incongruity, a clash, between him and me.

1. Charles Darwin: "False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science for they often endure long; but false hypotheses do little harm, as everyone takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path toward error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened."

Just as the peacock's large, iridescent tail or the size of a majestic bull elephant's tusks constitutes "truth in advertising" for the animal's health, so the human ability to croon a tune or pen a sonnet might be a marker for a superior brain.

1. Fear of the future causes us to lean against and cling to the present, while faith in the future renders us receptive to change.

2. Emigration offers some of the things the frustrated hope to find when they join a mass movement, namely, change and a chance for a new beginning. The same types who swell the ranks of a rising mass movement are also likely to avail themselves of a chance to emigrate. Thus migration can serve as a substitute for a mass movement. It is plausible, for instance, that had the United States and the British Empire welcomed mass migration from Europe after the First World War, there might have been neither a Fascist nor a Nazi revolution.

3. Every mass movement is in a sense a migration—a movement toward a promised land; and, when feasible and expedient, an actual migration takes place. This happened in the case of the Puritans, Anabaptists, Mormons, Dukhobors and Zionists. Migration, in the mass, strengthens the spirit and unity of a movement; and whether in the form of foreign conquest, crusade, pilgrimage or settlement of new land it is practiced by most active mass movements.

3. Publishing in the journal Nature in 1964, Bear and Thomas proposed a name for the scent brought on by rain. They called it “petrichor,” a blend of the Greek words petra, rock, and ikhor, the ethereal fluid that flowed as blood in the veins of the gods. But the scientists acknowledged that they were not the first to identify the stormy smell. They were not even the first to extract it. In fact, the element they dubbed petrichor was already the signature fragrance in an attar produced in an ancient perfumery found in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, in the village of Kannauj. The scientists flubbed the name of the fragrance, which is called mitti ka attar. But they got the translation right: Extracted from parched clay on the eve of the monsoons, and distilled with techniques dating to the Harappan, the scent of rain, in India, is known as Earth’s perfume.

## The Dorito Effect: The Surprising New Truth About Food and Flavor
**Author:** Mark Schatzker

### Highlights (7)

1. As soon as Debbie saw it, certain parts of her brain became “activated,” which is to say they drew in lots of blood as millions of neurons were fired. These regions—the left medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and three other small, curly pockets of gray matter—are all associated with “motivation.” And the functional MRI (fMRI) showed them glowing a bright yellowy orange, like coals in a hot fire, indicating those parts of her brain were churning through quite a lot of blood. She was experiencing “incentive salience,” the scientific term for a Frankenstein craving, or a heightened state of “wanting.”

2. Debbie got what she wanted. Five seconds after the image of the milk shake flashed, actual chocolate milk shake was squirted into her mouth through a syringe pump. The cold burst of liquid chocolate lasted five seconds. Now her orbitofrontal cortex, which is associated with “reward,” was glowing hot.

## Friendship
**Author:** A. C. Grayling

If one has ten, fifty, a hundred, a thousand ‘friends’ on Facebook, are they all friends? If they are, are they all equally friends? Does the distinction between friends and acquaintances take on a particular significance in the Facebook age? As with at least some other matters of significance, the ancient world is not without insights.

13. Giovanni Boccaccio, standing on the threshold of the Renaissance, wrote this at the end of his Tenth Day story of Titus and Gisippus in the Decameron: Friendship, then, is a most sacred thing, worthy not only of singular reverence but of being commended with perpetual praise, as the most discreet mother of liberality and honour, the sister of gratitude and charity, the enemy of hatred and avarice, ever ready, without waiting to be asked, to do virtuously to another what it would wish done to itself. Its sacred results are today most rarely to be seen in two persons, by the fault and to the shame of men’s miserable cupidity which makes them look only to their own interests; so friendship has been driven to the ends of the earth and left in perpetual exile.

18. friendship embodies not just camaraderie and enjoyment, which any acquaintances might share, but a deeper tie with an essentially mutual character, however that works in practice; it is at least supportive, forgiving, and durable, when it is at its best.
   - Location: 2043-2045
   - Page: 134

19. Durability has two meanings: robustness under pressure, and survival over a long period. In friendship it is desirable in both senses, and old friendships might by that very fact be the best kind; but the ‘long period of time’ sense is not necessary. Friendships do not fail to count as such because they end; it is common enough for people who were friends in the fullest and richest sense to cease to be so after a time, for any number of reasons, even if they are usually bad ones.

21. a friend is a person one likes who returns one’s affection and concern; who shares some of one’s interests and attitudes; who gives when asked or even without being asked; who understands, or tries to, without being too judgemental; who is loyal and constant, rejoicing at good fortune and supporting through bad; who tells unpleasant truths and pleasant untruths when either is necessary; whose affection is freely given, not bartered for services or advancement or other interest; and who makes the innocent and proper assumption that all the claims, expectations, rights and duties of this vital and valuable human bond are reciprocal. Reciprocity is indispensable.

   - Location: 2240-2242
   - Page: 147

23. One good thing about friendship which has survived changes in social conventions is that it is a resource of guidance and correction. A loyal friend whom one trusts can tell us when we are going wrong, reprove us, advise us, can suggest a course of action when we are wavering in a dilemma, can stand up for us or do something for us when we need an ally. She can also tell us helpful lies when we need reassurance or calming down.

24. friendship has its negative aspects and dangers too. One is that when we make friends, we contract for grief. This is the same for love. Inevitably, one of any pair (save for the rare cases of both being in the same plane crash) is going to be bereft of the other – by death, by divorce, by the drifting apart that time brings as people and circumstances change.

25. No one other person will ever satisfy all the interests, needs and desires that each individual typically has.

## The Wandering Mind: What the Brain Does When You're Not Looking
**Author:** Michael C. Corballis

### Highlights (19)

1. I argue that mind-wandering has many constructive and adaptive features—indeed, we probably couldn’t do without it. It includes mental time travel—the wandering back and forth through time, not only to plan our futures based on past experience, but also to generate a continuous sense of who we are. Mind-wandering allows us to inhabit the minds of others, increasing empathy and social understanding. Through mind-wandering, we invent, tell stories, expand our mental horizons. Mind-wandering underwrites creativity, whether as a Wordsworth wandering lonely as a cloud, or an Einstein

2. I have been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened. —Mark Twain Our memories are not only incomplete, they are also often inaccurate, and we sometimes ‘remember’ things that didn’t actually happen.
   - Location: 365-368
   - Page: 24

3. So why is memory so bad? It was clearly not designed by nature to be a faithful record of the past. Rather, it supplies us with information—some true, some false, and always incomplete—that we use to construct stories. ‘Memory is a poet, not an historian’, the American poet Marie Howe once said.
   - Location: 415-417
   - Page: 28

4. Ulric Neisser, one of the giants of cognitive psychology, wrote: ‘Remembering is not like playing back a tape or looking at a picture; it is more like telling a story.’ And the story that it tells is as often directed to the future as to the past,

5. evidence shows, in fact, that people spend more time thinking about the future than about the past.
   - Location: 440-440
   - Page: 29

6. Many of the scenarios we envisage in the future, such as a dinner party, are based on past episodes, with some rearrangement to accommodate a new location, or a new combination of people. Perhaps this helps explain why memory for episodes itself is not always accurate. If we are to design futures based on our memories, we need our memories to be useful rather than accurate.
   - Location: 480-483
   - Page: 32

7. The very flexibility of our memories can make for well-adjusted futures, but play havoc with the remembered past. As children grow, their capacities to remember the past and imagine the future seem to surface together, somewhere between the ages of three and four.

8. default-mode network. This is the ‘mind-wandering’ network, and includes prefrontal lobes, temporal lobes and parietal lobes.
   - Location: 651-652
   - Page: 43

9. The hippocampus is the Grand Central Station of this network, reciprocally connected to other areas in the network, including both the cortical areas above and the more emotional areas below. It is responsible for what has been called ‘temporal consciousness’, or knowing where you are in the ribbon of time. Oddly enough, although people with damage to the hippocampus seem lost in time and stuck in the present, they may still be able to answer questions about events in time that do not involve themselves—such as the death of Princess Diana, or what the next medical breakthroughs are likely to be. The job description of the hippocampus, it seems, is to deal with personal matters—the recording and retrieval of personal events, and the making of personal plans.
   - Location: 653-658
   - Page: 43

10. The hippocampus seems to be a forward-looking structure, with the front (anterior) end concerned more with the future and the rear (posterior) end with the past. In our Cluedo study, when people imagined future scenarios, and were later asked to try to remember them, both ends of the hippocampus were often activated. That is, imagined scenes were also remembered as though they had actually occurred. This could perhaps help explain why some memories are false—for instance, why Hillary Clinton remembered running to escape gunfire when she arrived in Bosnia, when in fact her arrival was peaceful and welcoming. Maybe she had imagined the threatening scenario before arriving there, and this memory had lodged in her brain as though it had actually happened. But who knows? Possibly Hillary herself doesn’t know.

The psychologist David Premack takes it even deeper, suggesting: ‘Women think that men think that they think that men think that women’s orgasm is different.’ Well, he’s a mere man, and it is he who thinks that, taking it deeper still.

14. Dreaming itself, though, may be slow to develop. Preschoolers do dream, but reports suggest that their dreams are simple and static, without emotion and with no involvement of the dreamer. Night terrors experienced by some children are probably not the result of bad dreams, but seem to be induced by the disorientation caused by not being properly awake. David Foulkes found that children under the age of seven report dreams when awakened from REM sleep only 20 per cent of the time, compared with 80 to 90 per cent in adults.
   - Location: 1353-1356
   - Page: 89

15. Dreams might roughly parallel the development of mental time travel itself. As explained earlier, it’s not until the age of about four that the child can mentally escape the present and envisage coherent scenarios in which they are somewhere else at some other time. At around the age of seven, dreams develop a narrative quality, and incorporate characters that move around, including the child as the dreaming self.

18. A great many writers in the nineteenth century took opium in the search for inspiration, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, John Keats, Edgar Allan Poe, Sir Walter Scott, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Robert Louis Stevenson; one wonders where nineteenth-century literature would have been without it. It was not just writers. The American polymath, inventor and scientist Benjamin Franklin experimented with both hashish and opium.

19. If you’re seeking inspiration, it seems a good idea to take a break and do something undemanding, like washing the dishes or watching a light TV show. Or perhaps knitting, which could explain why Agatha’s Christie’s Miss Marple, a compulsive knitter, was able to solve murder mysteries.

## The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-But Some Don't
**Author:** Nate Silver

### Highlights (54)

1. The instinctual shortcut that we take when we have “too much information” is to engage with it selectively, picking out the parts we like and ignoring the remainder, making allies with those who have made the same choices and enemies of the rest.

2. The term forecast came from English’s Germanic roots,20 unlike predict, which is from Latin.21 Forecasting reflected the new Protestant worldliness rather than the otherworldliness of the Holy Roman Empire. Making a forecast typically implied planning under conditions of uncertainty. It suggested having prudence, wisdom, and industriousness, more like the way we now use the word foresight. 22 The theological implications of this idea

6. On the basis of their responses to these questions, Tetlock was able to classify his experts along a spectrum between what he called hedgehogs and foxes. The reference to hedgehogs and foxes comes from the title of an Isaiah Berlin essay on the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy—The Hedgehog and the Fox. Berlin had in turn borrowed his title from a passage attributed to the Greek poet Archilochus: “The fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”
   - Location: 890-893
   - Page: 58

7. Hedgehogs are type A personalities who believe in Big Ideas—in governing principles about the world that behave as though they were physical laws and undergird virtually every interaction in society. Think Karl Marx and class struggle, or Sigmund Freud and the unconscious. Or Malcolm Gladwell and the “tipping point.” Foxes, on the other hand, are scrappy creatures who believe in a plethora of little ideas and in taking a multitude of approaches toward a problem. They tend to be more tolerant of nuance, uncertainty, complexity, and dissenting opinion. If hedgehogs are hunters, always looking out for the big kill, then foxes are gatherers.
   - Location: 895-900
   - Page: 59

8. Foxes sometimes have more trouble fitting into type A cultures like television, business, and politics. Their belief that many problems are hard to forecast—and that we should be explicit about accounting for these uncertainties—may be mistaken for a lack of self-confidence. Their pluralistic approach may be mistaken for a lack of conviction; Harry Truman famously demanded a “one-handed economist,” frustrated that the foxes in his administration couldn’t give him an unqualified answer. But foxes happen to make much better predictions. They are quicker to recognize how noisy the data can be, and they are less inclined to chase false signals. They know more about what they don’t know.

14. One way to judge a forecast, Murphy wrote—perhaps the most obvious one—was through what he called “quality,” but which might be better defined as accuracy. That is, did the actual weather match the forecast? A second measure was what Murphy labeled “consistency” but which I think of as honesty. However accurate the forecast turned out to be, was it the best one the forecaster was capable of at the time? Did it reflect her best judgment, or was it modified in some way before being presented to the public? Finally, Murphy said, there was the economic value of a forecast. Did it help the public and policy makers to make better decisions?
   - Location: 2125-2130
   - Page: 139

15. There are two basic tests that any weather forecast must pass to demonstrate its merit: It must do better than what meteorologists call persistence: the assumption that the weather will be the same tomorrow (and the next day) as it was today. It must also beat climatology, the long-term historical average of conditions on a particular date in a particular area.
   - Location: 2149-2153
   - Page: 141

16. The statistical reality of accuracy isn’t necessarily the governing paradigm when it comes to commercial weather forecasting. It’s more the perception of accuracy that adds value in the eyes of the consumer. For instance, the for-profit weather forecasters rarely predict exactly a 50 percent chance of rain, which might seem wishy-washy and indecisive to consumers.41 Instead, they’ll flip a coin and round up to 60, or down to 40, even though this makes the forecasts both less accurate and less honest.

17. People notice one type of mistake—the failure to predict rain—more than another kind, false alarms. If it rains when it isn’t supposed to, they curse the weatherman for ruining their picnic, whereas an unexpectedly sunny day is taken as a serendipitous bonus. It

18. The terms “prediction” and “forecast” are employed differently in different fields; in some cases, they are interchangeable, but other disciplines differentiate them. No field is more sensitive to the distinction than seismology. If you’re speaking with a seismologist: A prediction is a definitive and specific statement about when and where an earthquake will strike: a major earthquake will hit Kyoto, Japan, on June 28. Whereas a forecast is a probabilistic statement, usually over a longer time scale: there is a 60 percent chance of an earthquake in Southern California over the next thirty years. The USGS’s official position is that earthquakes cannot be predicted. They can, however, be forecasted.
   - Location: 2428-2434
   - Page: 159

19. A Parade of Failed Forecasts Hough’s 2009 book, Predicting the Unpredictable: The Tumultuous Science of Earthquake Prediction, is a history of efforts to predict earthquakes, and is as damning to that enterprise as Phil Tetlock’s study was to political pundits. There just seems to have been no progress at all, and there have been many false alarms.
   - Location: 2571-2574
   - Page: 168

20. Earthquakes may be an inherently complex process. The theory of complexity that the late physicist Per Bak and others developed is different from chaos theory, although the two are often lumped together. Instead, the theory suggests that very simple things can behave in strange and mysterious ways when they interact with one another. Bak’s favorite example was that of a sandpile on a beach. If you drop another grain of sand onto the pile (what could be simpler than a grain of sand?), it can actually do one of three things. Depending on the shape and size of the pile, it might stay more or less where it lands, or it might cascade gently down the small hill toward the bottom of the pile. Or it might do something else: if the pile is too steep, it could destabilize the entire system and trigger a sand avalanche.

22. The challenge to economists might be compared to the one faced by weather forecasters. They face two of the same fundamental problems. First, the economy, like the atmosphere, is a dynamic system: everything affects everything else and the systems are perpetually in motion. In meteorology, this problem is quite literal, since the weather is subject to chaos theory—a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can theoretically cause a tornado in Texas. But in loosely the same way, a tsunami in Japan or a longshoreman’s strike in Long Beach can affect whether someone in Texas finds a job. Second, weather forecasts are subject to uncertain initial conditions. The probabilistic expression of weather forecasts (“there’s a 70 percent chance of rain”) arises not because there is any inherent randomness in the weather. Rather, the problem is that meteorologists assume they have imprecise measurements of what the initial conditions were like, and weather patterns (because they are subject to chaos theory) are extremely sensitive to changes in the initial conditions. In economic forecasting, likewise, the quality of the initial data is frequently quite poor.

23. This kind of statement is becoming more common in the age of Big Data.56 Who needs theory when you have so much information? But this is categorically the wrong attitude to take toward forecasting, especially in a field like economics where the data is so noisy. Statistical inferences are much stronger when backed up by theory or at least some deeper thinking about their root causes.

24. Extrapolation is a very basic method of prediction—usually, much too basic. It simply involves the assumption that the current trend will continue indefinitely, into the future. Some of the best-known failures of prediction have resulted from applying this assumption too liberally. At the turn of the twentieth century, for instance, many city planners were concerned about the increasing use of horse-drawn carriages and their main pollutant: horse manure. Knee-deep in the issue in 1894, one writer in the Times of London predicted that by the 1940s, every street in London would be buried under nine feet of the stuff.45 About ten years later, fortunately, Henry Ford began producing his prototypes of the Model T and the crisis was averted.

25. If you can’t make a good prediction, it is very often harmful to pretend that you can. I suspect that epidemiologists, and others in the medical community, understand this because of their adherence to the Hippocratic oath. Primum non nocere: First, do no harm. Much of the most thoughtful work on the use and abuse of statistical models and the proper role of prediction comes from people in the medical profession.88 That is not to say there is nothing on the line when an economist makes a prediction, or a seismologist does. But because of medicine’s intimate connection with life and death, doctors tend to be appropriately cautious. In their field, stupid models kill people. It has a sobering effect.

30. Suppose you are living with a partner and come home from a business trip to discover a strange pair of underwear in your dresser drawer. You will probably ask yourself: what is the probability that your partner is cheating on you? The condition is that you have found the underwear; the hypothesis you are interested in evaluating is the probability that you are being cheated on. Bayes’s theorem, believe it or not, can give you an answer to this sort of question—provided that you know (or are willing to estimate) three quantities:

31. Fisher and his contemporaries instead sought to develop a set of statistical methods that they hoped would free us from any possible contamination from bias. This brand of statistics is usually called “frequentism” today, although the term “Fisherian” (as opposed to Bayesian) is sometimes applied to it.47 The idea behind frequentism is that uncertainty in a statistical problem results exclusively from collecting data among just a sample of the population rather than the whole population.
   - Location: 4075-4079
   - Page: 266

32. Essentially, the frequentist approach toward statistics seeks to wash its hands of the reason that predictions most often go wrong: human error. It views uncertainty as something intrinsic to the experiment rather than something intrinsic to our ability to understand the real world. The frequentist method also implies that, as you collect more data, your error will eventually approach zero: this will be both necessary and sufficient to solve any problems.
   - Location: 4091-4094
   - Page: 267

33. Nor is the frequentist method particularly objective, either in theory or in practice. Instead, it relies on a whole host of assumptions. It usually presumes that the underlying uncertainty in a measurement follows a bell-curve or normal distribution.
   - Location: 4097-4099
   - Page: 268

34. This is often a good assumption, but not in the case of something like the variation in the stock market. The frequentist approach requires defining a sample population, something that is straightforward in the case of a political poll but which is largely arbitrary in many other practical applications. What “sample population” was the September 11 attack drawn from?
   - Location: 4099-4101
   - Page: 268

35. The bigger problem, however, is that the frequentist methods—in striving for immaculate statistical procedures that can’t be contaminated by the researcher’s bias—keep him hermetically sealed off from the real world. These methods discourage the researcher from considering the underlying context or plausibility of his hypothesis, something that the Bayesian method demands in the form of a prior probability.

36. Thus, you will see apparently serious papers published on how toads can predict earthquakes,50 or how big-box stores like Target beget racial hate groups,51 which apply frequentist tests to produce “statistically significant” (but manifestly ridiculous) findings.
   - Location: 4104-4107
   - Page: 268

37. Fisher’s statistical philosophy tends to conceive of the world. It emphasizes the objective purity of the experiment—every hypothesis could be tested to a perfect conclusion if only enough data were collected. However, in order to achieve that purity, it denies the need for Bayesian priors or any other sort of messy real-world context. These methods neither require nor encourage us to think about the plausibility of our hypothesis: the idea that cigarettes cause lung cancer competes on a level playing field with the idea that toads predict earthquakes.

39. The critique I have made here about the flaws of Fisher’s statistical approach is neither novel nor radical: prominent scholars in fields ranging from clinical psychology65 to political science66 to ecology67 have made similar arguments for years. But so far there has been little fundamental change. Recently, however, some well-respected statisticians have begun to argue that frequentist statistics should no longer be taught to undergraduates.68 And some professions have considered banning Fisher’s hypothesis test from their journals.69 In fact, if you read what’s been written in the past ten years, it’s hard to find anything that doesn’t advocate a Bayesian approach.

41. Adam Smith and Thomas Bayes were contemporaries, and both were educated in Scotland and were heavily influenced by the philosopher David Hume. Smith’s “invisible hand” might be thought of as a Bayesian process, in which prices are gradually updated in response to changes in supply and demand, eventually reaching some equilibrium. Or, Bayesian reasoning might be thought of as an “invisible hand” wherein we gradually update and improve our beliefs as we debate our ideas, sometimes placing bets on them when we can’t agree. Both are consensus-seeking processes

42. First, while the aggregate forecast will essentially always be better than the typical individual’s forecast, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will be good. For instance, aggregate macroeconomic forecasts are much too crude to predict recessions more than a few months in advance. They are somewhat better than individual economists’ forecasts, however.

43. Second, the most robust evidence indicates that this wisdom-of-crowds principle holds when forecasts are made independently before being averaged together. In a true betting market (including the stock market), people can and do react to one another’s behavior. Under these conditions, where the crowd begins to behave more dynamically, group behavior becomes more complex.

44. Third, although the aggregate forecast is better than the typical individual’s forecast, it does not necessarily hold that it is better than the best individual’s forecast. Perhaps there is some polling firm, for instance, whose surveys are so accurate that it is better to use their polls and their polls alone rather than dilute them with numbers from their less-accurate peers.

51. Our views on how predictable the world is have waxed and waned over the years. One simple measure of it is the number of times the words “predictable” and “unpredictable” are used in academic journals.15 At the dawn of the twentieth century, the two words were used almost exactly as often as one another. The Great Depression and the Second World War catapulted “unpredictable” into the dominant position. As the world healed from these crises, “predictable” came back into fashion, its usage peaking in the 1970s. “Unpredictable” has been on the rise again in recent years.

4. Sushi is dipped in soy sauce before placing it in the mouth. In some shops the sauce is diluted with small amounts of water or dashi stock. The taste of fresh fish is better appreciated by dipping not the rice side but the fish side of the sushi and placing the same fish side on the tongue, but doing this with chopsticks is rather difficult. One must pick up the nigiri-zushi with the chopsticks, twist the wrist to dip the fish topping in the sauce, and then get it onto the tongue keeping the fish side down. Without skill and care, the fish may fall off. However, there is no need to do it the hard way. Eating nigiri-zushi with the fingers is not bad manners, but rather a mark of people who know sushi well. The original edomae sushi was sold at outdoor stalls where the customers were served standing, and it was always eaten with the fingers. Thin slices of pickled ginger are also served with sushi. As the diner switches from one variety of fish to another, eating a bit of this ginger extinguishes the flavour of the previous fish and refreshes the mouth to make it ready for the next one.

## The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do
**Author:** Judith Rich Harris

### Highlights (26)

1. The Effects of the Effects of the Genes Genes contain the instructions for producing a physical body and a physical brain. They determine the shape of the facial features and the structure and chemistry of the brain. These physical manifestations of heredity are the straightforward consequences of carrying out the instructions in the genes; I call them direct genetic effects. Timidity can be a direct genetic effect; some babies are born with hypersensitive nervous systems.16 Being born beautiful is a direct genetic effect. Direct genetic effects have consequences of their own, which I call indirect genetic effects—the effects of the effects of the genes. A child’s timidity causes his mother to reassure him, his sister to make fun of him, and his peers to pick on him. A child’s beauty causes her parents to dote on her and wins her a wide circle of admiring friends. These are indirect genetic effects. Identical twins lead similar lives because of indirect genetic effects.

4. My husband and I didn’t treat our two daughters alike: they weren’t alike. It would have been impossible to use the same tactics on both of them and foolish to try. Of the mistakes made by the style-of-parenting researchers, the most serious is to assume that a parenting style is a characteristic of a parent. It is a characteristic of the relationship between a parent and a child. Both parties contribute to it.

5. The New Zealand researchers gave personality tests to about a thousand young people and found that certain traits were good predictors of risky behavior. Eighteen-year-olds who are impulsive and quick to anger, who aren’t afraid of danger and who seek excitement, are more likely to drink too much, drive too fast, and engage in risky sex. These same young people also tend to have difficulty establishing and maintaining close personal relationships.

6. So let me begin with a true story, told by my late colleague David Lykken, about a pair of reared-apart twins—one of the pairs studied at the University of Minnesota by the research team of which he was a member. They are identical twins separated in infancy; they grew up in different adoptive homes. One became a concert pianist, talented enough to perform as a soloist with the Minnesota Orchestra. The other cannot play a note. Since these women have the same genes, the disparity must be due to a difference in their environments. Sure enough, one of the adoptive mothers was a music teacher who gave piano lessons in her home. The parents who adopted the other twin were not musical at all. Only it was the nonmusical parents who produced the concert pianist and the piano teacher whose daughter cannot play a note.1

7. Anything learned at home and kept at home—not scrutinized by the peer group—may be passed on from parents to their kids.
   - Location: 7064-7065
   - Page: 461

8. Furthermore, some things that are learned at home may be retained even if they are brought to the peer group—even if they are different—because groups demand conformity only up to a point. There are behaviors that are obligatory and those that are optional, and which is which depends upon the group you’re in. Language is one of the obligatory ones in any children’s group: a kid who comes to the group with a different language or accent is expected to change, and does change. In boys’ groups during middle childhood, it is obligatory to behave in a “masculine” manner: tough, unemotional, concerned about status. Girls’ groups grant more leeway to deviate from the “feminine” pattern of behavior. This difference in how strictly the patterns are enforced may reflect a sex difference: groupness appears
   - Location: 7067-7073
   - Page: 461

9. Patriotism is obligatory to the members of a group during times of war but may be optional in peacetime. As a result of changes in the adult culture, it is possible that boys’ groups will become more permissive about the range of behaviors they allow their members. So far, however, developmentalists have seen no signs of such a shift.5 If knowledge, skills, or opinions acquired at home are in an area that the peer group regards as optional—an area where conformity is not enforced, where differences may even be appreciated—the child may retain them. Most children’s peer groups permit their members to vary in their talents, hobbies, political preferences, and future career plans.6 The kid who knows how to play the piano is not a nail that needs hammering down. Children learn how to play the piano at home. They learn what it’s like to be a doctor or why it’s best to be a Democrat or how to wrap the corn husks around the tamales. What they don’t learn at home is how to behave in public and what sort of people they are. These are things they learn in the peer group.
   - Location: 7074-7083
   - Page: 462

10. Where groupness is weak or absent, differentiation triumphs over assimilation. The members of a family diversify, each seeking something to specialize in, a personal niche to fill. This niche-picking widens the family’s assortment of skills and reduces head-to-head competition between siblings. But parents, too, occupy family niches and can, from the child’s point of view, fill them up.8Perhaps that is why the twin with the piano-teacher mother never learned to play: her family already had a piano player. The daughter would have had to compete with her mother if she took up the same instrument. What a pity her parents didn’t encourage her to take up the tuba!

11. Leaders, as I said in Chapter 11, can influence the behavioral norms of a group. They can define the stereotype the members have of themselves and the boundaries of the group—who is us and who is them. Can a parent ever be a leader of this sort? Can he or she form the family into a cohesive group and delineate its goals? Yes. But it happens rarely in Western societies, perhaps because Western families tend to be small and it may require a family group of a minimum size. The other requirement is a strong and determined parent.

12. The danger in raising a prodigy is that many of these kids lack a peer group—they miss out on normal relationships with other kids their age. Children who do not have normal peer relationships are at risk of turning out peculiar. Though garden-variety gifted children generally fare very well, the true prodigies—the ones who are off the chart—have more than their share of psychological problems.

13. If it were up to me, I would take the risk that my child might be rejected and put her or him into the best school I could find—a school with smart, hardworking kids. A school where no one makes fun of the one who reads books and makes A’s.
   - Location: 7199-7200

14. Unfortunately, your power to influence your children’s friendships shrinks as they get larger. With little children, parents have almost complete control over who their friends are, at least when they are not in school. But once they turn ten, all bets are off. If you forbid an older kid to see her friends, and if she is the kind of kid who is attracted to the kind of friends you don’t want her to see, there’s a good chance she will see them behind your back and lie about it. And lying quickly becomes a habit, if it isn’t already.
   - Location: 7220-7223
   - Page: 471

15. There is one other circumstance in which it might be worth considering a move: if your kid is getting picked on all the time. If my kid were at the very bottom of the local totem pole, and if all the higher-ups were beating on him, I would want to get him out of there. Victims are victimized partly because they get a reputation for being victimizable, and it is extremely difficult to change the peer group’s mind about things like that. Usually, moving is a disadvantage for a kid because he loses his peer group and whatever status he had in it. But if the peer group is making his life miserable and his status is zero, he doesn’t have much to lose.

20. Status in the peer group is a chancy thing. Groups typecast their members, often for trivial reasons—random events, superficial differences. The kid who wets his pants on the first day of first grade, the kid who uses a three-syllable word on the first day of first grade, may be pinned with labels they will wear for years, maybe even forever.
   - Location: 7276-7278
   - Page: 475

21. Parents cannot prevent their children from being typecast in negative ways in the peer group. However, they can make it a little less likely to happen. They do have some control over the way their children look, and their goal should be to make them look as normal and as attractive as possible, because looks do count. “Normal” means dressing the child in the same kind of clothing the other kids are wearing.
   - Location: 7280-7283
   - Page: 475

22. Children don’t want to be different, and for good reason: oddness is not considered a virtue in the peer group. Even giving a kid a weird or silly name can put him at a disadvantage. I heard of a father who thought it clever to name his son after his favorite poet. Unfortunately, his favorite poet was Homer.

23. Children are keenly aware, not only of how their parents treat them, but of how they are treated relative to their brothers and sisters. If they feel that their siblings are getting a better deal than they are, the resulting resentments can poison their relationships with their parents (and with their siblings), sometimes for a lifetime.

This particular hormone has made headlines for its link to belly fat. That’s because one of the many things cortisol does to help you flee the mammoth is to make energy—in the form of glucose—available for use in your bloodstream. But if the cause of your stress isn’t chasing you across the tundra, this newly available glucose isn’t needed to combat the stress right away. Instead it ends up getting stored in your belly, as fat.29 So on a chemical level, stress causes weight gain.

5. Stress also leads people to act in ways that cause weight gain. Studies have shown that stress causes us to overeat,30 exercise less, and sleep less. It is no surprise that eating more and exercising less leads to some weight gain, but many people underestimate the role of sleep when it comes to weight maintenance.

9. Multitasking is the normal state of existence for most of us, rather than the occasional hurried exception. In fact, in his book The Shallows,15 Nicholas Carr argues that the Internet is slowly destroying our “capacity for concentration,” by training us to quickly scan and skim small pieces of information from all over the Internet, rather than focusing deeply on any one thing.

11. What we found was that the dieters who were distracted by the slide show ate about 40 percent more of the candy and chips than dieters who didn’t watch the slide show. Distraction interfered with their ability to control their eating. The non-dieters, on the other hand, ate about 30 percent less when they were distracted than when they weren’t. Non-dieters’ eating habits are pretty sensible, if you think about it. They are occupied with whatever is distracting them, so they don’t have the time or inclination to focus on anything else, including food. This is a pattern that we notice time and time again, not just in our own work, but in that of other researchers, too.22 Lots of everyday events cause dieters to overeat, but don’t have the same effect on non-dieters.

13. no matter how much willpower you may have, it is a limited resource. You can only use it for a little while before it runs out—and when that happens, it takes some time for it to replenish. Think of it like working a muscle. If you want to get strong arms and you do as many push-ups as you can, eventually your arms will start to shake and you can’t go any further. That’s because you have depleted the resources of those muscles. You know that you have to rest and refuel before you can use them again. Self-control isn’t a muscle, but it does seem to work in much the same way. If you are relying on the strength of your willpower to control one thing, you’ll be less able to exercise self-control over the next thing you encounter.

There is plenty of evidence that the larger the portion, the more you eat.11 The larger the cereal box (or any box) you serve yourself from, the more you take and the more you eat.12 The larger the serving spoon you serve yourself with or the serving bowl you serve yourself from, the more you take and the more you eat.13 You’ll even eat more from one big chocolate bar than you would if you were given that same amount of chocolate, but in several small bars.14

18. Brian Wansink, head of Cornell’s Food & Brand Lab and author of Mindless Eating. In one of his clever food studies he created a bottomless soup bowl: a bowl that subtly refills itself while you eat from it, so it never looks like it is emptying.15 How’d he do that? Something complicated with tubes and pipes and pressure physics. But what he learned by having study participants unknowingly eat from this deceptive bowl is that people have no idea how much they are eating, and they decide how full they feel based on what they see, not how they feel. So if they see that their bowl of soup is full, they assume they haven’t eaten much, and that they are still hungry, even though they may have eaten the equivalent of two (or more) full bowls.

19. But we can also take advantage of this concept in reverse. If you use a smaller plate and fill it up, you think you are eating more food, because food on a small plate looks like more food than that same amount of food on a big plate.17 This tricks you into feeling full sooner, and amazingly, it still works even when you know about it.18 The small plate also forces you to serve yourself less food, and the less you have on your plate, the less you eat.

It won’t turn as easily, so it will be incrementally harder to rip toilet paper off the roll. When that happens, people use less. This is a tiny inconvenience. I might even argue that this is the tiniest possible inconvenience. And yet it alters people’s behavior enough that this tip routinely turns up as a suggestion for thriftiness in blogs about saving money.21 Here’s why it works: People are lazy. Even the most hardworking among us are, on some level, pretty lazy.

21. effectiveness of tiny obstacles was documented in the United Kingdom, after laws required acetaminophen (Tylenol) to be packaged in small blister packs instead of bottles.22 To use the medication from a blister pack, each individual pill must be pushed out of the packaging separately from the other pills, and it is harder to grab a handful at once. That small obstacle to accessing pills was linked to a 21 percent reduction in suicides and accidental poisonings from the over-the-counter drug.

26. Creating small obstacles can help us limit how much unhealthy food we eat, but when we want to eat more of a certain kind of food, we want to do the opposite: remove as many barriers as possible. For example, if you want to eat more fruits and vegetables, make them easier to access. Make them unavoidable. Have a fruit bowl (with fruit in it) on your table. Sounds obvious and too easy, doesn’t it? But it works.

27. Having the fruit in ready-to-eat form helps, too. The effort of peeling an orange can be an insurmountable obstacle, no matter how good a peeler you are. Peeling bananas, on the other hand, is a no-brainer, so they are easily eaten from a fruit bowl. Grapes are even easier, because all you have to do is grab some.

28. There are a few ways you can arrange to get alone with a vegetable. One of the simplest ways to do this is to mimic our approach with the school cafeteria study: start every meal with a vegetable.

30. In 1956, social psychologist Solomon Asch demonstrated that people conform to those around them when he asked research participants to reply out loud, one at a time, to a very easy multiple-choice question.1 Although the answer was obviously choice A, the first six students gave the answer B loud and clear. They were secretly in cahoots with Dr. Asch, who had told them ahead of time to say B. But the seventh student was not in on the secret. Asch wanted to know whether this student—and others like him—would give the correct answer or go along with the group. The multiple-choice question was silly and there would not be any consequences to the group or the student if the student gave a different answer from everyone else. Not only that, but the group was made up of strangers that the student did not expect to ever see again. Nevertheless, 75 percent of the students in this situation went along with the group and gave an obviously incorrect answer.2 The pressure to conform has a powerful influence on our behavior.

39. The benefits of exercise are particularly evident among older people, even if they had previously been sedentary. Becoming active relatively late in life leads to healthier aging, in terms of preventing chronic disease, depression, disability, and memory impairments.53 As people age, their muscle mass and muscle strength decline, but strength training exercise can reverse this.54 Similarly, exercise can also prevent the cognitive decline—in memory and executive function— that tends to occur with age.

40. For a person to get the health benefits of exercise, the U.S. government recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity—or 75 minutes of high-intensity—aerobic exercise per week, along with two sessions of muscle strengthening exercises.56 Moderate intensity exercise is defined as exercise that gets your heart rate up to between 64 and 76 percent of your maximum heart rate (which is based partly on your age and weight).57 This is more intense than people realize,58 so it’s worth using a heart rate monitor to make sure you are working out hard enough.

## The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves
**Author:** Matt Ridley

### Highlights (21)

1. my desk as I write sit two artefacts of roughly the same size and shape: one is a cordless computer mouse; the other a hand axe from the Middle Stone Age, half a million years old. Both are designed to fit the human hand – to obey the constraints of being used by human beings. But they are vastly different. One is a complex confection of many substances with intricate internal design reflecting multiple strands of knowledge. The other is a single substance reflecting the skill of a single individual. The difference between them shows that the human experience of today is vastly different from the human experience of half a million years ago.

2. I shall argue that there was a point in human pre-history when big-brained, cultural, learning people for the first time began to exchange things with each other, and that once they started doing so, culture suddenly became cumulative, and the great headlong experiment of human economic ‘progress’ began. Exchange is to cultural evolution as sex is to biological evolution.

9. Human beings had started to do something to and with each other that in effect began to build a collective intelligence. They had started, for the very first time, to exchange things between unrelated, unmarried individuals; to share, swap, barter and trade. Hence the Nassarius shells moving inland from the Mediterranean. The effect of this was to cause specialisation, which in turn caused technological innovation, which in turn encouraged more specialisation, which led to more exchange – and ‘progress’ was born, by which I mean technology and habits changing faster than anatomy.

10. ‘If I make the clothes, you catch the food’ brings increasing returns. Indeed, it has the beautiful property that it does not even need to be fair.

This is not the same as Adam scratching Oz’s back now and Oz scratching Adam’s back later, or Adam giving Oz some spare food now and Oz giving Adam some spare food tomorrow. The extraordinary promise of this event was that Adam potentially now had access to objects he did not know how to make or find; and so did Oz. And the more they did it, the more valuable it became. For whatever reason, no other animal species ever stumbled upon this trick – at least between unrelated individuals.

And that maybe got them bartering.

14. An evolutionary bargain seems to have been struck: in exchange for sexual exclusivity, the man brings meat and protects the fire from thieves and bullies; in exchange for help rearing the children, the woman brings veg and does much of the cooking.

20. The scene prefigures a game, invented by Werner Guth in the late 1970s and much loved by economists, called the Ultimatum Game, which opens a little window into the human spirit. The first player is given some money and told to divide it with the second player. The second player is told he can accept or refuse the offer, but not change it. If he accepts, he receives the money; if he refuses, neither he nor the first player gets a penny. The question is, how much money should the first player offer the second player? Rationally, he should tender almost nothing, and the second player should accept it, because however small the sum, refusal will only make the second player worse off than acceptance. But in practice, people usually offer close to half the money. Generosity seems to come naturally, or rather, ungenerous behaviour is irrationally foolish, because the second player will – and does – consider a derisory offer worth rejecting, if only to punish the selfishness of the first player.

## Unfair: The New Science of Criminal Injustice
**Author:** Adam Benforado

### Highlights (3)

1. researchers gave experts a DNA sample, telling them that it was part of a gang-rape case in which one of the perpetrators had accepted a plea deal and was testifying against the others. They needed to confirm that one of the suspects who denied any involvement had, in fact, taken part in the rape. As expected, the experts found that his DNA matched the sample, corroborating the witness’s account and the prosecution’s case. However, the researchers then took the same biological evidence and gave it to seventeen other DNA analysts without providing any backstory. What happened? Only one of the seventeen experts agreed with the original group that the DNA was a match. Sequences of amino acids do not rearrange themselves to fit the prosecutor’s frame, but that doesn’t mean there is no room for bias. Someone has to interpret the results. And the first set of analysts couldn’t help but be swayed by the information they had already been given.

Perhaps most important, responders should conduct their own blind assessments of victims—whether that involves giving a cognitive evaluation, searching the crime scene, or conducting a forensic test. Data (“His eyes are not dilating properly, and his pulse is abnormal”) should be shared; labels (“He’s a drunk”) should not. Treating someone based on a label—such as ETOH—should always be a last resort. When we act upon a single label, we almost always lose vital nuance.

3. Sparked by intriguing findings that pathological liars have considerably more white matter (the cells that transmit signals between different areas of the brain) in their prefrontal cortex than the rest of the population, and knowing that white-matter structures have been shown to be associated with creativity, researchers decided to look at whether differences in creativity across the population might influence levels of cheating. Their hypothesis was that people who were more creative would find it easier to come up with convincing stories to justify unethical behavior. Sure enough, in their experiments, the most creative participants were also the most dishonest. Moreover, the researchers found that they could increase cheating across the board by priming people to get them into a creative mindset. Interestingly, general intelligence doesn’t appear to be relevant; it’s specifically creative capacity that matters.

## The Neuroscience of Human Relationships: Attachment and the Developing Social Brain
**Author:** Louis Cozolino

### Highlights (190)

1. there are no single human brains—brains only exist within networks of other brains. The fact that the brain is such a highly specialized social organ of adaptation is both good news and bad news. The good news is that if unexpected challenges emerge, our brains have a greater chance to adapt and survive. When good-enough parenting combines with good-enough genetic programming, our brains are shaped in ways that benefit us throughout life. And the bad news? We are just as capable of adapting to unhealthy environments and pathological caretakers. The resulting adaptations may help us to survive a traumatic childhood but impede healthy development later in life.

2. Those of us who study interpersonal neurobiology believe (and research supports) that friendships, marriage, psychotherapy—in fact, any meaningful relationship—can reactivate neuroplastic processes and actually alter the structures and biochemistry of the brain. In thinking about these processes a multitude of questions arise: How does therapy work? What are the best ways for parents to help build their baby’s brain? Why do some people seem to have no conscience whereas others are crippled with shame and guilt? Why do some find cues to abandonment in almost every human interaction? How does the brain stay healthy and how can we regain mental health after we fall ill?

3. A fundamental characteristic of Western philosophy is the conception of the thinker as alone rather than embedded within a human community. It is a way of understanding the world that leads us to look for answers to human problems through theories and technology rather than within lived experiences and social interactions. Grounded in this philosophy, researchers in neurobiology and neuroscience study the brain in scanners and on dissection tables but neglect the fact that the brain evolved to function within a matrix of other brains.

5. For human babies, survival doesn’t depend on how fast they can run, whether they can climb a tree, or if they can tell the difference between edible and poisonous mushrooms. Rather, they survive based on the abilities of their caretakers to detect the needs and intentions of those around them. For humans, other people are our primary environment. If we are successful in relationships, we will have food, shelter, protection, and children of our own. We get what we need through our interdependence with others.

17. We now know that nature and nurture (genetics and experience) work together to shape our brains, abilities, and disabilities. We also know that the mind arises from the brain and that all psychiatric illnesses involve organic processes. Nature and nurture become one during development, and the line between organic and functional dissolves into what is now called experience-dependent plasticity. This term denotes that our brains are structured and restructured by interactions with our social and natural environments.

20. Brain growth occurs in the hypothalamus of both new-mother and virgin rats that have been given pups to nurture. While rats are performing maternal behaviors, their forebrain and limbic system show increased activation of fos, a protein involved in gene transcription (Lonstein et al., 1997). The presence of fos indicates that, during interactions with her pups, the brain of the mother is being stimulated to grow and learn via activation of the genetic transcription that orchestrates the experience-dependent structural changes of her neurons (Fleming & Korsmit, 1996; Fleming et al., 1994; Stafisso-Sandoz et al., 1998).

23. For us, as highly interdependent creatures, it would make great sense that our health and longevity would be influenced by our active involvement in relationships. Perhaps women live longer because they are traditionally involved in caring for children. Interesting evidence that may support a connection between childcare and longevity comes from looking at parenting across different species of primates. A longevity advantage for females does exist in gorillas, orangutans, and humans in which they are the primary caretakers. On the other hand, in species such as the owl and titi monkey, where the male is the primary caretaker of infants, males tend to survive longer. Male and female Goeldi’s monkeys, who share childcare, have equivalent life spans

24. There is no doubt that touch, at least for social animals, is an important source of social sensory stimulation and a vital mechanism of early brain building. Increased touch results in more exploratory behavior in infancy and childhood, increased attachment security, better memory, and better parenting skills when animals are full grown. All these correlates are indications of decreased anxiety and increased neuroplasticity

25. Mothers tend to hold their babies in their left arms, affording them an enhanced ability to hear their mother’s heartbeat (Sieratzki & Woll, 1996). This position also affords the visual information from the baby direct access to the mother’s right hemisphere. The social and emotional learning gleaned through countless hours of primal resonant interactions serves as the foundation for the gradual development of affect regulation, attachment schema, and self-identity.

26. From the molecular to the political, our existence depends on a constant interaction with, and balancing of, all the forces that contribute to life. Within the central nervous system (CNS) this process is expressed in the excitation and inhibition of neurons, brain structures, and neural networks. What we call affect regulation is the outward expression of just one level of this infinitely complex homeostatic process. Our ability to manage day-to-day stressors and enjoy being inside our own skins depends on our abilities to regulate our emotions.

27. A child maintaining concentration in school, an accountant sticking with a long day of tedious calculations, and a wife going home to her husband despite being attracted to another man—all rely on the inhibition of impulses and emotions while maintaining a memory for future consequences. In addition, these actions require that we keep long-term goals in mind, flexibly solve problems, and consider the perspectives and needs of others.

28. Repeated experiences of moving from regulation to dysregulation and back to a regulated state are stored in networks of sensory, motor, and emotional memory. The participation of caretakers in this process and their repeated assistance in moving a child back to regulated states build and reinforce these circuits. The experience, memory, and control of re-regulation become encoded as implicit memories of positive state transitions. From a psychoanalytic perspective, these implicit memories are our autoregulatory “good inner objects” that bias us toward restoring regulation when we are challenged. Thus, positive parent-child interactions establish an environment within the brain that maximizes positive emotional rebound as well as neural growth and affect regulation.

29. Whereas basic approach-avoidance defensive strategies suffice for nonsocial animals, caretaking, cooperation, and group coherence require continuous self-regulation. We have to know not only whom to approach but also when, how, and for what purposes. Sometimes humans also have to stay in proximity to those whom we don’t fully trust or toward those whom we need to be deferential. We need to have different reactions to the same information based on whether it is coming from friend or foe, adult or child, relative or stranger.

30. Despite the fact that our skin is our largest sense organ, touch has been the least explored of all of the senses (Montagu, 1971). For most of us, being scratched, massaged, and caressed not only feels good but is also an important component of intimacy. Children hang on to their parents, lovers become entangled, and after decades of marriage, it still feels good to hold hands. The touch of someone we love calms, soothes, and decreases stress. When someone is in physical or emotional pain, we move toward them with physical and emotional expressions of warmth and comfort. Clearly, touch is an important channel of communication and a vital mechanism of human bonding.

31. I was fascinated to discover that skin contains two different types of sensory receptors: Some transmit information to the somatosensory cortex for identification and manipulation of objects, whereas others activate the insula, cingulate, and orbital medial cortex, connecting touch with social and emotional experience (Bjornsdotter et al., 2009; Francis et al., 1999; Lindgren et al., 2012; Olausson et al., 2002; Rolls et al., 2003, 2008). This second touch system, connected to the core of the social brain, supports bonding, regulates emotion, and decreases stress. It is this second system that modulates skin-to-skin contact, soothing emotions, hormonal activation, and sexual responses to physical proximity and affectionate caress

32. Ever wonder why scratching our own back doesn’t feel as good as having someone else scratch it for us? Beside the fact that some spots are impossible to reach, reward feels best when it is unpredictable (Berns et al., 2001; Blakemore et al., 2000; Fiorillo et al., 2003; Mirenowicz & Schultz, 1994). Thus familiarity of touch can lead to a decreased sense of reward—which may be responsible for the 7-year itch. Furthermore, the benefits of touch are not restricted to human relationships. All the rubbing, purring, scratching, and petting that goes on between humans and their furry friends point to their value as emotional regulators for us. Petting a cat and having it rub against us activates the same affiliative centers in the brain as human contact (Allman & Brothers, 1994; Machne & Segundo, 1956). I have certainly known quite a few people who, despite their ambivalence about other humans, are completely committed to their cats and dogs.

33. The fact that so much of the social brain develops during the first few years of life creates a number of problems. As adults we find ourselves having thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are often out of line with the current situations of our adult lives. During those first months and years of life, when our worlds are centered on the emotional and unconscious worlds of our parents, the infrastructure of our social brains is unconsciously shaped by our parents’ histories. Joaquin’s story demonstrates how, as adults, we can discover facets of our histories that we have always known, yet never thought about.

35. We also underestimate how much our unconscious processes, while invisible to us, are often apparent to others. The sender and receiver need not be conscious of the messages they are exchanging or of what is being learned. Parents who have unresolved trauma or conflicts will communicate them to their children. This early learning shapes the brain in a manner that can determine personality, behavior, thoughts, and even belief systems without our awareness.

37. Should we think of our mothers as our first true loves? We are touched, held, kissed, fed, cared for, and rocked to sleep by our mothers. We gaze into their eyes and learn the joy of connection and the pain of separation. Early in life, we learn the smells, sights, touch, and sounds of our mother’s presence, unconsciously associating these experiences with our bodily and emotional states. We all have what has been called an internalized mother, a network of visceral, somatic, and emotional memories of our interactions with our mothers, which are thought to serve as the core of self-esteem, our ability to self-soothe, and the foundation of our adult relationships.

39. Oxytocin stimulates dopamine production and interacts with dopamine to enhance the reward value of a significant other (Liu & Wang, 2003; Shahrokh et al., 2010). Oxytocin also blocks dopamine receptors to prevent habituation to those we love (see Table 8.2). Thus, evolution has used multiple reward systems to keep us focused on staying close and taking care of one another, especially our children.

40. When people find others to be “unrewarding,” they may become more likely to seek out alternative rewards. Money, status, objects, cats and dogs, or even the exquisite suffering involved in self-harm can be conditioned to activate pleasure centers. The problem is, when you depend on a substitute for love, you can never get enough.

41. The idea of being addicted to love may be more than a metaphor. The biochemical systems regulated by relationships are the same as those impacted by cocaine and heroin, and the experiences of craving, dependency, and withdrawal are similar in both romance and addiction.

42. Once the connection between his relationship and drug addiction was made in his mind, we discussed the biochemical processes involved and how the addiction model seemed to fit his situation. “I keep going for the high and ignoring the fact that it’s ruining everything else in my life,” Stan reflected. “There’s no other way I can explain or justify this relationship. It’s going to end badly, and prolonging it is only making it worse.” Still, it was hard. Stan said he felt like his heart was tugged in her direction, and he kept saying to himself, “Just one more night, just one more day.” He would think, “She isn’t really so bad, I can handle this.” Then he would catch himself sounding like an addict in denial and try to get a grip on his feelings. As a part of our renewed work together, he agreed to attend support groups for drug addicts. He found that substituting his girlfriend’s name for whatever substance being discussed was helpful. When he finally did break off the relationship, he discovered that she had already started dating someone else a month earlier. He was devastated when he found out that she had been cheating on him, and it took him many months to get over the physical and emotional pain of her absence. Over months of “detoxification” he gradually felt his heart, mind, and body return to normal. He often described the relationship as an experience that had almost killed him. Stan had been addicted to love.

44. There are two primary categories of remembrance: explicit and implicit memory. Each, in turn, contains a number of subtypes organized by different neural systems. Explicit memory includes sensory, semantic, episodic, narrative, and autobiographical memories. We depend on explicit memory to recognize and remember the faces of familiar others, the rules of etiquette, and the language and stories of our culture.

47. Categories of implicit memory include sensory, emotional, and procedural memories, as well as stimulus-response conditioning (see Table 9.1). Learning how to walk or serve a tennis ball are examples of procedural memories, as are many habitual emotional reactions to social situations, such as tensing up when a stern parent enters the room. Systems of implicit social memory include attachment schemas, instincts, inner objects, transference, and superego.

48. Although most of our important social and emotional lessons occur during our early years, we have little to no conscious memory of learning them. This phenomenon, referred to as infantile amnesia, is due to the immaturity of hippocampal-cortical networks, whose functioning is required for the conscious recollection of the learning process (referred to as source attribution).

54. We are born with immature brains and cling to our mothers long after the umbilical cord is cut. Our mothers and other caretakers are the most salient aspects of our new world, becoming the central axis of our early learning. The first thing we learn about our caretakers is how well they are able to make us feel calm and safe. Their skills as parents will depend on their empathic abilities, their emotional maturity, and how they themselves were parented as children. Because these traits are embedded within implicit social memory and transferred to the same systems in their children, caretaking transmits the childhood experiences of parents to their children. In this way, a parent’s unconscious becomes a child’s first reality. Young brains are not small versions of adult brains, but are optimally designed to react and conform to the behavior of caregivers
   - Location: 2714-2720
   - Page: 177

55. As we learned in the preceding chapter, attachment schemas are a category of implicit social memory shaped by our early experience with caretakers. Our best guess is that these schemas reflect the learning histories that shape experience-dependent networks connecting the orbital frontal, insula, and cingulate cortices with the amygdala, and other regions that regulate arousal, affect, and emotion. It is within these neural networks that interactions with caretakers are paired with feelings of safety and warmth or of anxiety and fear. How attachment schemas are established has widespread ramifications for both our children and their children.

59. Bowlby believed attachment schema to be summations of thousands of experiences with caretakers that become unconscious reflexive predictions of the behaviors of others. These schema become activated in subsequent relationships and lead us to either seek or avoid proximity.
   - Location: 2741-2743
   - Page: 179

60. Attachment schemas are especially apparent under stress because of their central role in affect regulation. These implicit memory schema are obligatory; that is, they are automatically activated before we are even conscious of the people with whom we are about to interact. Schemas shape our conscious experience of others by activating rapid and automatic evaluations hundreds of milliseconds before our perception of others reaches consciousness.

61. The first step for attachment researchers was to develop strategies to reliably measure interactive behaviors. They began by going into the homes of young families to observe the ways in which mothers and children interact in their natural setting. These observations eventually led to the development of four broad categories of mother-child attachment patterns: (1) free/autonomous, (2) dismissing, (3) enmeshed-ambivalent, and (4) disorganized (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Main & Solomon, 1986). Each of these categories describes characteristics of mothers’ behaviors, attitudes, and styles of communication with their children. The free/autonomous mothers were available, perceptive, and sensitive to their children’s feelings and needs. These mothers were seen as effective in their interactions with their children. Dismissing mothers were rated as unavailable, rejecting, and distant. Ambivalent mothers demonstrated inconsistent availability that fluctuated with overinvolvement with their children. Mothers in the disorganized category appeared to create conflict and often seemed both frightened by, and frightening to, their children. Many of these mothers were subsequently shown to be suffering from trauma, unresolved grief, or both.

64. We have learned a great deal from attachment research: how our primitive bonding instincts regulate anxiety, how categories of attachment reflect a parent’s behavior and a child’s reaction to stress, and how attachment schema are carried into adulthood, affecting our choice of partners, the nature of our relationships, and the way we parent our own children.

65. An understanding of implicit social memory, attachment schema, and how they impact our experience of one another is an important tool in psychotherapy. Knowledge of these unconscious processes provides a language and logic with which to discuss thoughts and feelings that are automatic, overwhelming, and destructive of intimacy. It also helps us understand the importance of consistent caretaking, emotional availability, and self-insight in raising our children.

Although infinite subtleties of facial expressions are possible, and each culture has its own unique facial idioms, there appear to be a group of facial expressions that are universal to all people regardless of age, gender, or culture (Ekman, 2003).

It turns out that we don’t just read facial expressions; we read the expressions, gestures, and actions of the entire body (Decety & Grèzes, 1999).

83. The medial parietal area is a central structure for self-representation, self-monitoring, and a state of resting consciousness (Lou et al., 2004). Damage at the junction of the parietal and temporal lobes correlates with out-of-body experiences and a variety of other disturbances of identity and self (Blank & Arzy, 2005). There is also evidence to suggest that the parietal lobes participate in the creation of internal representations of the actions of others within us (Shmuelof & Zohary, 2006). In other words, we internalize others by creating representations of them in our imaginations. This allows us to both learn from others and carry them with us when they are absent. These inner “objects,” as described by psychoanalysis, likely serve as the infrastructure of the construction and maintenance of our ongoing experience of self and others

86. In its most basic form, attachment is a navigation strategy that is accomplished via the regulation of positive and negative bodily states through proximity with others. It accomplishes this by linking good feelings with proximity to good attachment figures (oxytocin/dopamine/serotonin), and bad feelings with separation from them or the approach of a threat.

However, given that they exist in primitive animals and infants, it might be more helpful (and perhaps more accurate) to think of attachment patterns as sensory-motor memories related to approach-avoidance learning. Another way to describe this is motor cognition, a way to understand both the evolution and the development of how we come to learn from and about others through observation and internal simulation (Gallese et al., 2009). Thus, attachment schema are not just cognitive-emotional constructs; rather they are wired into our bodies and become manifest in our musculature, posture, gait, and interpersonal stance.

89. to perceive is also to construct the current situation based on past learning. Affordance is an important aspect of this construction, the preparation to respond with sensory, motor, and emotional programs tailored to a particular situation. When we know how to engage in a pattern of behavior or use a tool, not only is our procedural memory activated for such use, but the tool becomes incorporated into our body schema, uniting our actions and the tools we use with our somatic experience of self

91. Resonance behaviors stimulated via mirror systems are reflexive, implicit, and obligatory responses. They communicate information, advance social cohesion, and enhance group safety. Resonance behaviors also serve learning by providing an automatic core for imitative learning and the organization of procedural memory (Rizzolatti et al., 1999).

92. Many people are especially sensitive to the emotional states of others and are highly tuned to the subtleties of conscious and unconscious social communication. This is often true for individuals who grow up with emotionally unpredictable or dangerous parents, causing the former to have to respond preemptively to avoid harm. Some people develop such extreme sensitivity to others that they have great difficulties being in a relationship and maintaining their sense of individuality. Still others become so good at “mind reading” that they come to believe that they are clairvoyant or possess other paranormal abilities. Clients

93. When mothers are asked to sing to their infants, attuned mothers will sing less playfully to a distressed child, more closely matching the child’s affective state. Mothers with dismissing attachment do not adjust in this way (Milligan et al., 2003). A mother’s emotional state has been found to transfer to her children early in life (Haviland & Lelwica, 1987). The ability to access and use resonance behaviors in parenting will likely correlate with the security of attachment relationships. Emotional resonance between mother and child correlates later with spending more time in social engagement, affect regulation, and the child’s ability to comment on his or her feelings and inner experience. It also correlates with children’s ability to engage in symbolic play and their attained level of verbal IQ

96. According to the psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut, empathy is an attempt to experience the inner life of another while retaining objectivity. In other words, we hold our own perspective in mind while simultaneously imagining what it is like to be the other. In order to have empathy, we need to maintain an awareness of our inner world as we imagine the inner world of others. Shuttling back and forth between my head and what I imagine to be in yours, I generate hypotheses about your inner state based on my own thoughts and inner experiences. This process is at the core of the therapeutic relationship. When boundaries become blurred and resonance experiences are assumed to be identical to the inner state of the other, empathy is replaced by identification or fusion. This primitive and often pathological state is not considered to be empathy because it lacks perspective and an awareness of boundaries.

97. This network of physical pain has been conserved and utilized for socially painful experiences like rejection, exclusion, and shame (Eisenberger et al., 2006; Eisenberger & Lieberman, 2004). Because of this, it shouldn’t be surprising that acetaminophen has been shown to decrease the brain’s reaction to social rejection while oxytocin diminishes our experience of physical pain

98. When we judge things to be morally good or physically attractive, the OMPFC increases in activation, while the insula decreases in activation (Tsukiura & Cabeza, 2011). Given that insula activation correlates with so many negative emotional experiences, such as disgust and suffocation, there may be a reciprocal sense of safety, well-being, and reward in the face of both beauty and moral virtue. This commonality may explain why we tend to think of people who are attractive as possessing moral virtue and other positive qualities.

105. One of the most dramatic demonstrations of the power of sociostatic regulation is what happens to us when we lose someone close to us. The depths of emotional, physical, and spiritual devastation we can experience leaves little doubt that our brains are social organs linked across the social synapse. We can see by looking at other animals that the experience of loss is not uniquely human. After the death of a child, primate mothers and others in the troop will show a series of approaches and retreats from the body. Primate mothers will continue to care for the corpse of their infant, sleep with it, and show distress when they are separated from it. Some primate mothers and other females have also been observed to continue carrying and grooming infants for weeks and even months after their deaths

108. memory of the lost loved one continues to stimulate reward circuitry, reinforcing the continuation of grief (O’Connor et al., 2008). Thus, prolonged grief in some individuals may be a successful attempt to hold on to the loved one and continue to gain pleasure from the sustained attachment. This may be why successful grieving includes new ways of seeing life and establishing new forms of satisfaction and reward.

109. While a regular dose of voluntary solitude can make an important contribution to emotional balance and self-awareness, imposed isolation can be painful, debilitating, and even worse. Isolation, loneliness, and depression have been shown to have a synergistic effect in diminishing well-being that results in reduced autonomic regulation, cardiac health, and immunological functioning

110. The grief experienced for the loss of companion animals demonstrates similar biological and psychological processes activated by our relationships with humans. It also highlights the potential value of using animals in therapeutic situations to support trust and attachment, especially when the difficulties are tied to feelings of abuse and abandonment at the hands of significant others. Many people who are unable to connect with other people are able to attach to animals. After all, pets have an advantage over people in that they are generally not seen as evaluative and critical. The love, attention, and affection received from pets are generally experienced as unconditional, allowing those with social anxiety, a core sense of shame, or betrayal trauma to bond with and attach to animals.

112. While research has certainly made the case for the benefits of positive relationships, it has also consistently demonstrated that it is bad for us to be in negative relationships. Considerable evidence supports the notion that unhappy marriages result in higher levels of stress hormones and suppressed immunological functioning than isolation, especially in women (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1987). Although broad social support and close relationships are just about always good, critical and hostile others can be terrible for our health

118. The importance of the mother’s expressive face is nowhere more apparent than in what has been called “still-face” research. In this paradigm the mother shifts from interacting with her infant to a blank expression for a period of time before resuming normal interactions. In research in which nondepressed mothers assumed a still-face, 3-month-olds quickly reacted with wariness and protest (Cohn & Tronick, 1983, 1989); 6-month-old infants reacted with negative affect, a drop in vagal tone, and an increase in heart rate (Gusella et al., 1988; Weinberg & Tronick, 1996). After the resumption of normal facial expressions by the mothers, there was an increase in fussiness and crying. Even under normal conditions, a flat, withdrawn maternal expression is associated with distress in the infant (Cohn

119. Depression disrupts the ability of the mother-child pair to form optimal attunement, which, in turn, impacts the child’s ability to develop adequate internal emotional regulation and states of interpersonal synchrony (Tronick & Weinberg, 1997; Weinberg & Tronick, 1998). An additional danger is that maternal depression will evoke caretaking behaviors in the child, creating a reversal of the mirroring process

120. The work of Meaney and others has provided us with ample evidence that mother rats pass on their genes through DNA and shape genetic expression through their behavior. Environmental programming is a term used to describe this orchestration of epigenetic factors during development

122. Genetic expression is programmed by experience through the alteration of the chromatin structure and the methylation of DNA (Szyf at al., 2007). In effect, the genome is like a keyboard, while these processes select the notes to be played. Methylation is a process by which a methyl group is added to DNA. This has been shown to be a reversible but stable modification to DNA that is passed along to daughter cells and can lead to long-term gene silencing. Low licking/grooming mothering results in increased glucocorticoid receptor methylation, decreased glucocorticoid receptor expression, and an increased stress response. Licking/grooming decreases methylation, increases GR expression, and down-regulates the stress response

125. Positive maternal attention impacts the brain in two very important ways. First, it decreases the impact of subsequent stress on the brain. By generating more cortisol receptors in many regions of the brain, it creates a kind of biochemical buffer to future challenges. Second, it enhances brain growth and the development of brain systems that support attachment, affect regulation, and problem solving

126. Good parenting tells the child he or she is loved, accepted, and valued, fortifies the body for growth, and strengthens immunological functioning. From an evolutionary perspective, being touched (or licked, if you’re a rat) tells the brain that you are part of the group, that you are safe, and to live long and prosper!

127. prolonged stress inhibits protein production in order to maintain higher levels of metabolism. Proteins are, of course, the building blocks of the immunological system (e.g., leukocytes, B cells, T cells, natural killer cells), and the inhibition of protein synthesis also suppresses the ability of the body to fight off infection and illness. This mechanism is one of the primary reasons for the high correlation between prolonged stress and disease

128. sustained higher levels of metabolism continue to pump sodium into neurons, eventually overwhelming the ability of cells to transport it out again, resulting in destruction of the cell membrane and cell death. This process has been found to be particularly damaging to cells within the hippocampus, leading to a variety of memory deficits.

132. Our brains rely on other brains to remain healthy, especially when we are under stress. When faced with illness, catastrophe, or loss, we turn to each other for comfort, security, and stability. Resiliency—our ability to cope with life’s ups and downs—is closely tied to the extent and quality of our support systems. We appear to be capable of coping with just about anything when we are able to stay connected to those for whom we care and who care for us.

133. Humans are born brimming over with primitive, uncivilized, animalistic instincts. They expect to be the center of attention, win all the prizes, and be rewarded no matter what they do. They want to fly like a superhero, win every game they play, and never have to share with others. What awaits them are parents who want a respectful, hardworking, and well-behaved child. If all goes well in the ensuing 2-decade battle, a child’s primitive narcissistic instincts will gradually be shaped into healthy self-esteem. If things don’t go well, a child can enter adolescence with a profound sense of core shame.

135. The quality and amount of maternal care, handling, and soothing touch stimulate the creation of GC receptors, allowing the hippocampus to down-regulate GC exposure through greater feedback to the adrenal glands (Meaney et al., 1989; Plotsky & Meaney, 1993). The result is a decreased reaction to subsequent stress and greater protection of the hippocampus. If this is the case, one of the most important biological effects of secure attachment would be to protect the hippocampus from stress.

The hippocampus is necessary for the consolidation and contextualization of new episodic, sequential, and autobiographical learning (Eichenbaum, 1992; Ross et al., 2009; Squire, 1987).

138. Whereas the hippocampus is required for the conscious memory of the experience, the amygdala is necessary for the visceral response to fear (Williams, Phillips, et al., 2001). The sight of a dog that once bit you might elicit a bodily fear response via the amygdala, but hippocampal damage would leave you without conscious memory of why you were afraid.

139. The relationship between the amygdala and hippocampus is extremely important to human experience and contributes significantly to top-down and left-right integration. The participation of the amygdala is biased toward both right and down systems, whereas the hippocampus plays a large role in left and top processing. Put another way, the amygdala has a central role in the emotional and somatic organization of experience, whereas the hippocampus is vital for conscious, logical, and cooperative social functioning

142. Anxiety and fear are the conscious aspects of our body’s ongoing appraisal of danger. They can be triggered by countless conscious or unconscious cues, and they have the power to shape our thoughts, behavior, and feelings. At their most adaptive, anxiety and fear encourage us to step back from the edge of a cliff, cross the street when unsavory characters are coming our way, or check to see if we signed our tax forms before sealing the envelope. At their least adaptive, they prevent us from taking appropriate risks, engaging in potentially beneficial relationships, and exploring our world.

143. Keep in mind that what triggers social anxiety is not a direct threat to our physical survival. Rather, it is usually related to the anticipation of shame, the social correlate of physical danger. For infants, shame is an emotional disconnection with caretakers that is experienced as a threat to survival. The automatic and unconscious activation of shame continues to shape our self-image and social behavior into adulthood. For some, coping with shame and the anxiety it evokes is a crippling and lifelong struggle.

145. Human history is plagued by examples of prejudice, racism, and genocide. In fact, the ubiquity of prejudice and racism seems to suggest that we are hardwired to dislike, distrust, and even hate those who are different from us.

Thus, being the victim of prejudice creates a powerful inner disadvantage for children with darker skin, even among their own communities (Sidanius et al., 2001).

Greater conservatism is associated with increased volume in the right amygdala (Kanai et al., 2011). Conservatives demonstrate more amygdala activation and persistent cognitive styles compared with liberals, who demonstrate more sensitivity for cues to alternate responses. Along with these differences in cognitive style, greater liberalism was associated with stronger conflict-related anterior cingulate activity

151. Of concern for those in professions such as medicine, mental health, and law enforcement is that racial bias decreases emotional attunement and sensitivity to the pain of others (Avenanti et al. 2010).

153. Conscious processing is directly involved with the inhibition and control of automatic implicit processing. So when same-race faces are presented for 500 milliseconds, or the time it takes to be consciously aware of what is being presented, amygdala activation is reduced, while frontal activation increases (Cunningham et al., 2004). In other words, people with low levels of stereotyping have learned to inhibit their automatic responses and replace them with thoughts more reflective of equality. Via conscious effort, positive experiences, or consistent exposure, they have created an important break between reflexive prejudice and conscious thoughts and behaviors

158. what happens between parents and children countless times during childhood: cycles of regulation, dysregulation, and reregulation. During this process, parents and therapists serve as external prefrontal lobes, assisting in the moment-to-moment navigation of life’s emotional ups and downs. Successfully repeating this process hundreds of times creates an unconscious expectation of positive outcomes and effective regulation. In this regard, therapy is an attempt to build new regulatory circuitry later in life when it was not established early on. This is “a memory for the future,” a pattern that contains the full-body memory that “I can survive these feelings” and that reregulation is “just around the corner.” This positive background affect allows us to feel that the glass is half full, to have the confidence to take risks, and to stay on course when things don’t go our way.

As we all know, borderline individuals have deficits in both the emotional and the cognitive aspects of empathy and demonstrate abnormal functioning in right insula and left STS during empathy tasks (Dziobek et al., 2011).

162. One of the most fundamental emotional realities for the borderline client is a sense of profound shame. Shame, as discussed in the previous chapter, is the experience of the self as defective, bad, and worthy of rejection. This feeling is almost never based on recalled behavior but rather on a bodily intuition that is more felt than thought.

163. Many people with borderline personality disorder are exceptionally conscientious, are careful to abide by the law, and keep their agreements with others to a fault. It seems that as children, however, they experienced themselves as objects of disgust, an emotion that becomes a core sense of self. To become aware of the self for a borderline patient is to feel repulsive and unlovable. When these patients look within, all they feel is pain. To feel is to feel badly about the self.

164. Some kids don’t play fair! They tell lies, cheat at games, and play too rough. These kids have trouble at home and trouble at school and gravitate toward kids with similar problems. Unfazed by rules, they challenge authority at every opportunity and seem incapable of engaging in positive relationships and prosocial behavior.

Still, we must be careful not to use too broad a brush: Often, from the harshest, most deprived, and most abusive homes come the most tender and loving people. On the other hand—and to the heartbreak of those closest to them—the cruelest people sometimes can come from loving homes.

166. Antisocial individuals, on the other hand, are a society of one who adhere to the more primitive mandate of individual survival. It is as if they have passed over the eons of social evolution that have selected cooperation, emotional attunement, and being part of a group mind. While thinkers such as Nietzsche, Machiavelli, and Rand have extolled the virtues of the Übermensch (superman) and society even lionizes those who gain prominence and success, selfish behavior has not proved to be a successful overall strategy for group survival. For humans and other social animals, noncooperation and a sole focus on personal survival does not correlate with evolutionary success.

167. The current symptoms of APD read like a description of a bad citizen and the things every parent tries to train out of their children: •Failure to conform to social norms, the law, or work requirements •Deceitfulness •Lack of empathy •Lack of remorse for actions that have harmed others •Impulsive behavior and lack of foresight •Aggressiveness and irritability •Reckless disregard for the safety of self and others

168. Antisocial patients do have a theory of mind of the other, but instead of using it to connect, they use it to manipulate others to get their way. Their lack of empathy allows them to objectify and use others for their own needs, unimpaired by an awareness of the suffering of their victims.

169. Frontal damage, especially on the right side, often deprives its victims of a sense of humor and the ability to comprehend jokes (Goel & Dolan, 2001; Shammi & Stuss, 1999). To “get” a joke we have to both appreciate the juxtaposition of information and get an emotional jolt from our reward system.
   - Location: 6522-6524
   - Page: 426

170. The role of humor is vast in social functioning: We enjoy laughing and making others laugh, and we inject all sorts of chuckles and smiles while we interact. Laughter in conversation, in the absence of anything funny, greases the wheels of social communication and tells others that we are safe to relax with and to let our guard down.

171. When subjects were shown pictures of their loved ones, areas of the brain with heightened activation included the insula, anterior cingulate, caudate nucleus, and putamen. Subjects showed decreased activation in the amygdala, posterior cingulate, and the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices on the right side (Bartels & Zeki, 2000). This study suggests that the experience of love is a combination of at least two processes. The first is that it greatly decreases activation of the fear systems, as demonstrated by the “standing down” of the amygdala and the environmental processing of the posterior cingulate and other cortical areas. Love is a relief from scanning the outer world for threat and our inner worlds for shame. Love turns off the alarm, cancels our insurance, and frees us from worry.

172. The state of being in love makes us happy by activating the brain’s reward systems. The sight, smell, and touch of our beloved make us glad to be alive. Love is a drug—in fact, a number of drugs (including endorphins and dopamine) resulting in similar patterns of brain activation as seen in taking cocaine (Breiter et al., 1997; Schlaepfer et al., 1998). This parallel between the feeling of being in love and addiction may help those of us who have not taken drugs to understand their addictive qualities. Imagine being able to simulate the experience of falling in love at will and you can begin to grasp the addictive power of drugs. On the other hand, cocaine addicts have been found to have smaller frontal, cingulate, and insular cortices (Franklin et al., 2002). This shrinkage may be a result of drug use, or it may represent an inherent vulnerability to drug abuse. Given that these cortical regions are central to bonding and attachment, cocaine may provide a feeling that the addict’s brain is unable to generate from relationships.

173. Based on the way our brains operate, evolution appears to have been far more interested in keeping us alive than in making us happy. Overall, negative emotions trump positive ones and weigh more heavily in our evaluation of people and situations (Ito et al., 2002). Being in a car accident, having a gun put to our head, or even seeing someone else seriously injured or killed can brand our memory. In a single highly charged affective moment, any of us can learn to be terrified of something for the rest of our lives. On the other hand, learning not to be afraid can take months or even years of reconditioning.

174. Extinction research with animals is teaching us that whereas calcium plays a role in short-term extinction, long-term extinction requires gene expression and protein synthesis. This means that the structure and connectivity of neurons needs to be modified before we can learn not to fear. This finding is supported by research showing that the introduction into the amygdala of chemicals that promote neuroplastic changes facilitates extinction
   - Location: 7619-7622
   - Page: 497

175. The implication of this research is that extinguishing fear involves structural changes in the amygdala and that therapies may have enhanced efficacy when paired with the administration of neurochemicals that promote the growth of new structures—and, hence, new learning. Although we now know that learning

176. One method of learning not to fear is allowing yourself to be exposed to a feared stimulus and not running away or dissociating it from consciousness. Your grandfather may have called it “getting back up on the horse that threw you” (LeDoux & Gorman, 2001). Cognitive therapists call it exposure, relaxation training, and response prevention. Gestalt therapists call it the “safe emergency” of psychotherapy. Parents do it while holding their distressed child and telling him or her that everything will be okay. Teachers break down complex tasks into manageable parts and encourage their students along the way. All these “interventions” combine a relationship, moderate levels of arousal, thinking, feeling, and a story repeated over and over again. The repetition of this process encourages the reshaping and integration of neural circuits for emotional regulation and learning.

178. Healthy relationships, life challenges, loss, and personal growth seem capable of reshaping the circuits of the social brain in both positive and negative ways.
   - Location: 7647-7648

179. Attachment research has demonstrated that children who do not have safe and secure relationships with their parents can grow up to have secure attachment relationships as adults and, in turn, provide secure attachment for their own children. These individuals are considered to have accomplished what is called earned autonomy. Somehow, they have found a way to learn how to cognitively and emotionally process negative experiences with their parents, find others with whom to connect, and regulate their inner emotional worlds. This is certainly an example of neural plasticity within the networks of the social brain. Individuals who have accomplished earned autonomy often report finding someone who was able to make them feel cared for and important and provided them with a feeling of safety. They found someone who was curious and interested in their thoughts and feelings. Often it was a passion for some shared interest that connected them and provided a sense of belonging and accomplishment.

183. A consistent theme of adult psychotherapy clients is that they had parents who were not curious about who they were but, instead, told them who they should be. This parenting stance often results in a child who creates a persona for the world but lacks self-knowledge.

185. turns out that the memories contained in our stories are also evolving. Memory is not a hard drive full of fixed data; it consists of countless stories that are told, reorganized, and re-created with each telling. Each time a memory is accessed, it can be modified by new experiences that increase its relevance to current conditions (Duvarci & Nader, 2004; Nader, 2003). The upside is that difficult or confusing memories can be restructured. Revisiting and revising the past (and related thoughts and beliefs) are central components of dynamic, cognitive, and systems therapies.

186. Secure parents share information about their internal states and ask their children about what’s on their minds. These discussions provide scaffolding for cognitive processing, emotional regulation, and an ability to think more objectively about our experiences.

187. Secure attachment, the inclusion of internal states in discussions, even a parent’s curiosity about what his or her child feels—all stimulate the development and connectivity of neural networks throughout the brain. This integration may allow for an increased consciousness of internal states, better emotional regulation, and an improved ability to attain shared states of consciousness.

It is a psychological buffer: the capital is not so large as to make you spoiled-rich, but large enough to give you the freedom to choose a new occupation without excessive consideration of the financial rewards. It shields you from prostituting your mind and frees you from outside authority—any outside authority.

8. In the arts—say the cinema—things are far more vicious. What we call “talent” generally comes from success, rather than its opposite. A great deal of empiricism has been done on the subject, most notably by Art De Vany, an insightful and original thinker who singlemindedly studied wild uncertainty in the movies. He showed that, sadly, much of what we ascribe to skills is an after-the-fact attribution. The movie makes the actor, he claims—and a large dose of nonlinear luck makes the movie. The success of movies depends severely on contagions. Such contagions do not just apply to the movies: they seem to affect a wide range of cultural products. It is hard for us to accept that people do not fall in love with works of art only for their own sake, but also in order to feel that they belong to a community. By imitating, we get closer to others—that is, other imitators. It fights solitude.

2. Crowded cities, unsafe and unsanitary working conditions, long working hours, and the use of children as laborers were among the prominent harmful features of the Industrial Revolution’s techstorm.

Often the destructive impact of a new technology precedes the reaping of its benefits.

3. Complex systems are by their very nature unpredictable, and prone to all sorts of mishaps when met with unanticipated events. Even very well designed complex systems periodically act in ways that cannot be anticipated. Events that have a low probability of occurring are commonly overlooked and not planned for, but they do happen.

6. chaos science or chaos theory looks at how the activity of components of a system can lead to dynamically rich but seemingly random behavior while following simple physical laws. Complexity science studies the dynamic behavior of interactions between large numbers of components or units within a system. In a chaotic system, the individual elements need not affect the behavior of other elements in any discernible way. In contrast, the nodes, components, or individuals in a complex system are coupled and adapt to each other’s behavior.

   - Location: 774-774
   - Page: 51

11. Sometimes accidents occur even when no one does anything wrong; these constitute the third reason for system failures. Charles Perrow named these events normal accidents. Perrow considers the 1979 partial nuclear meltdown and release of radioactive material at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania a classic example of a normal accident. The disaster was caused by three different components failing at the same time. While the reactor’s designers had planned for the failure of each of these components, they did not, and probably could not, have anticipated the simultaneous failure of all three.

12. the fourth way complex systems fail. Often the probability of some untoward event has been underestimated and therefore no advanced planning was in place for its occurrence. Such events are called black swans because if you see a black swan you are likely to be surprised. Nassim Taleb, a Lebanese-American statistician and best-selling author, has championed the black swan theory as a way of highlighting why people are blind to the inevitability of low-probability events, and why these events, when they occur, are likely to have a broad impact.

14. First, the human body is remarkably adaptive, robust, and resilient. Understanding why humans, and indeed all organisms, are so resilient can inspire scientists and engineers to develop similar mechanisms to improve the adaptive capabilities of non-biological technologies. Second, many of the complex technologies under development entail interventions into biological processes for therapeutic purposes or to enhance capabilities. As all good doctors know, intervening in the functioning of the human body must be done carefully, and can be dangerous and unpredictable. Finally, the complexity of the human body will thwart the full and easy realization of some of the more highly touted technological aspirations such as personalized medicine and selecting a significant number of features for infants before they are born.

Of the two trillion dollars a year spent on health care in the U.S., only 10 percent is spent on drugs, 2 percent is spent on diagnostic tests, and roughly 85 percent goes to taking care of those who are sick and the administration of health care.

18. I am a friendly skeptic regarding the prospect of research in artificial intelligence leading to a technological singularity—also referred to as the advent of super-intelligence. I am friendly to the can-do engineering spirit that proposes to build machines with enough general intelligence to perform a vast array of tasks. But I am deeply skeptical that we know enough about the nature of intelligence or consciousness to replicate these capabilities in silicon or any other material. Certain qualities of human intelligence emerge in biological systems in ways that we do not comprehend and which will require scientific insights that we have not even begun to formulate. The integration of the human mind with the body, and its adaptive resilience in responding to changes in the environment in which it is embodied, will be hard to duplicate through any non-biological means. I am somewhat friendlier to the notion that super-intelligence could eventually be produced by combining human brainpower with advanced forms of artificial intelligence.

The vast preponderance of people will throw a switch to save the life of five workers from an approaching train, even if their action will certainly kill a worker on the alternate track, who would not have otherwise died.

25. In the lowly Aplysia, memory creation is the result of complex molecular, synaptic, and gene interactions. Short-term memories, Kandel discovered, are produced by alterations in proteins that strengthen the synaptic connections between neurons. Further stimulation can lead to the creation of new synapses. What is particularly interesting about Kandel’s research for our purposes is the role genes play in the encoding of long-term memories. There are biochemical inhibitions on the creation of long-term memories. That is the reason we do not create long-term memories for everything we learn. But once these inhibitors are overridden, learning and memory are processes that alter the very structure of neurons by activating genes in the nucleus of the neuronal cell to grow new synapses that connect to other neurons. For the marine slug Aplysia, sustained stimulation can increase the synapses on a neuron from twelve hundred to twenty-six hundred.

26. In the new paradigm, anything that is not a gene is in the gene’s environment. Outside of the cell DNA is an inert molecule. Its expression is stimulated by many factors including the nutritional content of the cell in which the genetic material is located. Individual genes can be activated, suppressed, and even altered by not only the diverse set of molecules in the cell, but also by other genetic information in the chromosome. In turn, the expression of genes will alter the cell, the organism, and (eventually) the ecosystem in which the organism is active.

In the 1930 essay Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, he wrote that “we are being afflicted with a new disease . . . namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.” With these words, Keynes captured a recurring fear that has gripped workers since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.

But capital growth will mean very little to the average citizen, when 70 percent of stock ownership is held by 5 percent of the population, and more than half of the American public owns no stocks. David Rose, a technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist who has founded or funded more than eighty companies, believes that the exponential growth of technological development has put us on the road to a world without work and perhaps even a world with very few companies. If they are right, and capital grows dramatically, and if governments intervene to distribute that capital with even a modest degree of fairness, a utopian future is at least conceivable.

Both victories were truly noteworthy, and yet each revealed new layers of complexity that must

32. The advent of the first Ohio-class submarines armed with Trident missiles in 1988 functioned as a tipping point that destabilized the Cold War. The Trident significantly shortened the time between launch and strike, which was advantageous if the U.S. intended to strike the Soviet Union first, but a serious disadvantage in that it undermined the time for the Soviets to determine whether a strike was actually occurring or a false alarm. There would be little or no opportunity for Soviet leaders to be brought into the decision-making process. The likelihood rose of a nuclear war being started because of a reactive response to false data. By the 1990s, the future of humanity became dependent on the state of Soviet computer technology, sensors, and warning systems. In retrospect, it was revealed that these systems were seriously deficient.

37. A Czech playwright, Karel Čapek, coined the term “robot” for his 1920 play R.U.R., in which a rebellion by initially happy slave androids leads to the extinction of humans. Čapek’s robots, like the golems of Jewish folklore, were inanimate matter that somehow became anthropomorphic beings.

38. The increasing use of “robonannies” in some Asian countries to tend infants and children raises serious concerns. Computing scholars Noel and Amanda Sharkey propose that the extended use of robots as nannies may actually stunt an infant’s emotional and intellectual development, because the robot will fail to provide the kind of rich verbal and nonverbal interaction human caregivers offer. Robot toys and companions cannot interact with their charges in the same way a human companion would, which forces manufacturers to consider how to design the systems to respond appropriately in ethically significant situations.
   - Location: 4153-4158

39. The appropriateness and ability of robots to serve as caregivers is commonly misunderstood by the public or misrepresented by those marketing the systems. The limited abilities of present-day robotic devices can be obscured by the human tendency to anthropomorphize a robot whose looks or behavior faintly mimic that of a human.

40. Diagnoses and prognoses by computers that demonstrate a high degree of accuracy threaten to replace the judgment of even gifted physicians. While these systems are marketed as adjuncts to the judgments of doctors, in some situations they can dilute the authority of physicians who have traditionally been considered responsible for quality medical care.
   - Location: 4211-4214
   - Page: 275

41. Even though a disease can often be treated appropriately through a computerized diagnosis, we should never forget that it is a person’s fate that is being decided by the algorithmic analysis of numbers. Within the field of medicine, a vigorous debate has ensued over the proper role for computerized diagnoses and treatment plans. Over the long run, statistics may indeed tell the story. If computers are better than doctors in diagnosing most diseases and recommending successful courses of treatment, then so be it. Improving quality of life for patients and the efficiency of health care will be served. But we don’t have that certainty yet. And in the meantime, there remains an undying belief that those uniquely human skills—experience, intuition, a sixth sense, and knowledge of factors the computer might not have considered—will prevail over raw numbers.

42. acknowledge that the systems are not always correct. The challenge for hospital administrators lies in maintaining room for human judgment to prevail over algorithmic analysis. Unfortunately, in a litigious age, doctors may feel uncomfortable going against the recommendations of semi-intelligent systems, particularly when an audit trail noting the advice produced by the software will be available to enterprising lawyers.

43. Driverless cars, service robots, and medical diagnostic programs all illustrate different ways in which smart or increasingly autonomous computer systems can dilute human responsibility and, ultimately, human control. The stakes and social ramifications of going down this road are high and overshadow the desirability or benefits that might be accrued from each of the individual technologies. In none of these three instances, however, are the risks comparable to the introduction of lethal autonomous robots (LARs). And yet, together with LARs, all of these technologies share the prospect that human responsibility and authority can be undermined if we fail to be careful about which forms of artificial intelligence we adopt and how we implement them.

45. When the manufacturers or the people working with an intelligent machine cannot know how it will act in unfamiliar situations and something harmful happens, who is responsible? The manufacturers will continue to be responsible for most situations, but perhaps not all accidents. In the distant future, it might be possible to build conscious software agents capable of making sophisticated and sensitive choices and knowing what they are doing. In the meantime, holding the machine responsible for its actions is nonsense. Insurance companies could elect to sell no-fault coverage to shield either manufacturers or users from situations where a robot’s actions surprise everyone, presuming that such incidents are truly outliers. But, as discussed, allowing people and corporations to abrogate their responsibility is a bad idea that opens the door to the creation of potentially dangerous computing devices. Any commonsense approach to safety requires that a person or corporation be held responsible for all harms caused by a technology.

46. a service robot may need to decide whether to recharge its battery before or after performing a series of tasks such as delivering medication or the newspaper to the individual it assists. Perhaps the tasks are prioritized and those priorities change according to the time of day, the health of the individual, or other factors. Robots capable of making ethical determinations are functionally moral even if they have little or no actual understanding of the tasks they perform.

47. Isaac Asimov’s (1920–1992) Three Laws of Robots. In a collection of science fiction novels and stories, Asimov proposed that all robots be programmed with these laws: 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Later, he added a Zeroth Law: A robot may not harm humanity, or allow humanity to come to harm. The Three Laws are straightforward and arranged hierarchically. Nevertheless, in story after story, Asimov illustrates how difficult it would be to design robots that followed these simple ethical rules. For example, a robot programmed with just the three laws will not know what to do when confronted with conflicting orders from two different people.

49. Theorists note the feedback loop between high-speed technologies, the accelerated rate of social transformation, and the ever-increasing pace of daily life. They perceive speeding up as a characteristic of modernity and of capitalism. Capitalism’s demand for increased productivity and efficiency makes it the predominant driver of acceleration. The sped-up pace of work and daily life increases productivity, but in the contemporary economic climate, it has not led to quality of life improvements such as wage growth for the average citizen. Furthermore, speed actually undermines productivity when, for example, an accelerating pace accompanied by poor oversight leads to a disruptive crisis,
   - Location: 4820-4825
   - Page: 315

50. Too much speed not only places a burden on economic systems; it also undermines democratic institutions. Increasing numbers of problems go unsolved. A heady pace of change makes everything a crisis. A “state of emergency” becomes the normal state of affairs. When a society is in a state of permanent crisis, there will always be justifications and rationalizations for expediency in the form of careless policies.

52. Finally, the accelerating pace undermines the quality of each of our lives. Some individuals find pressure to keep pace exhilarating. Increasingly, however, the crescendo in the chorus of complaints about stress from having more on one’s platter than can be managed effectively, has risen to a deafening pitch. Time-saving gadgets don’t help when one must learn how to use hundreds of individual features. Stress leads to sleep disorders, disease, and a sense that one’s life is out of control. An analysis such as this can be dismissed as unwarranted doom and gloom, or as a call for creative vigilance in the oversight of technological development. The latter motivated me to write this book.

53. In Europe and the U.S., a new model for determining the priorities of an informed electorate is under development. The consensus conference or citizen panel allows a representative cross-section of citizens to tap into the knowledge of experts, but then independently formulate their own opinions. In the 1980s, Denmark was the first country to experiment with forums that enable representative citizens to study and report on issues of importance, such as nanotechnology. More recent experiments in other countries have adapted this approach for studying what does and what does not concern the public in the adoption of new technologies.

54. The broader electorate may or may not be willing to defer to the judgment of a citizen panel on serious issues, such as the acceptability of releasing synthetic organisms into the environment or the adoption of new designs for nuclear power plants. With some public education, however, the citizen panel might be perceived as a viable alternative to relying solely upon the views of politicians, experts, and vested interests.

## The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge
**Author:** Matt Ridley

### Highlights (5)

1. So, for example, in my lifetime, disapproval of homosexuality has become ever more morally unacceptable in the West, while disapproval of paedophilia has become ever more morally mandatory. Male celebrities who broke the rules with under-age girls long ago and thought little of it now find themselves in court and in disgrace; while others who broke the (then) rules with adult men long ago and risked disgrace can now openly speak of their love. Don’t get me wrong: I approve of both these trends – but that’s not my point. My point is that the changes did not come about because some moral leader or committee ordained them, at least not mainly, let alone that some biblical instruction to make the changes came to light. Rather, the moral negotiation among ordinary people gradually changed the common views in society, with moral teachers reflecting the changes along the way. Morality, quite literally, evolved.
   - Location: 375-381
   - Page: 25

2. At the end of the nineteenth century, the German biologist August Weismann pointed out a huge problem with Lamarckism: the separation of germ-line cells (the ones that end up being eggs or sperm) from other body cells early in the life of an animal makes it virtually impossible for information to feed back from what happens to a body during its life into its very recipe. Since the germ cells were not an organism in microcosm, the message telling them to adopt an acquired character must, Weismann argued, be of an entirely different nature from the change itself. Changing a cake after it has been baked cannot alter the recipe that was used.

3. In fact, there is a way for acquired characteristics to come to be incorporated into genetic inheritance, but it takes many generations and it is blindly Darwinian. It goes by the name of the Baldwin effect. A species that over many generations repeatedly exposes itself to some experience will eventually find its offspring selected for a genetic predisposition to cope with that experience.

4. Life consists of the capacity to reverse the drift towards entropy and disorder, at least locally – to use information to make local order from chaos while expending energy. Essential to these three skills are three kinds of molecule in particular – DNA for storing information, protein for making order, and ATP as the medium of energy exchange.

5. Compared with animals, plants dare not rely on brain-directed behaviour, because they cannot run away from grazers, and if a grazer ate the brain, it would mean death. So plants can withstand almost any loss, and regenerate easily. They are utterly decentralised.

## Everyone's a Winner: Life in Our Congratulatory Culture
**Author:** Joel Best

### Highlights (17)

1. The great German sociologist Max Weber argued that societies rank their members along economic, political, and social dimensions. We usually think of economic rankings in terms of class; belonging to a higher class means that you have more money, higher income, or greater wealth than those in lower classes. Similarly, political rankings involve differences in power—the degree to which you can compel others to do what you want them to do. Social rankings, the third dimension, concern status—how much prestige, esteem, respect, or honor one receives from others.3
   - Location: 103-108
   - Page: 7

2. For the most part, social scientists act as though class and power are more important than status.
   - Location: 108-109
   - Page: 8

3. But this ignores the central role status plays in our everyday lives. Oh, most of us may not go around flaunting pricey material goods, but we care—a lot—about whether others respect us. We think it is important to be well regarded. In extreme cases, status can become a matter of life and death. Think of innercity homicides that start with one youth “dissing” (disrespecting) another; or think of duels between high-born gentlemen over points of honor. Those are lethal arguments about status.
   - Location: 114-118
   - Page: 8

4. American sociologists have tended to conflate status and class. They speak of “socio-economic status” (SES), and much of their research on status concerns occupational prestige (basically surveys used to rank the status of different occupations—studies showing that heart surgeons are looked up to more than bootblacks).
   - Location: 132-135
   - Page: 9

5. There are all sorts of status symbols that don't cost a dime (although they may require consciously learning what to do and how to do it). We can tell a lot about people's social class by listening to them talk (What do they choose to talk about? Which words do they choose? What sort of accent do they have?) or observing them in social situations (How do they behave?).
   - Location: 140-143
   - Page: 10

6. The second problem is that, while social class and occupation certainly involve status, so do aspects of social life far removed from economic life. Max Weber coined another important concept—lifestyle.
   - Location: 147-148
   - Page: 10

7. To understand lifestyle, imagine a suburban high school where all of the students come from middle-class homes. Even though a sociologist would classify them as members of the same social class, students within that high school are able to choose their place in the school's social system. Some will become heavily involved in athletics, others in academics, still others in social life, or rebellion, or whatever. That is, within the school setting, the students—who, remember, all come from middle-class families—can come to think of themselves and be considered by others to be very different sorts of people—jocks, nerds, stoners, whatever. Each of these identities comes with a lifestyle; that is, the members of each group tend to favor particular clothing and hairstyles, musical tastes, and patterns for alcohol and drug use, so that it is fairly easy for anyone familiar with the local status symbols to classify individuals into their different lifestyle groups. The distinctions between these categories aren't rigid; some talented athletes are excellent students, and so on. Yet each group assigns respect—status—to its members based on its own criteria for excellence, and everyone knows that the groups enjoy different relative status within the school as a whole.6
   - Location: 149-158
   - Page: 10

8. Society, then, is composed of many small groups within which members assign and receive status. Sociologists disagree about the best name for these groupings; different terms emphasize different aspects of these groups. Calling them status groups plays up—and arguably exaggerates—the importance of status (the journalist Tom Wolfe coined the term statusspheres, which has the same quality). Another possibility is to speak of subcultures (which emphasizes each group's distinctive culture, its values and beliefs). Other sociologists favor scenes (a term that highlights social geography, the places where different groups congregate), fields (a concept that envisions social spaces where people compete for resources), or tribes or even neo-tribes (terms used to characterize heterogeneous groups that draw members from many different classes). Still another option—the one I prefer—is to speak of these groups as social worlds, a term that reminds us how people can become immersed—live much of their lives—within particular social groups.8
   - Location: 164-172
   - Page: 11

9. Even under conditions of status affluence, people continue to act as though status is in short supply. The proud parents who display a bumper sticker announcing that their child is a middle-school honor roll student are declaring that their kid is an especially good student. Presumably, only some—not all—of the students at that middle school are on the honor roll. If every student in the school was to be designated an “honor roll student,” then the honor might seem meaningless. Similarly, when we see a banner announcing that this shop's sandwiches have been rated tops in Delaware, we assume that other places serving sandwiches didn't get that coveted top rating. Status depends upon making distinctions between those who deserve more respect and those who merit less.
   - Location: 223-228
   - Page: 15

10. Status affluence doesn't mean that everyone is of exactly equal status. Rather, it means that there are lots of opportunities to gain status, and those opportunities are increasing.
   - Location: 229-230
   - Page: 15

11. In short, the first cause of increased status affluence is the proliferation of groups within contemporary society, because each group becomes a source for the creation of additional status.
   - Location: 268-270
   - Page: 18

12. Note, too, that establishing a new social world with its attendant status system allows further claims of distinction. Each world is able to declare its own superiority. As David Brooks observes: “[In] this country…, everybody can kick everybody else's ass. The crunchies who hike look down on the hunters who squat in the forest downing beers, and the hunters look down on the hikers who perch on logs smoking dope…. Nobody in this decentralized, fluid structure knows who is mainstream and who is alternative, who is elite and who is populist.”23 So long as each world's members talk chiefly among themselves, its status can be valued.
   - Location: 363-367
   - Page: 24

13. Prizes embody the world's shared standards for achievement or excellence; they reveal what is valued—prized—within that world. Awards offer members guidance as to what is appreciated and recognized within the social world—a sort of map for those interested in gaining status within that world's hierarchy. In addition, prize giving itself becomes an activity that helps give the social world structure by distinguishing some members as judges, worthy of assessing what is prize-worthy within that world.22

14. THEORIES OF HEROISM The nature of heroism is a topic that has inspired a good deal of pontification, and even a cursory review of some of these works reveals that hero is a slippery concept, one that can refer to very different things. For instance, in The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth, and Drama, Lord Raglan examined a range of myths and folktales, and identified a sort of formula biography for the heroes of these stories (his sample included the stories of Oedipus, Hercules, Moses, King Arthur, and Robin Hood). Most of these classical heroes’ lives shared what Raglan called a “pattern” of twenty-two “incidents”; while not every story featured every element, there was a good deal of overlap. According to Raglan: The pattern, then, is as follows:   1. The hero's mother is a royal virgin; 2. His father is a king, and 3. Often a near relative of his mother, but 4. The circumstances of his conception are unusual, and 5. He is also reputed to be the son of a god. 6. At birth an attempt is made, usually by his father or his maternal grandfather, to kill him, but 7. He is spirited away, and 8. Reared by foster-parents in a far country. And so on, right through   21. His body is not buried, but nonetheless 22. He has one or more holy sepulchres.2

15. Orrin E. Klapp—probably the American sociologist who wrote most extensively about heroes—located heroes within American culture's larger framework of social types. By social types, he meant those popular labels we use in everyday life to classify people, terms such as soccer mom and fashion victim. The cast of available social types shifts over time; once-familiar categories, such as flapper and beatnik, have fallen out of favor, only to be replaced by new ones, such as trophy wife and metrosexual. Klapp argued that most social types belong to one of three broad, melodramatic categories—heroes, villains, and fools.4 He subdivided each of these broad categories according to themes relevant to American culture; thus, he classified heroes as winners, splendid performers, heroes of social acceptability, independent spirits, and group servants. Further, he broke some of these categories down by key traits; thus, his heroic winners included the strong man, the top dog, the underdog (who wins by overcoming obstacles), the brain, the smart operator, and the great lover. Each of these traits in turn generated its own set of social types: “Americans also call [the brain] genius, mastermind, Einstein, pundit (sometimes professor, brain-truster, intellectual, intelligentsia, expert, specialist).”5
   - Location: 1253-1262
   - Page: 82

16. Klapp considers a social type heroic if, on balance, people consider it admirable. Thus, Klapp's corrupted heroes include such types as the tough guy, the smart operator, and the wolf—all figures that warrant ambivalent admiration. Nor is it necessary that people actually use the word hero to qualify as a hero in Klapp's analytic scheme. Klapp reminds us that lots of people are admired for lots of different reasons, and he uses the term hero to encompass all of them.

17. A complex society is filled with people who are recognized as having specialized knowledge, who know a lot more about some topic than the rest of us. People in traditional societies sought advice from elders who were considered wise because they had lived long enough to see more things and acquire more experience than younger people. But our society is complex enough—and fast changing enough—to make us doubt that age is the most reliable source of wisdom. Better we should ask an expert, someone who knows more than we do about some topic. Expertise in this sense does not necessarily require specialized training, but it does mean that someone has spent enough time studying a topic—and is up-to-date enough—to offer an informed assessment of various choices. Further, our culture prefers that expertise be objective, so that the relative merits of the different choices are assessed in some evenhanded way. This means, first, that ratings and rankings should be devised by people who are disinterested, whose recommendations can be trusted.

## Chaos: Making a New Science
**Author:** James Gleick

### Highlights (26)

1. The most passionate advocates of the new science go so far as to say that twentieth-century science will be remembered for just three things: relativity, quantum mechanics, and chaos.
   - Location: 120-121

2. Relativity eliminated the Newtonian illusion of absolute space and time; quantum theory eliminated the Newtonian dream of a controllable measurement process; and chaos eliminates the Laplacian fantasy of deterministic predictability.”

4. Tiny differences in input could quickly become overwhelming differences in output—a phenomenon given the name “sensitive dependence on initial conditions.” In weather, for example, this translates into what is only half-jokingly known as the Butterfly Effect—the notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm systems next month in New York.

6. THE HISTORIAN OF SCIENCE Thomas S. Kuhn describes a disturbing experiment conducted by a pair of psychologists in the 1940s. Subjects were given glimpses of playing cards, one at a time, and asked to name them. There was a trick, of course. A few of the cards were freakish: for example, a red six of spades or a black queen of diamonds. At high speed the subjects sailed smoothly along. Nothing could have been simpler. They didn’t see the anomalies at all. Shown a red six of spades, they would sing out either “six of hearts” or “six of spades.” But when the cards were displayed for longer intervals, the subjects started to hesitate. They became aware of a problem but were not sure quite what it was. A subject might say that he had seen something odd, like a red border around a black heart. Eventually, as the pace was slowed even more, most subjects would catch on. They would see the wrong cards and make the mental shift necessary to play the game without error. Not everyone, though. A few suffered a sense of disorientation that brought real pain. “I can’t make that suit out, whatever it is,” said one. “It didn’t even look like a card that time. I don’t know what color it is now or whether it’s a spade or a heart. I’m not even sure what a spade looks like. My God!”

7. In Kuhn’s scheme, normal science consists largely of mopping up operations. Experimentalists carry out modified versions of experiments that have been carried out many times before. Theorists add a brick here, reshape a cornice there, in a wall of theory. It could hardly be otherwise. If all scientists had to begin from the beginning, questioning fundamental assumptions, they would be hard pressed to reach the level of technical sophistication necessary to do useful work.
   - Location: 517-521
   - Page: 34

8. Under normal conditions the research scientist is not an innovator but a solver of puzzles, and the puzzles upon which he concentrates are just those which he believes can be both stated and solved within the existing scientific tradition,” Kuhn wrote.

9. The mathematics of ecology is to the mathematics of Steve Smale what the Ten Commandments are to the Talmud: a good set of working rules, but nothing too complicated.

10. Stanislaw Ulam remarked that to call the study of chaos “nonlinear science” was like calling zoology “the study of non elephant animals.” Yorke understood. “The first message is that there is disorder. Physicists and mathematicians want to discover regularities. People say, what use is disorder. But people have to know about disorder if they are going to deal with it. The auto mechanic who doesn’t know about sludge in valves is not a good mechanic.”

11. THE KOCH SNOWFLAKE. “A rough but vigorous model of a coastline,” in Mandelbrot’s words. To construct a Koch curve, begin with a triangle with sides of length 1. At the middle of each side, add a new triangle one-third the size; and so on. The length of the boundary is 3 × 4/3 × 4/3 × 4/3…—infinity. Yet the area remains less than the area of a circle drawn around the original triangle. Thus an infinitely long line surrounds a finite area.
   - Location: 1464-1468
   - Page: 96

12. On reflection, it becomes apparent that the Koch curve has some interesting features. For one thing, it is a continuous loop, never intersecting itself, because the new triangles on each side are always small enough to avoid bumping into each other. Each transformation adds a little area to the inside of the curve, but the total area remains finite, not much bigger than the original triangle, in fact. If you drew a circle around the original triangle, the Koch curve would never extend beyond it. Yet the curve itself is infinitely long, as long as a Euclidean straight line extending to the edges of an unbounded universe. Just as the first transformation replaces a one-foot segment with four four-inch segments, every transformation multiplies the total length by four-thirds.
   - Location: 1471-1477
   - Page: 96

13. But the outline of the Koch curve, with infinite length crowding into finite area, does fill space. It is more than a line, yet less than a plane. It is greater than one-dimensional, yet less than a two-dimensional form. Using techniques originated by mathematicians early in the century and then all but forgotten, Mandelbrot could characterize the fractional dimension precisely. For the Koch curve, the infinitely extended multiplication by four-thirds gives a dimension of 1.2618.

14. CONSTRUCTING WITH HOLES. A few mathematicians in the early twentieth century conceived monstrous-seeming objects made by the technique of adding or removing infinitely many parts. One such shape is the Sierpinski carpet, constructed by cutting the center one-ninth of a square; then cutting out the centers of the eight smaller squares that remain; and so on. The three-dimensional analogue is the Menger sponge, a solid-looking lattice that has an infinite surface area, yet zero volume.

16. One simple but powerful consequence of the fractal geometry of surfaces is that surfaces in contact do not touch everywhere. The bumpiness at all scales prevents that. Even in rock under enormous pressure, at some sufficiently small scale it becomes clear that gaps remain, allowing fluid to flow. To Scholz, it is the Humpty-Dumpty Effect. It is why two pieces of a broken teacup can never be rejoined, even though they appear to fit together at some gross scale. At a smaller scale, irregular bumps are failing to coincide.

18. The standard “exponential” description of bronchial branching proved to be quite wrong; a fractal description turned out to fit the data. The urinary collecting system proved fractal. The biliary duct in the liver. The network of special fibers in the heart that carry pulses of electric current to the contracting muscles. The last structure, known to heart specialists as the His-Purkinje network, inspired a particularly important line of research. Considerable work on healthy and abnormal hearts turned out to hinge on the details of how the muscle cells of the left and right pumping chambers all manage to coordinate their timing. Several chaos-minded cardiologists found that the frequency spectrum of heartbeat timing, like earthquakes and economic phenomena, followed fractal laws, and they argued that one key to understanding heartbeat timing was the fractal organization of the His-Purkinje network, a labyrinth of branching pathways organized to be self-similar on smaller and smaller scales.

19. If one scientist announces that a thing is probably true, and another demonstrates it with rigor, which one has done more to advance science? Is the making of a conjecture an act of discovery? Or is it just a cold-blooded staking of a claim? Mathematicians have always faced such issues, but the debate became more intense as computers began to play their new role. Those who used computers to conduct experiments became more like laboratory scientists, playing by rules that allowed discovery without the usual theorem-proof, theorem-proof of the standard mathematics paper.

20. DAVID RUELLE SOMETIMES SAID there were two kinds of physicists, the kind that grew up taking apart radios—this being an era before solid-state, when you could still look at wires and orange-glowing vacuum tubes and imagine something about the flow of electrons—and the kind that played with chemistry sets. Ruelle played with chemistry sets, or not quite sets in the later American sense, but chemicals, explosive or poisonous, cheerfully dispensed in his native northern Belgium by the local pharmacist and then mixed, stirred, heated, crystallized, and sometimes blown up by Ruelle himself.

It was in mathematical physics, though, that Ruelle made his lasting contribution to the exploration of chaos.

24. Mandell offered his colleagues a chilling assessment of the most commonly used drugs. Phenothiazines, prescribed for schizophrenics, make the fundamental disorder worse. Tricyclic anti-depressants “increase the rate of mood cycling, leading to long-term increases in numbers of relapsing psychopathologic episodes.” And so on. Only lithium has any real medical success, Mandell said, and only for some disorders. As he saw it, the problem was conceptual. Traditional methods for treating this “most unstable, dynamic, infinite-dimensional machine” were linear and reductionist. “The underlying paradigm remains: one gene → one peptide → one enzyme → one neurotransmitter → one receptor → one animal behavior → one clinical syndrome → one drug → one clinical rating scale. It dominates almost all research and treatment in psychopharmacology. More than 50 transmitters, thousands of cell types, complex electromagnetic phenomenology, and continuous instability based autonomous activity at all levels, from proteins to the electroencephalogram—and still the brain is thought of as a chemical point-to–point switchboard.” To someone exposed to the world of nonlinear dynamics the response could only be: How naïve. Mandell urged his colleagues to understand the flowing geometries that sustain complex systems like the mind.

As a growing snowflake falls to earth, typically floating in the wind for an hour or more, the choices made by the branching tips at any instant depend sensitively on such things as the temperature, the humidity, and the presence of impurities in the atmosphere. The six tips of a single snowflake, spreading within a millimeter space, feel the same temperatures, and because the laws of growth are purely deterministic, they maintain a near-perfect symmetry. But the nature of turbulent air is such that any pair of snowflakes will experience very different paths. The final flake records the history of all the changing weather conditions it has experienced, and the combinations may as well be infinite.

## Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup
**Author:** Andrew Zimbalist

### Highlights (1)

1. With Olympics bidding, the typical pattern is for a country's National Olympic Committee (NOC) to call for bids from prospective host cities eleven years before the games. There ensues a competition among the interested cities to win their country's nod, which occurs nine years prior to the games. The selected cities at this stage are known as “applicants,” and each pays the IOC $150,000 to be considered. The applicant cities are then whittled down to a group of usually three to five finalist or “candidate” cities. Each candidate city pays the IOC an additional $500,000 for the privilege of being considered as an Olympic host. The bids by cities are driven by major private economic interests within the city's political economy, such as construction companies, construction unions, insurance companies, architectural firms, hotels, local media companies, investment bankers (who will float the bonds), and the lawyers who work for these groups.9 These groups in turn hire a public relations firm and a consulting firm to generate interest and excitement around the hosting prospect and to make elaborate claims of the potential economic benefits to the city. Except in special cases, however, the promised benefits are not forthcoming. Equally troublesome, to prepare for the games the host city often must clear land, which frequently means relocating communities and jobs; hire migrant labor; divert resources away from important social services; and borrow billions, encumbering future tax dollars. Along the way, local communities experience congestion and pollution in the name of constructing venues and infrastructure that may have little or no effective use after the games and that may charge admission prices well beyond the reach of the common person's budget. Seven years before the games, after two years of competition among the candidate cities aimed to convince the IOC that they are the most worthy of the hosting honor, the IOC anoints a winner. A similar selection process occurs for the World Cup. With multiple bidders from around the globe and only one seller (the IOC or FIFA), it is almost unavoidable that the winning city or country will have overbid. This outcome is made even more likely because the groups pushing each city's bid are representing their own private interests, not the city's. And these groups will not have to pay the construction bills; rather, they will be the ones on the receiving end, getting the lucrative contracts. Economists believe the outcome of such a bidding process is likely to result in a “winner's curse”—an outcome in which the winner has bid above the object's true worth.

## Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics
**Author:** Richard H. Thaler

### Highlights (51)

1. Kahneman and Tversky were waving a big red flag that said these errors were not random. Ask people whether there are more gun deaths caused by homicide or suicide in the U.S., and most will guess homicide, but in fact there are almost twice as many gun deaths by suicide than homicides.† This is a predictable error. Even across many people, the errors will not average out to zero.

2. Two kinds of theories The organizing principle was the existence of two different kinds of theories: normative and descriptive. Normative theories tell you the right way to think about some problem. By “right” I do not mean right in some moral sense; instead, I mean logically consistent, as prescribed by the optimizing model at the heart of economic reasoning, sometimes called rational choice theory. That is the only way I will use the word “normative” in this book. For instance, the Pythagorean theorem is a normative theory of how to calculate the length of one side of a right triangle if you know the length of the other two sides. If you use any other formula you will be wrong.

3. Ever since Bernoulli, economic models were based on a simple assumption that people have “diminishing marginal utility of wealth,” as illustrated in figure 2. This model of the utility of wealth gets the basic psychology of wealth right. But to create a better descriptive model, Kahneman and Tversky recognized that we had to change our focus from levels of wealth to changes in wealth.

4. Kahneman and Tversky focus on changes because changes are the way Humans experience life.

5. The figure in the paper so captured my imagination that I drew a version of it on the blackboard right next to the List. Have another look at it now. There is an enormous amount of wisdom about human nature captured in that S-shaped curve. The upper portion, for gains, has the same shape as the usual utility of wealth function, capturing the idea of diminishing sensitivity. But notice that the loss function captures diminishing sensitivity also. The difference between losing $10 and $20 feels much bigger than the difference between losing $1,300 and $1,310.

6. The fact that we experience diminishing sensitivity to changes away from the status quo captures another basic human trait—one of the earliest findings in psychology—known as the Weber-Fechner Law. The Weber-Fechner Law holds that the just-noticeable difference in any variable is proportional to the magnitude of that variable. If I gain one ounce, I don’t notice it, but if I am buying fresh herbs, the difference between 2 ounces and 3 ounces is obvious. Psychologists refer to a just noticeable difference as a JND.

7. In one show a caller asked: “Both my headlights went out at the same time. I took the car to the shop but the mechanic said that all I needed was two new bulbs. How can that be right? Isn’t it too big of a coincidence that both bulbs blew out at the same time?” Tom answered the question in a flash. “Ah, the famous Weber-Fechner Law!” It turns out that Tom also did a PhD in psychology and marketing supervised by Max Bazerman, a leading scholar in judgment and decision-making research. So, what does the caller’s question have to do with the Weber-Fechner Law, and how did this insight help Tom solve the problem? The answer is that the two bulbs did not in fact burn out at the same time. It is easy to drive around with one bulb burned out and not notice, especially if you live in a well-lit city. Going from two bulbs to one is not always a noticeable difference. But going from one to zero is definitely noticeable.

8. The fact that people have diminishing sensitivity to both gains and losses has another implication. People will be risk-averse for gains, but risk-seeking for losses,
   - Location: 582-583
   - Page: 38

9. The reason why people are risk-seeking for losses is the same logic that applies to why they are risk-averse for gains. In the case of problem 2, the pain of losing the second hundred dollars is less than the pain of losing the first hundred, so subjects are ready to take the risk of losing more in order to have the chance of getting back to no loss at all. They are especially keen to eliminate a loss altogether because of the third feature captured in figure 3: loss aversion. Examine the value function in this figure at the origin, where both curves begin. Notice that the loss function is steeper than the gain function: it decreases more quickly than the gain function goes up. Roughly speaking, losses hurt about twice as much as gains make you feel good.
   - Location: 595-600

10. So, we experience life in terms of changes, we feel diminishing sensitivity to both gains and losses, and losses sting more than equivalently-sized gains feel good.

11. Sarah Lichtenstein and Paul Slovic. Lichtenstein and Slovic had discovered “preference reversals,” a phenomenon that proved disconcerting to economists. In brief, subjects were induced to say that they preferred choice A to choice B . . . and also that they preferred B to A. This finding upset a theoretical foundation essential to any formal economic theory, namely that people have what are called “well-defined preferences,” which simply means that we consistently know what we like. Economists don’t care whether you like a firm mattress better than a soft one or vice versa, but they cannot tolerate you saying that you like a firm mattress better than a soft one and a soft one better than a firm one. That will not do. Economic theory textbooks would stop on the first page if the assumption of well-ordered preferences had to be abandoned, because without stable preferences there is nothing to be optimized.

12. The style of experiment Kahneman and Tversky ran was often faulted as a “one-shot” game. In the “real world,” economists argued, people have opportunities to learn. The idea is reasonable enough.

14. Psychologists tell us that in order to learn from experience, two ingredients are necessary: frequent practice and immediate feedback. When these conditions are present, such as when we learn to ride a bike or drive a car, we learn, possibly with some mishaps along the way. But many of life’s problems do not offer these opportunities,

15. The next day I presented what I now call the “Binmore continuum” in his honor. I wrote a list of products on the blackboard that varied from left to right based on frequency of purchase. On the left I started with cafeteria lunch (daily), then milk and bread (twice a week), and so forth up to sweaters, cars, and homes, career choices, and spouses (not more than two or three per lifetime for most of us). Notice the trend. We do small stuff often enough to learn to get it right, but when it comes to choosing a home, a mortgage, or a job, we don’t get much practice or opportunities to learn. And when it comes to saving for retirement, barring reincarnation we do that exactly once. So Binmore had it backward. Because learning takes practice, we are more likely to get things right at small stakes than at large stakes.

17. If you understand opportunity costs and you have a ticket to a game that you could sell for $1,000, it does not matter how much you paid for the ticket. The cost of going to the game is what you could do with that $1,000. You should only go to the game if that is the best possible way you could use that money. Is it better than one hundred movies at $10 each? Better than an upgrade to your shabby wardrobe? Better than saving the money for a rainy day or a sunny weekend? This analysis is not limited to decisions that involve money. If you spend an afternoon reading a novel, then the opportunity cost is whatever else you might have done with that time.

18. Eventually I settled on a formulation that involves two kinds of utility: acquisition utility and transaction utility. Acquisition utility is based on standard economic theory and is equivalent to what economists call “consumer surplus.” As the name suggests, it is the surplus remaining after we measure the utility of the object gained and then subtract the opportunity cost of what has to be given up. For an Econ, acquisition utility is the end of the story. A purchase will produce an abundance of acquisition utility only if a consumer values something much more than the marketplace does. If you are very thirsty, then a one-dollar bottle of water is a utility windfall. And for an Econ who owns a double bed, the acquisition utility of a quilt that fits the bed would be greater than one that hangs two feet over the side in every direction.

19. Humans, on the other hand, also weigh another aspect of the purchase: the perceived quality of the deal. That is what transaction utility captures. It is defined as the difference between the price actually paid for the object and the price one would normally expect to pay, the reference price. Suppose you are at a sporting event and you buy a sandwich identical to the one you usually have at lunch, but it costs triple the price. The sandwich is fine but the deal stinks. It produces negative transaction utility, a “rip-off.” In contrast, if the price is below the reference price, then transaction utility is positive, a “bargain,” like Maya’s extra-large quilt selling for the same price as a smaller one.

20. You are lying on the beach on a hot day. All you have to drink is ice water. For the last hour you have been thinking about how much you would enjoy a nice cold bottle of your favorite brand of beer. A companion gets up to go make a phone call and offers to bring back a beer from the only nearby place where beer is sold (a fancy resort hotel) [a small, rundown grocery store]. He says that the beer might be expensive so asks how much you are willing to pay for the beer. He says he will buy the beer if it costs as much or less than what you state. But if it costs more than the price you state, he will not buy it. You trust your friend, and there is no possibility of bargaining with the (bartender) [store owner]. What price will you tell him? There are several things to notice about this example, which was fine-tuned to deal with the objections I anticipated hearing from economists. Crucially, the consumption act is identical in the two situations. The respondent gets to drink one bottle of his favorite brand of beer on the beach. He never enters or even sees the establishment from which the beer has been purchased, and thus does not consume any ambience, positive or negative. Also, by ruling out any negotiation with the seller, the respondents have no reason to disguise their true preferences. In economists’ lingo, the situation is incentive compatible. With those provisos out of the way, we can proceed to the punch line. People are willing to pay more for the beer if it was purchased from the resort than from the convenience store. The median† answers, adjusted for inflation, were $7.25 and $4.10. These results show that people are willing to pay different prices for the same beer, consumed at the same spot on the beach, depending on where it was bought. Why do the respondents care where the beer was bought? One reason is expectations. People expect prices to be higher at a fancy hotel, in part because the costs are quite obviously higher. Paying seven dollars for a beer at a resort is annoying but expected; paying that at a bodega is an outrage! This is the essence of transaction utility.

21. The beer on the beach example illustrates a case where someone can be dissuaded from making a worthwhile purchase. Suppose Dennis says he would only pay $4 for the beer from the bodega, but $7 from the hotel. His friend Tom could make Dennis happier if bought the beer at the store for $5 but told Dennis he had bought it from the hotel.

22. For those who are at least living comfortably, negative transaction utility can prevent our consuming special experiences that will provide a lifetime of happy memories, and the amount by which the item was overpriced will long be forgotten. Good deals, on the other hand, can lure all of us into making purchases of objects of little value.
   - Location: 1016-1019
   - Page: 67

23. Because consumers think this way, sellers have an incentive to manipulate the perceived reference price and create the illusion of a “deal.” One example that has been used for decades is announcing a largely fictional “suggested retail price,” which actually just serves as a misleading suggested reference price. In America, some products always seem to be on sale, such as rugs and mattresses, and at some retailers, men’s suits. Goods that are marketed this way share two characteristics: they are bought infrequently and quality is difficult to assess. The infrequent purchases help because consumers often do not notice that there is always a sale going on. Most of us are pleasantly surprised that when we wander in to buy a new mattress, there happens to be a sale this week. And when the quality of a product, like a mattress, is hard to assess, the suggested retail price can do double duty. It can simultaneously suggest that quality is high (thus increasing perceived acquisition utility) and imply that there is transaction utility to be had because the product is “on sale.”

24. Shoppers can get hooked on the thrill derived from transaction utility. If a retailer known for frequent discounting tries to wean their customers away from expecting great deals, it can struggle. Several retailers have tried over the years to entice customers with something called “everyday low pricing,” but these experiments usually fail.‡ Getting a great deal is more fun than saving a small and largely invisible amount on each item.

26. Kahneman and Tversky explained this finding by relying on the feature of prospect theory that people are risk-seeking when it concerns losses. As was discussed in chapter 4, if you ask people whether they would rather lose $100 for sure or choose a gamble in which they have a 50% chance of losing $200 and a 50% chance of breaking even, a majority will choose the gamble. These results are the opposite of those found when the choice is between a guaranteed gain of $100 and a 50-50 gamble for $0 or $200, where people prefer the sure thing.

28. To see why exponential discounters stick to their plans while hyperbolic (present-biased) discounters do not, let’s consider a simple numerical example. Suppose Ted and Matthew both live in London and are avid tennis fans. Each has won a lottery offering a ticket to a match at Wimbledon, with an intertemporal twist. They can choose among three options. Option A is a ticket to a first-round match this year; in fact, the match is tomorrow. Option B is a quarterfinal match at next year’s tournament. Option C is the final, at the tournament to be held two years from now. All the tickets are guaranteed, so we can leave risk considerations out of our analysis, and Ted and Matthew have identical tastes in tennis. If the matches were all for this year’s tournament, the utilities they would assign to them are as follows: A: 100, B: 150, C: 180. But in order to go to their favorite option C, the final, they have to wait two years. What will they do? If Ted had this choice, he would choose to wait two years and go the final. He would do so because the value he puts right now on going to the final in two years (its “present value”) is 146 (81% of 180), which is greater than the present value of A (100) or B (135, or 90% of 150). Furthermore, after a year has passed, if Ted is asked whether he wants to change his mind and go to option B, the quarterfinal, he will say no, since 90% of the value of C (162) is still greater than the value of B. This is what it means to have time-consistent preferences. Ted will always stick to whatever plan he makes at the beginning, no matter what options he faces. What about Matthew? When first presented with the choice, he would also choose option C, the final. Right now he values A at 100, B at 105 (70% of 150) and C at 113 (63% of 180). But unlike Ted, when a year passes, Matthew will change his mind and switch to B, the quarterfinal, because waiting one year discounts the value of C by 70% to 126, which is less than 150, the current value of B. He is time-inconsistent.

29. once Samuelson wrote down this model and it became widely adopted, most economists developed a malady that Kahneman calls theory-induced blindness. In their enthusiasm about incorporating their newfound mathematic rigor, they forgot all about the highly behavioral writings on intertemporal choice that had come before, even those of Irving Fisher that had appeared a mere seven years earlier. They also forgot about Samuelson’s warnings that his model might not be descriptively accurate. Exponential discounting just had to be the right model of intertemporal choice because Econs would not keep changing their minds, and the world they now studied no longer contained any Humans. This theory-induced blindness now strikes nearly everyone who receives a PhD in economics.

30. To understand the consumption behavior of households, we clearly need to get back to studying Humans rather than Econs. Humans do not have the brains of Einstein (or Barro), nor do they have the self-control of an ascetic Buddhist monk. Rather, they have passions, faulty telescopes, treat various pots of wealth quite differently, and can be influenced by short-run returns in the stock market. We need a model of these kinds of Humans.

31. At some point in pondering these questions, I came across a quote from social scientist Donald McIntosh that profoundly influenced my thinking: “The idea of self-control is paradoxical unless it is assumed that the psyche contains more than one energy system, and that these energy systems have some degree of independence from each other.” The passage is from an obscure book, The Foundations of Human Society.

32. As intuitively appealing as this idea was to me, any sort of two-self model had the disadvantage of being considered radical in economics but passé in psychology: not a great combination. Few economists, including me when I was getting started on this work, were aware of Adam Smith’s discussion of the battle between our passions and our impartial spectator. To most the idea just seemed wacky. Academic psychologists at that time were no longer much enamored of Freud with his id, ego, and superego, and the two-system view that is now very much in vogue had yet to emerge.‡

34. In a principal–agent model the principal is the boss, often the owner of a firm, and the agent is someone to whom authority is delegated. In the context of an organization, tensions arise because the agent knows some things that the principal does not, and it is too costly for the principal to monitor every action that the agent takes. The agent in these models tries to make as much money as possible while minimizing effort. In response, the firm adopts a set of rules and procedures (incentive schemes and accounting systems, for example) that are designed to minimize the costs of the conflicts of interest between the principal and the agents employed at the firm. For example, a salesperson might get paid mostly on commission, have to turn in receipts to document travel expenses, and be forbidden to fly first class.

35. This same principle applies in organizations. If the principal knows exactly what the agent should do in every situation, then she can create a rulebook that is never to be violated. But we have all had the frustration of dealing with a low-level agent who is working under such rules and does not have the discretion to do something that is obviously sensible but had not been anticipated, and is therefore “not allowed.”

36. in our second paper noting that one could think of the planner as residing in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain, which is associated with conscious, rational thinking, whereas the doer can be associated with the limbic system. For those who are familiar with the two-system model such as the one Kahneman describes in Thinking, Fast and Slow, it is reasonable to think of the planner as the slow, reflective, contemplative System 2 while the doers are the fast, impulsive, intuitive System 1. Recent research in neuro-economics offers some support for this interpretation. But for practical purposes, it does not matter whether the model has a physiological basis. It is a metaphor that helps us think about how to incorporate self-control into economics.

37. Matthew Rabin and Ted O’Donoghue, elaborated on this approach, which most economists now just refer to using the two Greek letters that represent the important variables: beta (β) and delta (δ). The subtleties of the model are difficult to explain without going into some detail, but references to the key papers are provided in the endnotes. The crucial advantage that the beta–delta model has over the planner and the doer is mathematical simplicity. It is the smallest possible modification of Samuelson’s basic model that can capture the essential aspects of self-control.
   - Location: 1815-1819
   - Page: 119

38. Here is a simple way of thinking about how the beta–delta model works. Suppose that for any time period far enough away to be considered “later,” a person does not discount time at all, meaning that the discount rate is zero. But anything considered “now” is privileged and tempting, and anything considered “later” is worth only half as much. In the Wimbledon example discussed earlier, the first-round match that would be valued at 100 this year would only be worth 50 next year or any year thereafter. Such preferences are “present-biased” since they put so much weight on now versus later, and they lead to time-inconsistent choices.
   - Location: 1819-1824
   - Page: 119

39. When David Laibson wrote his first paper on this subject he assumed that agents were “sophisticated,” meaning that they knew they had this pattern of time preferences. As a graduate student trying to get a job with a paper on behavioral economic theory (a category that was then essentially unknown), it was clever of David to characterize the model this way. David’s agents were pure Econs except for one detail; they had problematic time preferences. When O’Donoghue and Rabin decided to join the party they considered a more radical approach, in which agents have present-biased preferences but are unaware of their affliction. Such agents are considered “naïve.” Not surprisingly, neither of these simple formulations portrays a fully accurate description of behavior. I share a view held by all three authors that the “truth” is somewhere in between the two extremes: partial naiveté. Most of us realize that we have self-control problems, but we underestimate their severity. We are naïve about our level of sophistication.

42. One principle that emerged from our research is that perceptions of fairness are related to the endowment effect. Both buyers and sellers feel entitled to the terms of trade to which they have become accustomed, and treat any deterioration of those terms as a loss. This feeling of ownership of the usual conditions of sale is particularly true when a seller starts to charge for something that has traditionally been given away for free or included in the price. In this way, the status quo becomes a reference point. If restaurants started charging extra to be able to sit down while you eat, that would be violating the existing norm that dinner meals include a chair, although it does not have to be comfortable. Nevertheless, citizens think that firms and employers are entitled to make a (reasonable) profit. Firms are not expected to give away their products. One implication is that raising prices because costs have increased is almost always judged to be fair. Perceptions of fairness also help explain a long-standing puzzle in economics: in recessions, why don’t wages fall enough to keep everyone employed? In a land of Econs, when the economy goes into a recession and firms face a drop in the demand for their goods and services, their first reaction would not be to simply lay off employees. The theory of equilibrium says that when the demand for something falls, in this case labor, prices should also fall enough for supply to equal demand. So we would expect to see that firms would reduce wages when the economy tanks, allowing them to also cut the price of their products and still make a profit. But this is not what we see: wages and salaries appear to be sticky. When a recession hits, either wages do not fall at all or they fall too little to keep everyone employed. Why? One partial explanation for this fact is that cutting wages makes workers so angry that firms find it better to keep pay levels fixed and just lay off surplus employees (who are then not around to complain). It turns out, however, that with the help of some inflation, it is possible to reduce “real” wages (that is, adjusted for inflation) with much less pushback from workers.

43. A few years after my time with Danny in Vancouver, I wrote an article about cooperation with the psychologist Robyn Dawes. In the conclusion, we drew an analogy with the roadside stands one would often see in the rural areas around Ithaca. A farmer would put some produce for sale out on a table in front of his farm. There was a box with a small slot to insert the payment, so money could be put in but not taken out. The box was also nailed to the table. I thought then, and think now, that farmers who use this system have a pretty good model of human nature in mind. There are enough honest people out there (especially in a small town) to make it worthwhile for the farmer to put out some fresh corn or rhubarb to sell. But they also know that if the money were left in an open box where anyone could take all of it, someone eventually would. Economists need to adopt as nuanced a view of human nature as the farmers. Not everyone will free ride all the time, but some people are ready to pick your pocket if you are not careful. I keep a photograph of one of those farm stands in my office for inspiration.

45. An important aspect of Thomas Kuhn’s model of scientific revolutions, which came up at the end of the Chicago conference, is that paradigms change only once experts believe there are a large number of anomalies that are not explained by the current paradigm. A few scattered unexplained facts are not enough to upend the conventional wisdom.

46. There are several possible reasons why psychologists might have failed to engage. First, since few have any attachment to the rational choice model, studying departures from it is not considered inherently interesting. A typical reaction would be: “Of course people pay attention to sunk costs! Who would have thought otherwise?” Second, the psychology that behavioral economists have ended up using is not considered cutting-edge to psychologists. If psychologists started using supply and demand curves in their research papers, economists would not find the idea very exciting. Finally, for some reason the study of “applied” problems in psychology has traditionally been considered a low-status activity. Studying the reasons why people fall into debt or drop out of school has just not been the type of research that leads academic psychologists to fame and glory, with the notable exception of Robert Cialdini.

47. The “timid choices” part of the Kahneman and Lovallo story is based on loss aversion. Each manager is loss averse regarding any outcomes that will be attributed to him. In an organizational setting, the natural feeling of loss aversion can be exacerbated by the system of rewards and punishment. In many companies, creating a large gain will lead to modest rewards, while creating an equal-sized loss will get you fired. Under those terms, even a manager who starts out risk neutral, willing to take any bet that will make money on average, will become highly risk averse. Rather than solving a problem, the organizational structure is making things worse.

48. An implication of this analysis is that the more often people look at their portfolios, the less willing they will be to take on risk, because if you look more often, you will see more losses. And in fact, that is an implication I later explored with Kahneman and Tversky. This would be the only paper that Amos, Danny, and I published together (along with Danny’s then-student Alan Schwartz, now a professor of medical decision-making at the University of Illinois at Chicago).

50. People are more willing to lie by omission than commission. If I am selling you a used car, I do not feel obligated to mention that the car is burning a lot of oil, but if you ask me explicitly: “Does this car burn a lot of oil?” you are likely to wangle an admission from me that yes, there has been a small problem along those lines. To get at the truth, it helps to ask specific questions.

51. But we cannot expect people to take risks, by speaking up or in other ways, if by so doing they will get fired. Good leaders must create environments in which employees feel that making evidence-based decisions will always be rewarded, no matter what outcome occurs. The ideal organizational environment encourages everyone to observe, collect data, and speak up. The bosses who create such environments are risking only one thing: a few bruises to their egos. That is a small price to pay for increasing the flow of new ideas and decreasing the risks of disasters.

## Say What?: The Weird and Mysterious Journey of the English Language
**Author:** Gena K. Gorrell

### Highlights (11)

1. People sometimes confuse the possessive s with the plural s. This mistake so often appears on shop signs that it’s known as the greengrocer’s apostrophe. Another common mistake is to put an apostrophe in the possessive its. Remember: the possessive his, hers, and its have no apostrophe. It’s is short for it is.

2. Fewer jobs? Less jobs? Which is right? Fewer refers to things counted in whole numbers; less is for things you might have just part of. You wash fewer than three teacups but you drink less than three cups of tea (maybe just two and a half). You go trick-or-treating at fewer than twenty houses (it must be raining!) and bring home less than two bags of loot (the second bag isn’t full).

3. As the Anglo-Saxons took over, many Celts fled back across the sea to Europe, or deeper into the hinterlands of the west and south. The Anglo-Saxons dismissed them as foreigners, Wealas – the root of our word Welsh. (To this day Wales and Cornwall, in the far southwest, are strongholds of Celtic history and language.) The Wealas built tiny chapels and erected stone crosses, and clung to their Christianity. But while their faith remained strong, their memory of Latin slipped away. They repeated the rites and ceremonies of their church, but many of them barely understood the words they were saying.

5. Dr. Thomas Bowdler appreciated Shakespeare’s genius, but thought his writing was spoiled by indecent words, scenes, and even plots. In 1807 Bowdler published a new collection of Shakespeare, “improving” the parts he disapproved of. Today, bowdlerizing means rewriting someone else’s work, changing the parts you find unacceptable.

6. With Shakespeare and others doing so much writing, thousands of new words entered the English language. It’s impossible to say how many were actually invented by Shakespeare, but as far as we know, the following (and many others) first appear in his writing: countless, courtship, critical, excellent, frugal, horrid, leapfrog, lonely.

7. In Macbeth, Shakespeare describes three witches as “weird sisters.” The witches foretell Macbeth’s fate (death – though he misunderstands them), and weird comes from the Old English wyrd meaning fate, “what will be.” But over the years, audiences watching these eerie characters have given the word a new meaning: “strange and bizarre.”

It filled twelve immense volumes — “fat, heavy, shelf-bendingly huge” — with more than four hundred thousand words, and almost two million quotations. One of the many assistants who worked on it was Tolkien, author of Lord of the Rings; he was assigned to the letter w, and wrestled with words like wallop, walrus, and wasp.

## Where Do Camels Belong?: Why Invasive Species Aren't All Bad
**Author:** Ken Thompson

### Highlights (2)

1. Considering their relatively brief tenure, the Romans introduced a long list of plants to Britain. This includes another long list of weeds (basically most of the suitable candidates not present already), plus millet, lentil, fig, olive, medlar, pear, almond, peach, garlic, onion, shallot, leek, cabbage, pea, cucumber, lettuce, turnip, radish, asparagus, rosemary, thyme, bay, basil, walnut, sweet chestnut, ‘real’ apples (as opposed to the native crab apple), grapevine and mulberry. It’s a testament to its subsequent importance as a dietary staple that the leek, a Roman introduction, was later adopted as the national emblem of Wales. If we add guinea fowl, chickens, rabbits, brown hare and pheasants to the long list of plants, it’s clear that food as we know it in Britain really only began with the Romans.

2. So, there’s a journalist on the phone, and he wants an answer now: ‘Will the Asian giant hornet invade Britain and wipe out all our honeybees?’ Privately, you think both of those propositions are pretty unlikely, but if it’s not a threat why would anyone pay you to go to the south of France and study the critter? In any case, by the time you’ve explained that most introductions fail completely, that hardly any of those that succeed go on to cause any kind of problem, and that among those that do it’s rarely the ones anyone worried about beforehand, you know you’ll be talking to yourself. On balance, it’s much easier to admit it’s not impossible, thus contributing to tomorrow’s news headline. Note that no one needs to be actively dishonest in order to stoke public paranoia; all that’s necessary is to admit there are a handful of genuine invasive alien horror stories, that it’s conceivable that your favourite study species could one day be among them, and generally to be unwilling to give your journalist interlocutor the short lecture course in basic biology and how to distinguish correlation from causation that he so clearly needs but is unlikely to absorb. If, as a result, you end up surfing a wave of popular concern, rather than becalmed with all the dead seaweed and other dreary flotsam, then that’s hardly your fault, is it?

## The Hunt for Vulcan: . . . And How Albert Einstein Destroyed a Planet, Discovered Relativity, and Deciphered the Universe
**Author:** Thomas Levenson

### Highlights (3)

1. These laws are simple in the sense the physicist Richard Feynman meant when he described solving a problem in Newton’s Principia: “ ‘Elementary’ does not mean easy to understand. ‘Elementary’ means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence.”
   - Location: 785-788
   - Page: 52

2. In its most compact form, that discovery boils down to a single equation, now called Einstein’s, a single line of symbols from which all else flows: On one side lies space-time; on the other lies matter-energy: together, the two halves of the universe. The equation defines their relationship—most simply, it shows how matter and energy together tell space-time (the universe) what shape to be, and how space-time tells matter-energy (all that the universe contains) how to move.

3. What moral to draw, then, of the nonexistence of an innermost planet and the universal triumph of general relativity? At the least this: Science is unique among human ways of knowing because it is self-correcting. Every claim is provisional, which is to say each is incomplete in some small or, occasionally, truly consequential way.

2. originality involves introducing and advancing an idea that’s relatively unusual within a particular domain, and that has the potential to improve it. Originality itself starts with creativity: generating a concept that is both novel and useful. But it doesn’t stop there. Originals are people who take the initiative to make their visions a reality.

3. a team led by political psychologist John Jost explored how people responded to undesirable default conditions. Compared to European Americans, African Americans were less satisfied with their economic circumstances but perceived economic inequality as more legitimate and just. Compared to people in the highest income bracket, people in the lowest income bracket were 17 percent more likely to view economic inequality as necessary. And when asked whether they would support laws that limit the rights of citizens and the press to criticize the government if enacting such legislation was necessary to solve our nation’s problems, twice as many people in the lowest income bracket were willing to give up the right to free speech as those in the highest income bracket. After finding that disadvantaged groups consistently support the status quo more than advantaged groups, Jost and his colleagues concluded: “People who suffer the most from a given state of affairs are paradoxically the least likely to question, challenge, reject, or change it.”

4. Justifying the default system serves a soothing function. It’s an emotional painkiller: If the world is supposed to be this way, we don’t need to be dissatisfied with it. But acquiescence also robs us of the moral outrage to stand against injustice and the creative will to consider alternative ways that the world could work.

5. Although child prodigies are often rich in both talent and ambition, what holds them back from moving the world forward is that they don’t learn to be original. As they perform in Carnegie Hall, win the science Olympics, and become chess champions, something tragic happens: Practice makes perfect, but it doesn’t make new. The gifted learn to play magnificent Mozart melodies and beautiful Beethoven symphonies, but never compose their own original scores. They focus their energy on consuming existing scientific knowledge, not producing new insights. They conform to the codified rules of established games, rather than inventing their own rules or their own games. All along the way, they strive to earn the approval of their parents and the admiration of their teachers.
   - Location: 209-214
   - Page: 14

6. Research demonstrates that it is the most creative children who are the least likely to become the teacher’s pet. In one study, elementary school teachers listed their favorite and least favorite students, and then rated both groups on a list of characteristics. The least favorite students were the non-conformists who made up their own rules. Teachers tend to discriminate against highly creative students, labeling them as troublemakers. In response, many children quickly learn to get with the program, keeping their original ideas to themselves.

7. When achievement motivation goes sky-high, it can crowd out originality: The more you value achievement, the more you come to dread failure. Instead of aiming for unique accomplishments, the intense desire to succeed leads us to strive for guaranteed success.

8. when an angel investor offered $250,000 to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak to bankroll Apple in 1977, it came with an ultimatum: Wozniak would have to leave Hewlett-Packard. He refused. “I still intended to be at that company forever,” Wozniak reflects. “My psychological block was really that I didn’t want to start a company. Because I was just afraid,” he admits. Wozniak changed his mind only after being encouraged by Jobs, multiple friends, and his own parents.

9. “On matters of style, swim with the current,” Thomas Jefferson allegedly advised, but “on matters of principle, stand like a rock.” The pressure to achieve leads us to do the opposite. We find surface ways of appearing original—donning a bow tie, wearing bright red shoes—without taking the risk of actually being original. When it comes to the powerful ideas in our heads and the core values in our hearts, we censor ourselves. “There are so few originals in life,” says renowned executive Mellody Hobson, because people are afraid to “speak up and stand out.”

10. Entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs had 33 percent lower odds of failure than those who quit. If you’re risk averse and have some doubts about the feasibility of your ideas, it’s likely that your business will be built to last. If you’re a freewheeling gambler, your startup is far more fragile.
   - Location: 329-331
   - Page: 22

11. Originals do vary in their attitudes toward risk. Some are skydiving gamblers; others are penny-pinching germophobes. To become original, you have to try something new, which means accepting some measure of risk. But the most successful originals are not the daredevils who leap before they look. They are the ones who reluctantly tiptoe to the edge of a cliff, calculate the rate of descent, triple-check their parachutes, and set up a safety net at the bottom just in case.
   - Location: 413-416
   - Page: 27

12. Ultimately, the people who choose to champion originality are the ones who propel us forward. After spending years studying them and interacting with them, I am struck that their inner experiences are not any different from our own. They feel the same fear, the same doubt, as the rest of us. What sets them apart is that they take action anyway. They know in their hearts that failing would yield less regret than failing to try.

13. Social scientists have long known that we tend to be overconfident when we evaluate ourselves. Here are some highlights of their findings: • High school seniors: 70 percent report that they have “above average” leadership skills, compared with 2 percent “below average”; in the ability to get along with others, 25 percent rate themselves in the top 1 percent, and 60 percent put themselves in the top 10 percent. • College professors: 94 percent rate themselves as doing above-average work. • Engineers: In two different companies, 32 percent and 42 percent rated themselves among the top 5 percent of performers. • Entrepreneurs: When 3,000 small-business owners rated the probability that different companies would succeed, on average they rated the prospects of their own businesses as 8.1 out of 10 but gave similar enterprises odds of only 5.9 out of 10.
   - Location: 551-558
   - Page: 36

14. Overconfidence may be a particularly difficult bias to overcome in the creative domain. When you’re generating a new idea, by definition it’s unique, so you can ignore all the feedback you’ve received in the past about earlier inventions. Even if your previous ideas have bombed, this one is different.
   - Location: 558-560
   - Page: 37

15. To some degree, entrepreneurs and inventors have to be overconfident about the odds of their ideas succeeding, or they wouldn’t have the motivational fuel to pursue them. But even when they do learn about their audience’s preferences, it’s too easy for them to fall victim to what psychologists call confirmation bias: they focus on the strengths of their ideas while ignoring or discounting their limitations.

17. In Justin Berg’s study of circus performances, although circus managers made more accurate forecasts than artists, they still weren’t very good, especially regarding the most novel acts. Managers tend to be too risk averse: they focus on the costs of investing in bad ideas rather than the benefits of piloting good ones, which leads them to commit a large number of false negatives.
   - Location: 643-645
   - Page: 42

18. In the face of uncertainty, our first instinct is often to reject novelty, looking for reasons why unfamiliar concepts might fail. When managers vet novel ideas, they’re in an evaluative mindset. To protect themselves against the risks of a bad bet, they compare the new notion on the table to templates of ideas that have succeeded in the past.
   - Location: 653-655
   - Page: 43

19. So neither test audiences nor managers are ideal judges of creative ideas. They’re too prone to false negatives; they focus too much on reasons to reject an idea and stick too closely to existing prototypes. And we’ve seen that creators struggle as well, because they’re too positive about their own ideas. But there is one group of forecasters that does come close to attaining mastery: fellow creators evaluating one another’s ideas. In Berg’s study of circus acts, the most accurate predictors of whether a video would get liked, shared, and funded were peers evaluating one another.
   - Location: 673-677
   - Page: 44

20. Instead of attempting to assess our own originality or seeking feedback from managers, we ought to turn more often to our colleagues. They lack the risk-aversion of managers and test audiences; they’re open to seeing the potential in unusual possibilities, which guards against false negatives. At the same time, they have no particular investment in our ideas, which gives them enough distance to offer an honest appraisal and protects against false positives.

24. Second, the more the foreign culture differed from that of their native land, the more that experience contributed to the directors’ creativity. An American gained little from working in Canada, compared to the originality dividends of a project in Korea or Japan.
   - Location: 776-778
   - Page: 51

25. The third and most important factor was depth—the amount of time spent working abroad. A short stint did little good, because directors weren’t there long enough to internalize the new ideas from the foreign culture and synthesize them with their old perspectives. The highest originality occurred when directors had spent thirty-five years working abroad.

30. As Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and decision expert Gary Klein explain, intuitions are only trustworthy when people build up experience making judgments in a predictable environment. If you’re confronting a patient’s symptoms as a doctor or entering a burning building as a firefighter, experience will make your intuitions more accurate. There’s a stable, robust relationship between the patterns you’ve seen before and what you encounter today. But if you’re a stockbroker or political forecaster, the events of the past don’t have reliable implications for the present. Kahneman and Klein review evidence that experience helps physicists, accountants, insurance analysts, and chess masters—they all work in fields where cause-and-effect relationships are fairly consistent. But admissions officers, court judges, intelligence analysts, psychiatrists, and stockbrokers didn’t benefit much from experience. In a rapidly changing world, the lessons of experience can easily point us in the wrong direction. And because the pace of change is accelerating, our environments are becoming ever more unpredictable. This makes intuition less reliable as a source of insight about new ideas and places a growing premium on analysis.

For his part, Kamen was lacking the element of passion that helps ideas grow from invention to impact. Instead of being enticed by his passion for creating the Segway, the early investors should have assessed his passion for building a company and bringing the product successfully to market. And to do that, they shouldn’t have only paid attention to what he said. They should have also examined what he did.

35. when you’re pitching a novel idea or speaking up with a suggestion for change, your audience is likely to be skeptical. Investors are looking to poke holes in your arguments; managers are hunting for reasons why your suggestion won’t work. Under those circumstances, for at least four reasons, it’s actually more effective to adopt Griscom’s form of powerless communication by accentuating the flaws in your idea. The first advantage is that leading with weaknesses disarms the audience.

40. A fourth advantage of this approach is that it leaves audiences with a more favorable assessment of the idea itself, due to a bias in how we process information. To illustrate this bias, I often ask executives to judge how happy they are after thinking about the positive features of their lives. One group is tasked with writing three good things about their lives; another group has to list twelve good things. Everyone expects the twelve group to be happier: the more blessings you count, the better you should feel about your circumstances. But most of the time, the opposite is true. We’re happier after we list three good things than twelve. Why would this be? Psychologist Norbert Schwarz has shown that the easier it is to think of something, the more common and important we assume it is. We use ease of retrieval as information. It’s a cinch for executives to come up with three good things about their lives. They immediately list their love of their children, their spouses, and their jobs. Since it was a breeze to generate a few positives, they infer that their lives are pretty darn good. It’s noticeably harder to name twelve good things about their lives. After covering family and work, executives often mention their friends and then ask if they can count each one separately. Having struggled to come up with a dozen good things, they draw the conclusion that their lives aren’t quite so good after all.* This is what happened to investors when Rufus Griscom cited Babble’s weaknesses. By acknowledging its most serious problems, he made it harder for investors to generate their own ideas about what was wrong with the company. And as they found themselves thinking hard to identify other concerns, they decided Babble’s problems weren’t actually that severe.

41. It’s humanly impossible to tap out the rhythm of a song without hearing the tune in your head. That makes it impossible to imagine what your disjointed knocks sound like to an audience that is not hearing the accompanying tune. As Chip and Dan Heath write in Made to Stick, “The listeners can’t hear that tune—all they can hear is a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre Morse Code.” This is the core challenge of speaking up with an original idea. When you present a new suggestion, you’re not only hearing the tune in your head. You wrote the song. You’ve spent hours, days, weeks, months, or maybe even years thinking about the idea. You’ve contemplated the problem, formulated the solution, and rehearsed the vision. You know the lyrics and the melody of your idea by heart. By that point, it’s no longer possible to imagine what it sounds like to an audience that’s listening to it for the first time.

It’s true across different cultures and species; even baby chickens prefer the familiar. My favorite test was when people looked at photographs of themselves and their friends that were either regular or inverted, as if seen in a mirror. We prefer the regular photos of our friends, because that’s how we’re used to seeing them, but we like the inverted photos of ourselves, because that’s how we see ourselves when we look in the mirror. “Familiarity doesn’t breed contempt,”

43. Whether you’re unhappy with your job, your marriage, or your government, decades of research show that you have a choice between exit, voice, persistence, and neglect. Exit means removing yourself from the situation altogether: quitting a miserable job, ending an abusive marriage, or leaving an oppressive country. Voice involves actively trying to improve the situation: approaching your boss with ideas for enriching your job, encouraging your spouse to seek counseling, or becoming a political activist to elect a less corrupt government. Persistence is gritting your teeth and bearing it: working hard even though your job is stifling, sticking by your spouse, or supporting your government even though you disagree with it. Neglect entails staying in the current situation but reducing your effort: doing just enough at work not to get fired, choosing new hobbies that keep you away from your spouse, or refusing to vote.

46. Social scientists have long demonstrated this middle-status conformity effect. If you’re perched at the top, you’re expected to be different and therefore have the license to deviate. Likewise, if you’re still at the bottom of a status hierarchy, you have little to lose and everything to gain by being original. But the middle segment of that hierarchy—where the majority of people in an organization are found—is dominated by insecurity. Now that you have a bit of respect, you value your standing in the group and don’t want to jeopardize it. To maintain and then gain status, you play a game of follow-the-leader, conforming to prove your worth as a group member. As sociologist George Homans observed, “Middle-status conservatism reflects the anxiety experienced by one who aspires to a social station but fears disenfranchisement.” The fall from low to lower hardly hurts; the fall from middle to low is devastating.

49. I don’t mean to imply that it’s never wise to be first. If we all wait for others to act, nothing original will ever be created. Someone has to be the pioneer, and sometimes that will pay off. First-mover advantages tend to prevail when patented technology is involved, or when there are strong network effects (the product or service becomes more valuable when there are a greater number of users, as with telephones or social media). But in the majority of circumstances, your odds of success aren’t higher if you go first. And when the market is uncertain, unknown, or underdeveloped, being a pioneer has pronounced disadvantages. The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to rush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line. Just as procrastinating can give us flexibility on a task, delaying market entry can open us up to learning and adaptability, reducing the risks associated with originality.

52. The time at which we reach our heights of originality, and how long they last, depends on our styles of thinking. When Galenson studied creators, he discovered two radically different styles of innovation: conceptual and experimental. Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it. Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning and evolving as they go along. They are at work on a particular problem, but they don’t have a specific solution in mind at the outset. Instead of planning in advance, they figure it out as they go.

53. Sprinting is a fine strategy for a young genius, but becoming an old master requires the patience of experimentation to run a marathon. Both are paths to creativity. Yet for those of us who aren’t struck by a bolt of insight, slow and steady experimentation can light the way to a longer stretch of originality. “Of course, not every unaccomplished 65-year-old is some undiscovered experimental innovator,” author Daniel Pink reflects. “But it might bolster the resolve of the relentlessly curious, the constantly tinkering, the dedicated tortoises undaunted by the blur of the hares.”

The originals who start a movement will often be its most radical members, whose ideas and ideals will prove too hot for those who follow their lead. To form alliances with opposing groups, it’s best to temper the cause, cooling it as much as possible. Yet to draw allies into joining the cause itself, what’s needed is a moderately tempered message that is neither too hot nor too cold, but just right.

55. Typically, we view our relationships on a continuum from positive to negative. Our closest friends have our backs; our greatest enemies are actively working against us. But research shows that we need to draw two independent axes: one for how positive a relationship is and a separate one for how negative the relationship is. Along with purely positive and wholly negative relationships, we can have connections that are both positive and negative. Psychologists call them ambivalent relationships. You might know them as frenemies—people who sometimes support you and sometimes undermine you.

Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet again, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship. Third, and most important, it is our former adversaries who are the most effective at persuading others to join our movements. They can marshal better arguments on our behalf, because they understand the doubts and misgivings of resisters and fence-sitters.

Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing theirs. It’s hard to change other people’s ideals. It’s much easier to link our agendas to familiar values that people already hold. Second, just as we saw in the case of Meredith Perry’s disguising her real objective of creating wireless power, transparency isn’t always the best policy. As much as they want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals occasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.

If you’re like Robinson, and you consistently challenge the status quo, you operate differently, using instead a logic of appropriateness: What does a person like me do in a situation like this? Rather than looking outward in an attempt to predict the outcome, you turn inward to your identity. You base the decision on who you are—or who you want to be.

61. Niche picking might help to make sense of this mystery. This concept has its roots in the work of the physician and psychotherapist Alfred Adler, who came to believe that Sigmund Freud’s emphasis on parenting failed to account for the critical influence of siblings on personality development. Adler argued that because firstborn children start life as only children, they initially identify with their parents. When a younger sibling arrives, firstborns risk being “dethroned” and often respond by emulating their parents: they enforce rules and assert their authority over the younger sibling, which sets the stage for the younger child to rebel. Faced with the intellectual and physical challenges of competing directly with an older sibling, the younger chooses a different way to stand out. “The niche of the responsible achiever is particularly likely to be open for an eldest child,” Sulloway writes. “Once this niche is taken, it is difficult for a younger sibling to compete effectively for the same niche.”* This depends, of course, on the age distance between siblings. If two children are only a year apart, the younger sibling may be smart enough or strong enough to hold her own; if they’re seven years apart in age, the niche is open again for the younger sibling to participate without having to compete directly.

63. Samuel and Pearl Oliner, a sociologist and an education researcher. They conducted a pioneering study of non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust, comparing these heroic individuals with a group of neighbors who lived in the same towns but did not extend help to Jews. The rescuers had much in common with the bystanders: similar educational backgrounds, occupations, homes, neighborhoods, and political and religious beliefs. They were also equally rebellious in their childhoods—the rescuers were just as likely as the bystanders to be disciplined by their parents for disobeying, stealing, lying, cheating, aggressing, and failing to do what they were told. What differentiated the rescuers was how their parents disciplined bad behavior and praised good behavior.

64. Years ago, researchers found that from ages two to ten, children are urged by their parents to change their behavior once every six to nine minutes. As developmental psychologist Martin Hoffman sums it up, this “translates roughly into 50 discipline encounters a day or over 15,000 a year!” When the Holocaust rescuers recalled their childhoods, they had received a unique form of discipline from their parents. “Explained is the word most rescuers favored,” the Oliners discovered:

65. This rational approach to discipline also characterizes the parents of teenagers who don’t engage in criminal deviance and originals who challenge the orthodoxies of their professions. In one study, parents of ordinary children had an average of six rules, like specific schedules for homework and bedtime. Parents of highly creative children had an average of less than one rule and tended to “place emphasis on moral values, rather than on specific rules,” psychologist Teresa Amabile reports.

When mothers enforce many rules but offer a clear rationale for why they’re important, teenagers are substantially less likely to break them, because they internalize them.

67. There’s a particular kind of explanation that works especially well in enforcing discipline. When the Oliners examined the guidance of the Holocaust rescuers’ parents, they found that they tended to give “explanations of why behaviors are inappropriate, often with reference to their consequences for others.” While the bystanders’ parents focused on enforcing compliance with rules for their own sake, the rescuers’ parents encouraged their children to consider the impact of their actions on others.

68. After children shared some marbles with their peers, a number of them were randomly assigned to have their behavior praised: “It was good that you gave some of your marbles to those poor children. Yes, that was a nice and helpful thing to do.” Others received character praise: “I guess you’re the kind of person who likes to help others whenever you can. Yes, you are a very nice and helpful person.” Children who received character praise were subsequently more generous. Of the children who were complimented for being helpful people, 45 percent gave craft materials to cheer up kids at a hospital two weeks later, compared with only 10 percent of the children who were commended for engaging in helpful behavior. When our character is praised, we internalize it as part of our identities. Instead of seeing ourselves as engaging in isolated moral acts, we start to develop a more unified self-concept as a moral person.

69. But even among very young children, an appeal to character can have an influence in the moment. In an ingenious series of experiments led by psychologist Christopher Bryan, children between ages three and six were 22 percent to 29 percent more likely to clean up blocks, toys, and crayons when they were asked to be helpers instead of to help. Even though their character was far from gelled, they wanted to earn the identity.

70. We can afford to give children a great deal of freedom if we explain the consequences of their actions on others and emphasize how the right moral choices demonstrate good character. This increases the odds that they will develop the instinct to express their original impulses in the form of moral or creative actions, as opposed to deviant ones. But as they grow up, they often don’t aim high enough.

76. What organizational models did they have in mind when they started their companies? Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star, and commitment. The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills: Founders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++, or scientists who had deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins. In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future potential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The individuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular area, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it. Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. Skills and potential were fine, but cultural fit was a must. The top priority was to employ people who matched the company’s values and norms. The commitment blueprint involved a unique approach to motivation, too. Whereas founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and challenging tasks, those with commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees and to the organization. They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in the organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the mission.

When employees are committed to a shared set of goals and values, they can execute effectively in predictable environments. But in volatile settings like the computer, aerospace, and airline industries, the benefits of strong cultures disappear. Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too insular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and they’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently. As a result, they don’t learn and adapt, and don’t have better or more reliable financial results than their competitors.

The company has been consistently praised for its innovative investment strategies, one of which has involved reducing risk by embracing a much greater degree of diversification than typical investment funds. And in the spring of 2007, Bridgewater started warning clients about the impending financial crisis. According to Barron’s, “Nobody was better prepared for the global market crash.” In the investment world, you can only make money if you think different from everyone else. Bridgewater has prevented groupthink by inviting dissenting opinions from every employee in the company. When employees share independent viewpoints instead of conforming to the majority, there’s a much higher chance that Bridgewater will make investment decisions no one else has considered and recognize financial trends no one else has discerned. That makes it possible to be right when the rest of the market is wrong.

Before Google’s people operations team introduces a major change in policy, they often run it by the Canaries for critical feedback.

Defensive pessimists expect the worst, feeling anxious and imagining all the things that can go wrong. If you’re a defensive pessimist, about a week before a big speech you convince yourself that you’re doomed to fail. And it won’t be just ordinary failure: You’ll trip on stage and then forget all your lines. Most people assume it’s better to be a strategic optimist than a defensive pessimist. Yet Norem finds that although defensive pessimists are more anxious and less confident in analytical, verbal, and creative tasks, they perform just as well as strategic optimists. “At first, I asked how these people were able to do so well despite their pessimism,” Norem writes. “Before long, I began to realize that they were doing so well because of their pessimism.”

86. “Defensive pessimism is a strategy used in specific situations to manage anxiety, fear, and worry,” Norem explains. When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be crippled by fear. They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and convert it into motivation. Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering every relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables them to feel a sense of control. Their anxiety reaches its zenith before the event, so that when it arrives, they’re ready to succeed. Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the difficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan. When they don’t feel anxious, they become complacent; when encouraged, they become discouraged from planning. If you want to sabotage the performance of chronic defensive pessimists, just make them happy.

89. According to Berkeley sociologist Arlie Hochschild, if you’re feeling an intense emotion like anxiety or anger, there are two ways to manage it: surface acting and deep acting. Surface acting involves putting on a mask—modifying your speech, gestures, and expressions to present yourself as unfazed. If you’re a flight attendant, and an angry passenger begins yelling at you, you might smile to feign warmth. You’re adjusting your outward appearance, but your internal state is unchanged. You’re furious with the passenger, and the passenger probably knows it. Russian theater director Constantin Stanislavski observed that in surface acting, actors were never fully immersed in the role. They were always aware of the audience, and their performances never came across as authentic. Stanislavski wrote that surface acting “will neither warm your soul nor penetrate deeply into it . . . delicate and deep human feelings are not subject to such technique.” In deep acting, known as method acting in the theater world, you actually become the character you wish to portray. Deep acting involves changing your inner feelings, not just your outer expressions of them. If you’re the flight attendant in the above example, you might imagine that the passenger is stressed, afraid of flying, or going through a messy divorce. You feel empathy for the passenger, and the smile comes naturally to you, creating a more genuine expression of warmth. Deep acting dissolves the distinction between your true self and the role you are playing. You are no longer acting, because you are actually experiencing the genuine feelings of the character.

90. To test whether venting helps with managing anger, psychologist Brad Bushman designed a shrewd experiment to make people angry. The participants were asked to write an essay about whether they were against abortion or pro-choice. They then received some harsh written feedback from a peer with the opposite view, who rated their essays as disorganized, unoriginal, poorly written, unclear, unpersuasive, and low in quality, adding, “This is one of the worst essays I have read!” The angry recipients were then randomly assigned to one of three responses: venting, distraction, or control. The members of the venting group were allowed to hit a punching bag as hard as they wanted for as long as they liked, while thinking about the jerk who criticized their essays and looking at his picture. The distraction group hit the punching bag but was instructed to think about becoming physically fit, and was shown a photo of someone exercising. In the control group, there was no punching bag; participants sat quietly for two minutes while the computer was being fixed. Which group would become the most aggressive toward the peer who insulted them? To find out, Bushman gave each of the groups the chance to blast their essay’s critic with noise, letting them determine the volume and duration of the sonic blasts. The venting group was the most aggressive. They slammed the critic with more intense noise, and held the button down longer, than the distraction and control groups. One participant got so angry after thinking about the insulting feedback that hitting the punching bag wasn’t enough: he punched a hole in the wall of the lab. Venting doesn’t extinguish the flame of anger; it feeds it. When we vent our anger, we put a lead foot on the gas pedal of the go system, attacking the target who enraged us. Hitting the punching bag without thinking of the target, though, keeps the go system on but enables us to consider alternative ways of responding. Sitting quietly begins to activate the stop system.

92. As you probably anticipated, this doesn’t work if you’re pitching a bad idea. Stanford psychologist Zak Tormala finds that audiences are more convinced when experts express doubt than certainty, due to the element of surprise. We expect an entrepreneur or a change agent to be certain. When they’re not, we’re intrigued, and we pay more attention to the message—which means we’ll get on board if the idea is compelling. The Sarick Effect only holds if you have a persuasive message to deliver.

## The Best Time Travel Stories of the 20th Century
**Author:** Martin H. Greenberg;Harry Turtledove

### Highlights (1)

1. Childhood’s End, his elegiac novel on humankind’s maturation as a species and ascent to a greater purpose in the universal scheme. Clarke grounds the cosmic mystery of these stories in hard science. Degreed in physics and mathematics, Clarke was a contributor to numerous scientific journals and first proposed the idea for the geosynchronous orbiting communications satellite in 1945. Some of his best known work centers around the solution to a scientific problem or enigma. A Fall of Moondust tells of efforts to rescue a ship trapped under unusual conditions on the lunar surface. The Fountains of Paradise concerns the engineering problems encountered building an earth elevator to supply orbiting space stations. His Hugo- and Nebula Award–winning Rendezvous with Rama extrapolated his solid scientific inquiry into provocative new territory, telling of the human discovery of an apparently abandoned alien space ship and human attempts to understand its advanced scientific principles. Clarke’s other novels include Prelude to Space, The Sands of Mars, Earthlight, Imperial Earth, and The Deep Range, a futuristic exploration of undersea life in terms similar to his speculations on space travel. He has written the novels Islands in the Sky and Dolphin Island for young readers, and his short fiction has been collected in Expedition to Earth, Reach for Tomorrow, Tales from the White Hart, The Wind from the Sun, and others. His numerous books of nonfiction include his award-winning The Exploration of Space, and the autobiographical Astounding Days. Clarke was knighted in 2000.

## The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses
**Author:** Eric Ries

### Highlights (113)

1. a new movement of entrepreneurs around the world. It builds on many previous management and product development ideas, including lean manufacturing, design thinking, customer development, and agile development. It represents a new approach to creating continuous innovation. It’s called the Lean Startup.
   - Location: 129-131
   - Page: 9

2. Back in 2004, Steve had just begun preaching a new idea: the business and marketing functions of a startup should be considered as important as engineering and product development and therefore deserve an equally rigorous methodology to guide them. He called that methodology Customer Development, and it offered insight and guidance to my daily work as an entrepreneur.
   - Location: 143-146
   - Page: 10

3. my definition of a startup: a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.
   - Location: 181-182
   - Page: 12

4. Entrepreneurship is management. A startup is an institution, not just a product, and so it requires a new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty.
   - Location: 183-185
   - Page: 12

5. Validated learning. Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision.
   - Location: 186-188
   - Page: 13

6. Build-Measure-Learn. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop.
   - Location: 189-190
   - Page: 13

7. Innovation accounting. To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups—and the people who hold them accountable.

8. The first problem is the allure of a good plan, a solid strategy, and thorough market research. In earlier eras, these things were indicators of likely success. The overwhelming temptation is to apply them to startups too, but this doesn’t work, because startups operate with too much uncertainty.
   - Location: 194-196
   - Page: 13

9. The second problem is that after seeing traditional management fail to solve this problem, some entrepreneurs and investors have thrown up their hands and adopted the “Just Do It” school of startups.

10. The Lean Startup takes its name from the lean manufacturing revolution that Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo are credited with developing at Toyota. Lean thinking is radically altering the way supply chains and production systems are run. Among its tenets are drawing on the knowledge and creativity of individual workers, the shrinking of batch sizes, just-in-time production and inventory control, and an acceleration of cycle times. It taught the world the difference between value-creating activities and waste and showed how to build quality into products from the inside out.

11. A comprehensive theory of entrepreneurship should address all the functions of an early-stage venture: vision and concept, product development, marketing and sales, scaling up, partnerships and distribution, and structure and organizational design. It has to provide a method for measuring progress in the context of extreme uncertainty. It can give entrepreneurs clear guidance on how to make the many trade-off decisions they face: whether and when to invest in process; formulating, planning, and creating infrastructure; when to go it alone and when to partner; when to respond to feedback and when to stick with vision; and how and when to invest in scaling the business. Most of all, it must allow entrepreneurs to make testable predictions.

12. When people are used to evaluating their productivity locally, they feel that a good day is one in which they did their job well all day. When I worked as a programmer, that meant eight straight hours of programming without interruption. That was a good day. In contrast, if I was interrupted with questions, process, or—heaven forbid—meetings, I felt bad. What did I really accomplish that day? Code and product features were tangible to me; I could see them, understand them, and show them off. Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible. The Lean Startup asks people to start measuring their productivity differently. Because startups often accidentally build something nobody wants, it doesn’t matter much if they do it on time and on budget. The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible. In other words, the Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time.

13. Before Henry Ford was a famous CEO, he was an engineer. He spent his days and nights tinkering in his garage with the precise mechanics of getting the engine cylinders to move. Each tiny explosion within the cylinder provides the motive force to turn the wheels but also drives the ignition of the next explosion. Unless the timing of this feedback loop is managed precisely, the engine will sputter and break down. Startups have a similar engine that I call the engine of growth. The markets and customers for startups are diverse: a toy company, a consulting firm, and a manufacturing plant may not seem like they have much in common, but, as we’ll see, they operate with the same engine of growth. Every new version of a product, every new feature, and every new marketing program is an attempt to improve this engine of growth. Like Henry Ford’s tinkering in his garage, not all of these changes turn out to be improvements.

14. The Lean Startup method, in contrast, is designed to teach you how to drive a startup. Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Through this process of steering, we can learn when and if it’s time to make a sharp turn called a pivot or whether we should persevere along our current path. Once we have an engine that’s revved up, the Lean Startup offers methods to scale and grow the business with maximum acceleration.

15. Startups also have a true north, a destination in mind: creating a thriving and world-changing business. I call that a startup’s vision. To achieve that vision, startups employ a strategy, which includes a business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners and competitors, and ideas about who the customer will be. The product is the end result of this strategy (see the chart on this page). Products change constantly through the process of optimization, what I call tuning the engine. Less frequently, the strategy may have to change (called a pivot). However, the overarching vision rarely changes.

16. A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

17. We often lose sight of the fact that a startup is not just about a product, a technological breakthrough, or even a brilliant idea. A startup is greater than the sum of its parts; it is an acutely human enterprise. The fact that a startup’s product or service is a new innovation is also an essential part of the definition and a tricky part too. I prefer to use the broadest definition of product, one that encompasses any source of value for the people who become customers. Anything those customers experience from their interaction with a company should be considered part of that company’s product. This is true of a grocery store, an e-commerce website, a consulting service, and a nonprofit social service agency. In every case, the organization is dedicated to uncovering a new source of value for customers and cares about
   - Location: 378-384

18. It’s also important that the word innovation be understood broadly. Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new business model that unlocks value that was hidden, or simply bringing a product or service to a new location or a previously underserved set of customers.

19. “Boy, the amount of learning they get is just immense now. And what it does is develop entrepreneurs, because when you have only one test, you don’t have entrepreneurs, you have politicians, because you have to sell. Out of a hundred good ideas, you’ve got to sell your idea. So you build up a society of politicians and salespeople. When you have five hundred tests you’re running, then everybody’s ideas can run. And then you create entrepreneurs who run and learn and can retest and relearn as opposed to a society of politicians. So we’re trying to drive that throughout our organization, using examples which have nothing to do with high tech, like the website example. Every business today has a website. You don’t have to be high tech to use fast-cycle testing.”

20. The amount of time a company can count on holding on to market leadership to exploit its earlier innovations is shrinking, and this creates an imperative for even the most entrenched companies to invest in innovation. In fact, I believe a company’s only sustainable path to long-term economic growth is to build an “innovation factory” that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive innovations on a continuous basis.

22. Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere.

24. But in a startup, who the customer is and what the customer might find valuable are unknown, part of the very uncertainty that is an essential part of the definition of a startup.
   - Location: 648-649
   - Page: 43

25. I’ve come to believe that learning is the essential unit of progress for startups. The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this validated learning because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup’s core metrics.
   - Location: 665-667
   - Page: 44

26. The Lean Startup methodology reconceives a startup’s efforts as experiments that test its strategy to see which parts are brilliant and which are crazy. A true experiment follows the scientific method. It begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what is supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirically. Just as scientific experimentation is informed by theory, startup experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of every startup experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable business around that vision.

One of its landmark provisions created a new federal agency, the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau (CFPB). This agency is tasked with protecting American citizens from predatory lending by financial services companies such as credit card companies, student lenders, and payday loan offices.

30. startup. President Obama tasked his chief technology officer, Aneesh Chopra, with collecting ideas for how to set up the new startup agency, and that is how I came to be involved. On one of Chopra’s visits to Silicon Valley, he invited a number of entrepreneurs to make suggestions for ways to cultivate a startup mentality in the new agency. In particular, his focus was on leveraging technology and innovation to make the agency more efficient, cost-effective, and thorough. My suggestion was drawn straight from the principles of this chapter: treat the CFPB as an experiment, identify the elements of the plan that are assumptions rather than facts, and figure out ways to test them. Using these insights, we could build a minimum viable product and have the agency up and running—on a micro scale—long before the official plan was set in motion.
   - Location: 937-943
   - Page: 62

31. The number one assumption underlying the current plan is that once Americans know they can call the CFPB for help with financial fraud and abuse, there will be a significant volume of citizens who do that. This sounds reasonable, as it is based on market research about the amount of fraud that affects Americans each year. However, despite all that research, it is still an assumption. If the actual call volume differs markedly from that in the plan, it will require significant revision. What if Americans who are subjected to financial abuse don’t view themselves as victims and therefore don’t seek help? What if they have very different notions of what problems are important? What if they call the agency seeking help for problems that are outside its purview? Once the agency is up and running with a $500 million budget and a correspondingly large staff, altering the plan will be expensive and time-consuming, but why wait to get feedback? To start experimenting immediately, the agency could start with the creation of a simple hotline number, using one of the new breed of low-cost and fast setup platforms such as Twilio. With a few hours’ work, they could add simple voice prompts, offering callers a menu of financial problems to choose from. In the first version, the prompts could be drawn straight from the existing research. Instead of a caseworker on the line, each prompt could offer the caller useful information about how to solve her or his problem.

32. challenge is to overcome the prevailing management thinking that puts its faith in well-researched plans. Remember, planning is a tool that only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history. And yet, do any of us feel that the world around us is getting more and more stable every day? Changing such a mind-set is hard but critical to startup success.

33. Startups need extensive contact with potential customers to understand them, so get out of your chair and get to know them. The first step in this process is to confirm that your leap-of-faith questions are based in reality, that the customer has a significant problem worth solving.8

34. we understand our potential customer and what problems they have. With that understanding, we can craft a customer archetype, a brief document that seeks to humanize the proposed target customer. This archetype is an essential guide for product development and
   - Location: 1179-1180
   - Page: 77

35. There are many techniques for building an accurate customer archetype that have been developed over long years of practice in the design community. Traditional approaches such as interaction design or design thinking are enormously helpful. To me, it has always seemed ironic that many of these approaches are highly experimental and iterative, using techniques such as rapid prototyping and in-person customer observations to guide designers’ work. Yet because of the way design agencies traditionally have been compensated, all this work culminates in a monolithic deliverable to the client. All of a sudden, the rapid learning and experimentation stops; the assumption is that the designers have learned all there is to know. For startups, this is an unworkable model. No amount of design can anticipate the many complexities of bringing a product to life in the real world. In fact, a new breed of designers is developing brand-new techniques under the banner of Lean User Experience (Lean UX). They recognize that the customer archetype is a hypothesis, not a fact. The customer profile should be considered provisional until the strategy has shown via validated learning that we can serve this type of customer in a sustainable way.10

36. ANALYSIS PARALYSIS There are two ever-present dangers when entrepreneurs conduct market research and talk to customers. Followers of the just-do-it school of entrepreneurship are impatient to get started and don’t want to spend time analyzing their strategy. They’d rather start building immediately, often after just a few cursory customer conversations. Unfortunately, because customers don’t really know what they want, it’s easy for these entrepreneurs to delude themselves that they are on the right path. Other entrepreneurs can fall victim to analysis paralysis, endlessly refining their plans. In this case, talking to customers, reading research reports, and whiteboard strategizing are all equally unhelpful. The problem with most entrepreneurs’ plans is generally not that they don’t follow sound strategic principles but that the facts upon which they are based are wrong. Unfortunately, most of these errors cannot be detected at the whiteboard because they depend on the subtle interactions between products and customers.
   - Location: 1191-1199

37. If too much analysis is dangerous but none can lead to failure, how do entrepreneurs know when to stop analyzing and start building? The answer is a concept called the minimum viable product,

Its goal was to bring people together to solve problems they couldn’t solve on their own, such as fund-raising for a cause or boycotting a certain retailer. The Point’s early results were disappointing, however, and at the end of 2008 the founders decided to try something new.

39. A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.3 It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. Contrary to traditional product development, which usually involves a long, thoughtful incubation period and strives for product perfection, the goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it. Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.
   - Location: 1223-1229
   - Page: 80

40. Minimum viable products range in complexity from extremely simple smoke tests (little more than an advertisement) to actual early prototypes complete with problems and missing features. Deciding exactly how complex an MVP needs to be cannot be done formulaically. It requires judgment. Luckily, this judgment is not difficult to develop: most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify.

45. the most common objection I have heard over the years to building an MVP is fear of competitors—especially large established companies—stealing a startup’s ideas. If only it were so easy to have a good idea stolen! Part of the special challenge of being a startup is the near impossibility of having your idea, company, or product be noticed by anyone, let alone a competitor. In fact, I have often given entrepreneurs fearful of this issue the following assignment: take one of your ideas (one of your lesser insights, perhaps), find the name of the relevant product manager at an established company who has responsibility for that area, and try to get that company to steal your idea. Call them up, write them a memo, send them a press release—go ahead, try it. The truth is that most managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good ideas. Their challenge lies in prioritization and execution, and it is those challenges that give a startup hope of surviving.10
   - Location: 1469-1476
   - Page: 96

46. The reason to build a new team to pursue an idea is that you believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If that’s true, it makes no difference what the competition knows. If it’s not true, a startup has much bigger problems, and secrecy won’t fix them. Sooner or later, a successful startup will face competition from fast followers. A head start is rarely large enough to matter, and time spent in stealth mode—away from customers—is unlikely to provide a head start. The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.

47. helps to prepare for the fact that MVPs often result in bad news. Unlike traditional concept tests or prototypes, they are designed to speak to the full range of business questions, not just design or technical ones, and they often provide a needed dose of reality. In fact, piercing the reality distortion field is quite uncomfortable. Visionaries are especially afraid of a false negative: that customers will reject a flawed MVP that is too small or too limited. It is precisely this attitude that one sees when companies launch fully formed products without prior testing. They simply couldn’t bear to test them in anything less than their full splendor. Yet there is wisdom in the visionary’s fear. Teams steeped in traditional product development methods are trained to make go/kill decisions on a regular basis. That is the essence of the waterfall or stage-gate development model. If an MVP fails, teams are liable to give up hope and abandon the project altogether.

48. HOW INNOVATION ACCOUNTING WORKS—THREE LEARNING MILESTONES Innovation accounting works in three steps: first, use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now. Without a clear-eyed picture of your current status—no matter how far from the goal you may be—you cannot begin to track your progress. Second, startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. This may take many attempts. After the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimizations it can to move its baseline toward the ideal, the company reaches a decision point. That is the third step: pivot or persevere. If the company is making good progress toward the ideal, that means it’s learning appropriately and using that learning effectively, in which case it makes sense to continue. If not, the management team eventually must conclude that its current product strategy is flawed and needs a serious change. When a company pivots, it starts the process all over again, reestablishing a new baseline and then tuning the engine from there. The sign of a successful pivot is that these engine-tuning activities are more productive after the pivot than before.
   - Location: 1559-1568
   - Page: 102

49. Establish the Baseline For example, a startup might create a complete prototype of its product and offer to sell it to real customers through its main marketing channel. This single MVP would test most of the startup’s assumptions and establish baseline metrics for each assumption simultaneously. Alternatively, a startup might prefer to build separate MVPs that are aimed at getting feedback on one assumption at a time. Before building the prototype, the company might perform a smoke test with its marketing materials. This is an old direct marketing technique in which customers are given the opportunity to preorder a product that has not yet been built. A smoke test measures only one thing: whether customers are interested in trying a product. By itself, this is insufficient to validate an entire growth model. Nonetheless, it can be very useful to get feedback on this assumption before committing more money and other resources to the product.

50. Tuning the Engine Once the baseline has been established, the startup can work toward the second learning milestone: tuning the engine. Every product development, marketing, or other initiative that a startup undertakes should be targeted at improving one of the drivers of its growth model. For example, a company might spend time improving the design of its product to make it easier for new customers to use. This presupposes that the activation rate of new customers is a driver of growth and that its baseline is lower than the company would like. To demonstrate validated learning, the design changes must improve the activation rate of new customers. If they do not, the new design should be judged a failure. This is an important rule: a good design is one that changes customer behavior for the better.

51. Pivot or Persevere Over time, a team that is learning its way toward a sustainable business will see the numbers in its model rise from the horrible baseline established by the MVP and converge to something like the ideal one established in the business plan. A startup that fails to do so will see that ideal recede ever farther into the distance. When this is done right, even the most powerful reality distortion field won’t be able to cover up this simple fact: if we’re not moving the drivers of our business model, we’re not making progress. That becomes a sure sign that it’s time to pivot.

52. grand bargain of agile development: engineers agree to adapt the product to the business’s constantly changing requirements but are not responsible for the quality of those business decisions. Agile is an efficient system of development from the point of view of the developers. It allows them to stay focused on creating features and technical designs.

53. Grockit changed the metrics they used to evaluate success in two ways. Instead of looking at gross metrics, Grockit switched to cohort-based metrics, and instead of looking for cause-and-effect relationships after the fact, Grockit would launch each new feature as a true split-test experiment. A split-test experiment is one in which different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time.

54. Split testing often uncovers surprising things. For example, many features that make the product better in the eyes of engineers and designers have no impact on customer behavior. This was the case at Grockit, as it has been in every company I have seen adopt this technique. Although working with split tests seems to be more difficult because it requires extra accounting and metrics to keep track of each variation, it almost always saves tremendous amounts of time in the long run by eliminating work that doesn’t matter to customers.

55. Following the lean manufacturing principle of kanban, or capacity constraint, Grockit changed the product prioritization process. Under the new system, user stories were not considered complete until they led to validated learning. Thus, stories could be cataloged as being in one of four states of development: in the product backlog, actively being built, done (feature complete from a technical point of view), or in the process of being validated.

56. Actionable For a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Otherwise, it is a vanity metric. The reports that Grockit’s team began to use to judge their learning milestones made it extremely clear what actions would be necessary to replicate the results. By contrast, vanity metrics fail this criterion.

57. Accessible All too many reports are not understood by the employees and managers who are supposed to use them to guide their decision making. Unfortunately, most managers do not respond to this complexity by working hand in hand with the data warehousing team to simplify the reports so that they can understand them better. Departments too often spend their energy learning how to use data to get what they want rather than as genuine feedback to guide their future actions.

58. are we making sufficient progress to believe that our original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to make a major change? That change is called a pivot: a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth.

59. My goal in advocating a scientific approach to the creation of startups is to channel human creativity into its most productive form, and there is no bigger destroyer of creative potential than the misguided decision to persevere. Companies that cannot bring themselves to pivot to a new direction on the basis of feedback from the marketplace can get stuck in the land of the living dead, neither growing enough nor dying, consuming resources and commitment from employees and other stakeholders but not moving ahead. There is good news about our reliance on judgment, though. We are able to learn, we are innately creative, and we have a remarkable ability to see the signal in the noise. In fact, we are so good at this that sometimes we see signals that aren’t there. The heart of the scientific method is the realization that although human judgment may be faulty, we can improve our judgment by subjecting our theories to repeated testing. Startup productivity is not about cranking out more widgets or features. It is about aligning our efforts with a business and product that are working to create value and drive growth. In other words, successful pivots put us on a path toward growing a sustainable business.

60. The decision to pivot is emotionally charged for any startup and has to be addressed in a structured way. One way to mitigate this challenge is to schedule the meeting in advance. I recommend that every startup have a regular “pivot or persevere” meeting. In my experience, less than a few weeks between meetings is too often and more than a few months is too infrequent. However, each startup needs to find its own pace.

61. Remember that the rationale for building low-quality MVPs is that developing any features beyond what early adopters require is a form of waste. However, the logic of this takes you only so far. Once you have found success with early adopters, you want to sell to mainstream customers. Mainstream customers have different requirements and are much more demanding.

62. Pivots come in different flavors. The word pivot sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for change. A pivot is a special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.

64. Zoom-out Pivot In the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insufficient to support a whole product. In this type of pivot, what was considered the whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product.

65. Customer Segment Pivot In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it is building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the type of customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is partially confirmed, solving the right problem, but for a different customer than originally anticipated.

66. Customer Need Pivot As a result of getting to know customers extremely well, it sometimes becomes clear that the problem we’re trying to solve for them is not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we often discover other related problems that are important and can be solved by our team. In many cases, these related problems may require little more than repositioning the existing product. In other cases, it may require a completely new product. Again, this a case where the product hypothesis is partially confirmed; the target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the one that was originally anticipated. A famous example is the chain Potbelly Sandwich Shop, which today has over two hundred stores. It began as an antique store in 1977; the owners started to sell sandwiches as a way to bolster traffic to their stores. Pretty soon they had pivoted their way into an entirely different line of business.

67. Platform Pivot A platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new platform begin life by selling a single application, the so-called killer app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their own related products. However, this order is not always set in stone, and some companies have to execute this pivot multiple times.

68. Business Architecture Pivot This pivot borrows a concept from Geoffrey Moore, who observed that companies generally follow one of two major business architectures: high margin, low volume (complex systems model) or low margin, high volume (volume operations model).6 The former commonly is associated with business to business (B2B) or enterprise sales cycles, and the latter with consumer products (there are notable exceptions). In a business architecture pivot, a startup switches architectures. Some companies change from high margin, low volume by going mass market (e.g., Google’s search “appliance”); others, originally designed for the mass market, turned out to require long and expensive sales cycles.

69. Value Capture Pivot There are many ways to capture the value a company creates. These methods are referred to commonly as monetization or revenue models. These terms are much too limiting. Implicit in the idea of monetization is that it is a separate “feature” of a product that can be added or removed at will. In reality, capturing value is an intrinsic part of the product hypothesis. Often, changes to the way a company captures value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the business, product, and marketing strategies.

70. Engine of Growth Pivot As we’ll see in Chapter 10, there are three primary engines of growth that power startups: the viral, sticky, and paid growth models. In this type of pivot, a company changes its growth strategy to seek faster or more profitable growth. Commonly but not always, the engine of growth also requires a change in the way value is captured.

71. Channel Pivot In traditional sales terminology, the mechanism by which a company delivers its product to customers is called the sales channel or distribution channel. For example, consumer packaged goods are sold in a grocery store, cars are sold in dealerships, and much enterprise software is sold (with extensive customization) by consulting and professional services firms. Often, the requirements of the channel determine the price, features, and competitive landscape of a product. A channel pivot is a recognition that the same basic solution could be delivered through a different channel with greater effectiveness. Whenever a company abandons a previously complex sales process to “sell direct” to its end users, a channel pivot is in progress. It is precisely because of its destructive effect on sales channels that the Internet has had such a disruptive influence in industries that previously required complex sales and distribution channels, such as newspaper, magazine, and book publishing.

72. Technology Pivot Occasionally, a company discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a completely different technology. Technology pivots are much more common in established businesses. In other words, they are a sustaining innovation, an incremental improvement designed to appeal to and retain an existing customer base. Established companies excel at this kind of pivot because so much is not changing. The customer segment is the same, the customer’s problem is the same, the value-capture model is the same, and the channel partners are the same. The only question is whether the new technology can provide superior price and/or performance compared with the existing technology.

73. BATCH In the book Lean Thinking, James Womack and Daniel Jones recount a story of stuffing newsletters into envelopes with the assistance of one of the author’s two young children. Every envelope had to be addressed, stamped, filled with a letter, and sealed. The daughters, age six and nine, knew how they should go about completing the project: “Daddy, first you should fold all of the newsletters. Then you should attach the seal. Then you should put on the stamps.” Their father wanted to do it the counterintuitive way: complete each envelope one at a time. They—like most of us—thought that was backward, explaining to him “that wouldn’t be efficient!” He and his daughters each took half the envelopes and competed to see who would finish first. The father won the race, and not just because he is an adult. It happened because the one envelope at a time approach is a faster way of getting the job done even though it seems inefficient. This has been confirmed in many studies, including one that was recorded on video.1 The one envelope at a time approach is called “single-piece flow” in lean manufacturing. It works because of the surprising power of small batches. When we do work that proceeds in stages, the “batch size” refers to how much work moves from one stage to the next at a time. For example, if we were stuffing one hundred envelopes, the intuitive way to do it—folding one hundred letters at a time—would have a batch size of one hundred. Single-piece flow is so named because it has a batch size of one. Why does stuffing one envelope at a time get the job done faster even though it seems like it would be slower? Because our intuition doesn’t take into account the extra time required to sort, stack, and move around the large piles of half-complete envelopes when it’s done the other way.2 It seems more efficient to repeat the same task over and over, in part because we expect that we will get better at this simple task the more we do it. Unfortunately, in process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system. Even if the amount of time that each process took was exactly the same, the small batch production approach still would be superior, and for even more counterintuitive reasons. For example, imagine that the letters didn’t fit in the envelopes. With the large-batch approach, we wouldn’t find that out until nearly the end. With small batches, we’d know almost immediately. What if the envelopes are defective and won’t seal? In the large-batch approach, we’d have to unstuff all the envelopes, get new ones, and restuff them. In the small-batch approach, we’d find this out immediately and have no rework required. All these issues are visible in a process as simple as stuffing envelopes, but they are of real and much greater consequence in the work of every company, large or small. The small-batch approach produces a finished product every few seconds, whereas the large-batch approach must deliver all the products at once, at the end. Imagine what this might look like if the time horizon was hours, days, or weeks. What if it turns out that the customers have decided they don’t want the product? Which process would allow a company to find this out sooner?

76. many high-tech products are manufactured in advanced facilities that follow the latest in lean thinking, including small batches and single-piece flow. However, the process that is used to design the product is stuck in the era of mass production. Think of all the changes that are made to a product such as the iPhone; all 1,500 of them are released to customers in one giant batch. Behind the scenes, in the development and design of the product itself, large batches are still the rule. The work that goes into the development of a new product proceeds on a virtual assembly line. Product managers figure out what features are likely to please customers; product designers then figure out how those features should look and feel. These designs are passed to engineering, which builds something new or modifies an existing product and, once this is done, hands it off to somebody responsible for verifying that the new product works the way the product managers and designers intended.

77. IMVU used an elaborate set of defense mechanisms that prevented engineers from accidentally breaking something important. We called this our product’s immune system because those automatic protections went beyond checking that the product behaved as expected. We also continuously monitored the health of our business itself so that mistakes were found and removed automatically. Going back to our business-to-hobby example of the missing checkout button, let’s make the problem a little more interesting. Imagine that instead of removing the button altogether, an engineer makes a mistake and changes the button’s color so that it is now white on a white background. From the point of view of automated functional tests, the button is still there and everything is working normally; from the customer’s point of view, the button is gone, and so nobody can buy anything. This class of problems is hard to detect solely with automation but is still catastrophic from a business point of view. At IMVU, our immune system is programmed to detect these business consequences and automatically invoke our equivalent of the andon cord. When our immune system detects a problem, a number of things happen immediately: 1. The defective change is removed immediately and automatically. 2. Everyone on the relevant team is notified of the problem. 3. The team is blocked from introducing any further changes, preventing the problem from being compounded by future mistakes … 4. … until the root cause of the problem is found and fixed. (This root cause analysis is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 11.)

78. At IMVU, we called this continuous deployment, and even in the fast-moving world of software development it is still considered controversial.3 As the Lean Startup movement has gained traction, it has come to be embraced by more and more startups, even those that operate mission-critical applications. Among the most cutting edge examples is Wealthfront, whose pivot was described in Chapter 8. The company practices true continuous deployment—including more than a dozen releases to customers every day—in an SEC-regulated environment.4

81. Hospital lab blood collections often are done in hourly batches; phlebotomists collect blood for an hour from multiple patients and then send or take all the samples to the lab. This adds to turnaround time for test results and can harm test quality. It has become common for hospitals to bring small batches (two patients) or a single-patient flow of specimens to the lab even if they have to hire an extra phlebotomist or two to do so, because the total system cost is lower.

   - Page: 175

83. As soon as we formulate a hypothesis that we want to test, the product development team should be engineered to design and run this experiment as quickly as possible, using the smallest batch size that will get the job done. Remember that although we write the feedback loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our planning really works in the reverse order: we figure out what we need to learn and then work backwards to see what product will work as an experiment to get that learning. Thus, it is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is waste.

84. THE STARTUP WAY

85. WHERE DOES GROWTH COME FROM? The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth. I use the word sustainable to exclude all one-time activities that generate a surge of customers but have no long-term impact, such as a single advertisement or a publicity stunt that might be used to jump-start growth but could not sustain that growth for the long term. Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers.
   - Location: 2747-2751
   - Page: 180

86. There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth: 1. Word of mouth. Embedded in most products is a natural level of growth that is caused by satisfied customers’ enthusiasm for the product. For example, when I bought my first TiVo DVR, I couldn’t stop telling my friends and family about it. Pretty soon, my entire family was using one. 2. As a side effect of product usage. Fashion or status, such as luxury goods products, drive awareness of themselves whenever they are used. When you see someone dressed in the latest clothes or driving a certain car, you may be influenced to buy that product. This is also true of so-called viral products such as Facebook and PayPal. When a customer sends money to a friend using PayPal, the friend is exposed automatically to the PayPal product. 3. Through funded advertising. Most businesses employ advertising to entice new customers to use their products. For this to be a source of sustainable growth, the advertising must be paid for out of revenue, not one-time sources such as investment capital. As long as the cost of acquiring a new customer (the so-called marginal cost) is less than the revenue that customer generates (the marginal revenue), the excess (the marginal profit) can be used to acquire more customers. The more marginal profit, the faster the growth. 4. Through repeat purchase or use. Some products are designed to be purchased repeatedly either through a subscription plan (a cable company) or through voluntary repurchases (groceries or lightbulbs). By contrast, many products and services are intentionally designed as one-time events, such as wedding planning. These sources of sustainable growth power feedback loops that I have termed engines of growth. Each is like a combustion engine, turning over and over. The faster the loop turns, the faster the company will grow. Each engine has an intrinsic set of metrics that determine how fast a company can grow when using it.

89. The Paid Engine of Growth
   - Location: 2854-2854
   - Page: 187

90. Like the other engines, the paid engine of growth is powered by a feedback loop. Each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product over his or her “lifetime” as a customer. Once variable costs are deducted, this usually is called the customer lifetime value (LTV). This revenue can be invested in growth by buying advertising. Suppose an advertisement costs $100 and causes fifty new customers to sign up for the service. This ad has a cost per acquisition (CPA) of $2.00. In this example, if the product has an LTV that is greater than $2, the product will grow. The margin between the LTV and the CPA determines how fast the paid engine of growth will turn (this is called the marginal profit). Conversely, if the CPA remains at $2.00 but the LTV falls below $2.00, the company’s growth will slow. It may make up the difference with one-time tactics such as using invested capital or publicity stunts, but those tactics are not sustainable. This was the fate of many failed companies, including notable dot-com flameouts that erroneously believed that they could lose money on each customer but, as the old joke goes, make it up in volume.
   - Location: 2871-2879
   - Page: 188

91. A Technical Caveat Technically, more than one engine of growth can operate in a business at a time. For example, there are products that have extremely fast viral growth as well as extremely low customer churn rates. Also, there is no reason why a product cannot have both high margins and high retention. However, in my experience, successful startups usually focus on just one engine of growth, specializing in everything that is required to make it work. Companies that attempt to build a dashboard that includes all three engines tend to cause a lot of confusion because the operations expertise required to model all these effects simultaneously is quite complicated. Therefore, I strongly recommend that startups focus on one engine at a time. Most entrepreneurs already have a strong leap-of-faith hypothesis about which engine is most likely to work. If they do not, time spent out of the building with customers will quickly suggest one that seems profitable. Only after pursuing one engine thoroughly should a startup consider a pivot to one of the others.

92. This is the same problem that established companies experience. Their past successes were built on a finely tuned engine of growth. If that engine runs its course and growth slows or stops, there can be a crisis if the company does not have new startups incubating within its ranks that can provide new sources of growth.

94. THE WISDOM OF THE FIVE WHYS To accelerate, Lean Startups need a process that provides a natural feedback loop. When you’re going too fast, you cause more problems. Adaptive processes force you to slow down and invest in preventing the kinds of problems that are currently wasting time. As those preventive efforts pay off, you naturally speed up again. Let’s return to the question of having a training program for new employees. Without a program, new employees will make mistakes while in their learning curve that will require assistance and intervention from other team members, slowing everyone down. How do you decide if the investment in training is worth the benefit of speed due to reduced interruptions? Figuring this out from a top-down perspective is challenging, because it requires estimating two completely unknown quantities: how much it will cost to build an unknown program against an unknown benefit you might reap. Even worse, the traditional way to make these kinds of decisions is decidedly large-batch thinking. A company either has an elaborate training program or it does not. Until they can justify the return on investment from building a full program, most companies generally do nothing. The alternative is to use a system called the Five Whys to make incremental investments and evolve a startup’s processes gradually. The core idea of Five Whys is to tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms. The system takes its name from the investigative method of asking the question “Why?” five times to understand what has happened (the root cause). If you’ve ever had to answer a precocious child who wants to know “Why is the sky blue?” and keeps asking “Why?” after each answer, you’re familiar with it. This technique was developed as a systematic problem-solving tool by Taiichi Ohno, the father of the Toyota Production System. I have adapted it for use in the Lean Startup model with a few changes designed specifically for startups. At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem. Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be. Taiichi Ohno gives the following example: When confronted with a problem, have you ever stopped and asked why five times? It is difficult to do even though it sounds easy. For example, suppose a machine stopped functioning: 1. Why did the machine stop? (There was an overload and the fuse blew.) 2. Why was there an overload? (The bearing was not sufficiently lubricated.) 3. Why was it not lubricated sufficiently? (The lubrication pump was not pumping sufficiently.) 4. Why was it not pumping sufficiently? (The shaft of the pump was worn and rattling.) 5. Why was the shaft worn out? (There was no strainer attached and metal scrap got in.) Repeating “why” five times, like this, can help uncover the root problem and correct it. If this procedure were not carried through, one might simply replace the fuse or the pump shaft. In that case, the problem would recur within a few months. The Toyota production system has been built on the practice and evolution of this scientific approach. By asking and answering “why” five times, we can get to the real cause of the problem, which is often hidden behind more obvious symptoms.1 Note that even in Ohno’s relatively simple example the root cause moves away from a technical fault (a blown fuse) and toward a human error (someone forgot to attach a strainer). This is completely typical of most problems that startups face no matter what industry they are in. Going back to our service business example, most problems that at first appear to be individual mistakes can be traced back to problems in training or the original playbook for how the service is to be delivered.

95. Automatic Speed Regulator The Five Whys approach acts as a natural speed regulator. The more problems you have, the more you invest in solutions to those problems. As the investments in infrastructure or process pay off, the severity and number of crises are reduced and the team speeds up again.
   - Location: 3094-3097

96. The Five Whys ties the rate of progress to learning, not just execution. Startup teams should go through the Five Whys whenever they encounter any kind of failure, including technical faults, failures to achieve business results, or unexpected changes in customer behavior.

97. Five Whys is a powerful organizational technique. Some of the engineers I have trained to use it believe that you can derive all the other Lean Startup techniques from the Five Whys. Coupled with working in small batches, it provides the foundation a company needs to respond quickly to problems as they appear, without overinvesting or overengineering.

98. When the Five Whys approach goes awry, I call it the Five Blames. Instead of asking why repeatedly in an attempt to understand what went wrong, frustrated teammates start pointing fingers at each other, trying to decide who is at fault. Instead of using the Five Whys to find and fix problems,
   - Location: 3106-3108

99. I recommend several tactics for escaping the Five Blames. The first is to make sure that everyone affected by the problem is in the room during the analysis of the root cause. The meeting should include anyone who discovered or diagnosed the problem, including customer service representatives who fielded the calls, if possible. It should include anyone who tried to fix the symptom as well as anyone who worked on the subsystems or features involved. If the problem was escalated to senior management, the decision makers who were involved in the escalation should be present as well. This may make for a crowded room, but it’s essential. In my experience, whoever is left out of the discussion ends up being the target for blame.

100. When blame inevitably arises, the most senior people in the room should repeat this mantra: if a mistake happens, shame on us for making it so easy to make that mistake.

101. 1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time. 2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.

102. You will need to be prepared for the fact that Five Whys is going to turn up unpleasant facts about your organization, especially at the beginning. It is going to call for investments in prevention that come at the expense of time and money that could be invested in new products or features. Under pressure, teams may feel that they don’t have time to waste on analyzing root causes even though it would give them more time in the long term. The process sometimes will devolve into the Five Blames. At all these junctures, it is essential that someone with sufficient authority be present to insist that the process be followed, that its recommendations be implemented, and to act as a referee if disagreements flare up. Building an adaptive organization, in other words, requires executive leadership to sponsor and support the process.

103. Internal or external, in my experience startup teams require three structural attributes: scarce but secure resources, independent authority to develop their business, and a personal stake in the outcome.
   - Location: 3373-3375
   - Page: 220

104. Startup teams need complete autonomy to develop and market new products within their limited mandate. They have to be able to conceive and execute experiments without having to gain an excessive number of approvals. I strongly recommend that startup teams be completely cross-functional, that is, have full-time representation from every functional department in the company that will be involved in the creation or launch of their early products. They have to be able to build and ship actual functioning products and services, not just prototypes. Handoffs and approvals slow down the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop and inhibit both learning and accountability. Startups require that they be kept to an absolute minimum.
   - Location: 3386-3391
   - Page: 221

105. Third, entrepreneurs need a personal stake in the outcome of their creations. In stand-alone new ventures, this usually is achieved through stock options or other forms of equity ownership. Where a bonus system must be used instead, the best incentives are tied to the long-term performance of the new innovation. However, I do not believe that a personal stake has to be financial. This is especially important in organizations, such as nonprofits and government, in which the innovation is not tied to financial objectives. In these cases, it is still possible for teams to have a personal stake. The parent organization has to make it clear who the innovator is and make sure the innovator receives credit for having brought the new product to life—if it is successful. As one entrepreneur who ran her own division at a major media company told me, “Financial incentives aside, I always felt that because my name was on the door, I had more to lose and more to prove than someone else. That sense of ownership is not insignificant.”

   - Page: 222

106. With an internal startup team, the sequence of accountability is the same: build an ideal model of the desired disruption that is based on customer archetypes, launch a minimum viable product to establish a baseline, and then attempt to tune the engine to get it closer to the ideal. Operating in this framework, internal teams essentially act as startups.
   - Location: 3520-3523
   - Page: 230

107. There are four major kinds of work that companies must manage.3 As an internal startup grows, the entrepreneurs who created the original concept must tackle the challenge of scale. As new mainstream customers are acquired and new markets are conquered, the product becomes part of the public face of the company, with important implications for PR, marketing, sales, and business development. In most cases, the product will attract competitors: copycats, fast followers, and imitators of all stripes. Once the market for the new product is well established, procedures become more routine. To combat the inevitable commoditization of the product in its market, line extensions, incremental upgrades, and new forms of marketing are essential. In this phase, operational excellence takes on a greater role, as an important way to increase margins is to lower costs. This may require a different type of manager: one who excels in optimization, delegation, control, and execution. Company stock prices depend on this kind of predictable growth. There is a fourth phase as well, one dominated by operating costs and legacy products. This is the domain of outsourcing, automation, and cost reduction. Nonetheless, infrastructure is still mission-critical. Failure of facilities or important infrastructure or the abandonment of loyal customers could derail the whole company. However, unlike the growth and optimization phase, investments in this area will not help the company achieve top-line growth. Managers of this kind of organization suffer the fate of baseball umpires: criticized when something goes wrong, unappreciated when things are going well.

108. This year marks the one hundredth anniversary of Frederick Winslow Taylor’s The Principles of Scientific Management, first published in 1911. The movement for scientific management changed the course of the twentieth century by making possible the tremendous prosperity that we take for granted today. Taylor effectively invented what we now consider simply management: improving the efficiency of individual workers, management by exception (focusing only on unexpectedly good or bad results), standardizing work into tasks, the task-plus-bonus system of compensation, and—above all—the idea that work can be studied and improved through conscious effort. Taylor invented modern white-collar work that sees companies as systems that must be managed at more than the level of the individual. There is a reason all past management revolutions have been led by engineers: management is human systems engineering.

## Guerrilla Marketing for Job Hunters 3.0: How to Stand Out From the Crowd and Tap Into the Hidden Job Market Using Social Media and 999 Other Tactics Today
**Author:** Jay Conrad Levinson;David E. Perry

### Highlights (11)

1. We explain why newspapers and job boards (passive mediums) are rapidly being replaced by Boolean search strings (keywords) on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. It was clear no one in the audience realized how proactive employers are when they have a problem to solve, or that hiring managers are 1,000 times more likely to reach out to candidates selectively themselves, before ever using a headhunter, recruiter, employee referral, or advertisement.
   - Location: 638-641
   - Page: 42

2. What's your takeaway? 1. The economy has changed and every organization has had to change the way it does business, and that means changing how it hires. 2. Looking for problems you can solve is easier than looking for a job—one implies value (employers will pay to have a problem resolved), the other simply implies a payroll cost. The audience quickly figured out that an “opportunity” was a chance to solve a problem and that's what engineers do best. This is the most competitive job market we've ever seen, but there are jobs out there, lots of them. They're still aren't enough jobs for everyone though, so it is no longer good enough for you to just be the most qualified. That's not who gets the job. And you probably already know that. The person who gets the job is the one who can find the job to begin with and then maneuver the job search process. Finding and maneuvering to the offer stage are a Guerrilla Job Hunter's competitive advantage.

3. The following qualities will land you at the front of the hiring line: Leadership skills Communication skills Bias toward action Passion Cultural compatibility

   - Page: 69

4. An Employer’s Value Requirements Your Quality That Counts Create new intellectual wealth for my company; add to my intellectual assets. A consuming desire to make something new; to cut a new path rather than take a road. High-energy enthusiasm for the job, regardless of the hours worked. Work is a game—an integral, vibrant part of his or her life. Not only is money not the most important issue—it’s beside the point. Internal pride to leave a “legacy signature” on their work, rather than strive for a paycheck. Enduring performance. An ability to stay and finish the race, because not finishing is inconceivable emotionally. “Think around comers” to solve problems creatively. Have an inner voice saying “There’s always a way [to create a technology fix: make a deal].” Bring up-to-date professionalism into every fray. Contain a desire to grow professionally—to become the best person he or she can be: Invest in themselves. Ever-increasing contribution. The key to inner pleasure is recognized as making an individual contribution. Identify and develop values for your company. Instinctive grasp and exploitation of today’s real value: the intangible capital of brand image, staff talent, and customer relationships. Challenge the status quo. Willingness and courage to speak the truth when you see a conflict. Note: In its simplest form, the New Value Table represents the base elements of your personal “Brand.” Building your brand—making a name for yourself—need not be expensive.

5. Personal branding is about making yourself stand out so that people trust you and are interested in you. Guerrillas do this by leveraging their previous employers’ brand (names, slogans, and logos) to create an identity that is memorable and desirable to the people they want to reach. In marketing speak it’s called the “Halo Effect.”

6. For example, your cover letter; this means naming the projects you worked on or the clients you sold to (if you are an engineer or sales professional). Be specific. Be detailed. Sell the sizzle and the steak. For your resume, it may mean placing the logos (with permission, of course) of the companies you worked for or products you developed on your resume for extra punch. Nothing will get an employer’s attention faster than a well-known brand’s logo, especially if it is a competitor or a coveted account.

Are there any major accounts you know they would like to have or would recognize as difficult to get that would make you look like a superstar? Logos of the companies you have worked for or the major customers you have sold. Perhaps a product you sold if it’s more recognizable than the company’s logo. Engineering Who have you worked for? What major product where you part of designing? Logos of your employers or customers. A logo or photo of the product you designed. Marketing What brands have you helped create?

8. Create a LinkedIn profile and follow the suggested steps to complete your profile 100%, making sure you include your personal brand and pitch in your subtitle and summary sections. Create a Google account and profile for improved search engine optimization. Include your personal brand on your resume, cover letter, business cards, e-mail signature, voice mail message, and across your other social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. Consider creating a personal web site/blog site where you can house all of your information, including experience, education, skills, honors, entrepreneurial efforts, and more. Start your own blog with a unique point of view on your industry/area of interest. Contribute value via book or product reviews, your tweets, your comments on other blog posts, your own blog articles or articles for print publications, your discussions in LinkedIn groups, and your advice via LinkedIn Answers or other forums. Found a company full-time or on the side with relevant and valuable products/services/resources for the industry. Publish and offer print and/or electronic publications. Get quoted in the media by joining HARO (HelpaReporter.com) and contributing advice, experiences, and insights to writers and journalists seeking expert source.

9. Join associations or networking groups within your industry and try attending their events or others to meet new contacts and build your target network. Be sure to share your personal brand with those new contacts. Conduct informational interviews with target network contacts (whether or not you’re seeking a job) and share your personal brand with them in your introductions. Find ways to bring fellow industry thought leaders together on a project or at an event. Find ways to contribute to the projects or events of fellow industry experts. Get recommended on LinkedIn and any other sites or networks where you or your offerings are available and/or collect and display testimonials from customers, clients, and partners.

10. Exercise #1: What do you do well? What do you do better and more easily than other people? Is it the work you’re doing now? Something you studied in school? A hobby? Take out a pad of paper and write down your answers, no matter how unrelated they are to work. The goal is to get your creative juices flowing. Let’s take a fictitious job seeker, Sally, and write down what she does well: public speaking, sales, client service, managing projects, solving computer problems, managing others, speaking French.
   - Location: 1281-1286
   - Page: 84

11. Exercise #2: What do you enjoy doing? What skills do you most enjoy using on the job or in school right now? What would you do even if you weren’t paid? Write your answers down. Here are Sally’s answers to this second question: public speaking, bicycling, client service, solving computer problems, baking cookies, managing others, speaking French, serving as a Girl Scout leader, hiking, writing. Now, you’ll see that Sally’s answers to Exercise 2 produced a different set of skills from Exercise 1. That’s okay. But you will notice several skills that appeared in both lists. That’s better than okay—that is exactly what we’re after! When you write down a skill that you enjoy doing (Exer-cise 2), which you have also written down because you do it well (Exercise 1), underline it. Let’s go back and underline Sally’s skills listed in response to Exercise 2 that were also answers in Exercise 1: public speaking, bicycling, client service, solving computer problems, baking cookies, managing others, speaking French, serving as a Girl Scout leader, hiking, writing. For Sally, the skills she does well and enjoys doing are: public speaking, client service, solving computer problems, and speaking French. Pretty simple, huh? By answering these two questions, Sally now knows more about herself than roughly 90% of job seekers who don’t know what they do well or what they want to do. Now, do this exercise yourself! Write down your answers to questions 1 and 2 above, then underline those skills found in both lists. These are skills you do well and enjoy doing. You may come up with three, four, seven, or more skills. You’re almost done. Now, choose the two or three skills you think will be most attractive to the hiring authority reading your resume. These are your most marketable skills. They will form a base around which you build your profile and arsenal of marketing materials: your Guerrilla Resume and Guerrilla Cover Letter, as well as your LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and other profiles. You will repurpose this information over and over again.

## Mapping the Deep: The Extraordinary Story of Ocean Science by Robert Kunzig (2000-06-29)
**Author:** Robert Kunzig;

### Highlights (5)

1. when you throw things like the space shuttle onto the scale, or the manned space station that is now being built, to uncertain purpose, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars, the conclusion is obvious: the American government thinks space is far, far more important than the ocean.
   - Location: 103-105
   - Page: 7

2. THREE hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, when the primordial fireball had cooled to a mere 5,000 degrees or so, electrons fell into orbit around protons. The change was sudden, as if a spell had been cast. One instant the electrons were running amok, like children in a schoolyard; the next instant, the universe had expanded and cooled and the negatively charged electrons had slowed just enough to succumb to the positive pull of the protons. The particles lined up two-by-two. Astronomers speak of this as the moment when the fog cleared, and light could at last course through the universe unimpeded. But to someone interested in Earth’s ocean and its origin the moment has a different significance. A single electron orbiting a single proton is a hydrogen atom; and although individual particles would part and reunite countless times in the aeons that followed, it was in that early epoch that the universe acquired its basic supply of hydrogen.

3. The oldest fossils known on Earth are 3.5 billion years old. Found in the desert of northwestern Australia by J. William Schopf of the University of California at Los Angeles, they consist of filaments of cells, a dozen or more in a chain, each no more than a few micrometres wide. Schopf has found at least 11 different types of cell, some resembling ordinary bacteria and others cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae. Such diversity indicates that evolution was already well underway 3.5 billion years ago, and that the origin of life lies even farther back in time. It probably does not lie too much farther back, though, because until the heavy bombardment ceased 3.8 billion years ago, the ocean surface was being boiled and sterilized again and again as each new planetesimal plunged into it. That is one reason some researchers have given in recent years for arguing that life did not begin at the surface – in a tide pool, say, or in the “warm little pond” favoured by Charles Darwin – but at a hot spring on the ocean floor.

## Do More Faster...techstars Lessons to Accelerate Your Startup
**Author:** David/ Brad Feld Cohen;Photos

### Highlights (48)

1. Startups are about testing theories and quickly pivoting based on feedback and data. Only through hundreds of small—and sometimes large—adjustments does the seemingly overnight success emerge.
   - Location: 241-243
   - Page: 16

2. Earth-shattering and world-changing ideas are a dime a dozen. In fact, that's being too generous. I've had hundreds of would-be entrepreneurs contact me with great news: They have the next big thing, but they can't risk telling me (or anyone else) about it until I sign some form of idea insurance, usually a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). Like every other sensible investor on the planet, I decline the request to sign the NDA, forgoing the idea, often to the shock, awe, and dismay of the stunned entrepreneur. Why do I avoid this conversation? Because entrepreneurs who behave this way clearly overvalue ideas and therefore, almost by definition, undervalue execution. Brainstorming is a risk-free, carefree activity. Entrepreneurship in the literal sense of “undertaking” is not. Strap on your seat belt if you're signing up for a startup. It's a high-velocity experience.
   - Location: 249-257
   - Page: 17

3. One popular startup dictum worth remembering is “One can steal ideas, but no one can steal execution or passion.” Put in another light: there is no market for ideas. Think about it for a second: have you tried selling an idea lately? Where would you go to sell it? Who would buy it? When there is no market, it is usually a very sure sign that there is no value.1 Almost anyone can (and has!) come up with a great idea, but only a skilled entrepreneur can execute it. Skilled in this case doesn't mean experienced; it means flexible and action-oriented, someone who recognizes that mistakes can often be corrected, but time lost postponing a decision is lost forever. Ideas, however necessary, are not sufficient. They are just an entry ticket to play the game.
   - Location: 264-271
   - Page: 18

4. I've seen “everythingitis” kill many a startup. This is the disease a startup gets when it sets out to add more features than the competition does. This is a fundamentally flawed strategy that presumes that users will adopt a new service just because it has more features. The reality is that most people use a particular service because it does one thing really, really well. Think about your own experiences and you'll understand that this is true.
   - Location: 502-506
   - Page: 33

5. Several TechStars companies came in with a plan like “MySpace + FaceBook + YouTube + kitchen sink.” We coached them early on that they have to be the best in the world at something and then build from there. We asked them to focus on their passion and to pick the smallest meaningful problem that they could solve better than anyone in the world had ever done before.
   - Location: 513-515
   - Page: 34

6. Focus on the smallest possible problem you could solve that would potentially be useful. Most companies start out trying to do too many things, which makes life difficult and turns you into a me-too. Focusing on a small niche has so many advantages: With much less work, you can be the best at what you do. Small things, like a microscopic world, almost always turn out to be bigger than you think when you zoom in. You can much more easily position and market yourself when more focused. And when it comes to partnering, or being acquired, there's less chance for conflict.
   - Location: 517-521
   - Page: 34

7. If you're early in the life of your startup, do yourself a favor and figure out what one thing you're going to be the best in the world at doing. By all means, don't stop there. Just spend some time to think about how you can cross the finish line and avoid throwing in the kitchen sink. The market will love you for it.
   - Location: 527-529
   - Page: 35

8. look for the one thing that you couldn't take away from your customers without them screaming at you. Once they find it, we encourage them to make that one thing even better. Photobucket is a great example of a company that did one thing really well, even though it's not what the founders initially set out to do.
   - Location: 558-560
   - Page: 37

9. Too many startups build things that they think their customers will want. If you're looking for creative ideas that can make your company better, simply spend time with your customers. It's not rocket science, but I'm always surprised by how few companies are really good at doing this.
   - Location: 646-648
   - Page: 43

10. Early on, we struggled with our decision to get our half-baked product into the hands of our users so early in the development process. The biggest reason to delay releasing code has always been “What if the users don't like it and never come back?” The thought of real people having a bad experience is daunting. How would we ever get explosive growth if the product turned people off? In companies that rely on having a large user base as ours does, it is very unlikely that you will offend enough people quickly enough to dampen your future growth. Bad news and bad experiences don't travel quickly; people just don't tell each other about services they don't get value out of. If they do, it's easy to jump in and fix their problems, which can make you a hero. Build the smallest possible product that allows you to test assumptions and answer questions about your business, and then get it out there.
   - Location: 676-683
   - Page: 45

11. In the world of startups, big ideas are one thing but execution is everything. The best entrepreneurs I know execute well by doing several things. Develop passion and vision for the problem they are trying to solve. Identify and understand what they have to do to make it happen. Combine sheer will, determination, and focus to make it happen with a healthy sense of urgency. Have perspective that things rarely go as planned.
   - Location: 704-709
   - Page: 46

12. Ideas are easy to come by. I have had many that I never had time to see through and heard many other good ones from flakes and drifters, but I believe the key to success is focusing on a good idea and implementing it well.
   - Location: 742-743
   - Page: 49

13. We'd heard the statistics like everyone else. We all know that failure is the likely outcome of any individual new venture. However, with each iteration in the marketplace, you give yourself a better chance for success. You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. You only truly fail if you stop trying. So fail fast. Learn quickly. And start again.
   - Location: 847-850
   - Page: 56

14. Too many people take the phrase “fail fast” literally. It doesn't mean that you should make sure that your business fails fast. It means that you should be happy about having a bunch of little failures along the path to success, because if you're not failing, you're probably just not trying enough stuff.
   - Location: 851-853
   - Page: 56

15. A common reason for startup fatalities, particularly in the early days, is some sort of conflict between co-founders. One of the main reasons for co-founder conflict is that many aspects of the relationships were either ill-defined or misunderstood. To minimize the chance of this, it's critical that you and your co-founders come to agreement on some key issues. I've framed the most important of these as a set of questions that the co-founders should be asking each other as they enter into the business relationship. Many of these questions are hard but they get only harder with time. The sooner you address them, the better off your startup will be. How should we split the equity? While there can be different aspects to this, the basic question is really simple: Who gets what percentage of the company? There are different schools of thought on how to arrive at an equitable answer. A perennial favorite is to decide that each founder should own an equal share. Or, you could try to come up with some formula that uses a bunch of different factors such as experience, market value, contribution to date, and expected contributions in the future. However you do it, the important thing is to decide it up front and not put off the discussion. How will decisions get made? This is often tied to the number of shares, but not necessarily. You can have voting and non-voting shares. You can set up a board. You'll need to decide what kinds of decisions the board makes, and which ones it won’t. Common areas to address are decisions around capitalization, executive hiring and firing, share issuance (dilution), and acquisitions. What happens if one of us leaves the company? Although it may seem like a bad idea to be talking about this when you're starting the company—it's not. In the evolution of any startup, there will be good times and bad times and there will likely be times when one or more co-founders are simply not happy and not committed. You should decide how to treat this situation early when it is easier and everyone is at least semi-rational and optimistic about their future involvement in the company. The last thing the company needs is a co-founder who is no longer engaged but is hanging around out of guilt or ambiguity. Or worse, one that claims equity that you don't believe is due. Can any of us be fired? By whom? For what reasons? Yes, that's right—even co-founders can be terminated. Too many people mix the notion of being a shareholder in a startup and having an operating role. These two things should be thought of as separate and distinct. The company should have a mechanism for gracefully terminating the operating role of a co-founder if that's the right thing to do. This is never fun but it should be discussed up front. What are our personal goals for the startup? Although this can change over time, it's helpful to at least get a sense of what each of the co-founders wants to get from the company. If you have one co-founder who wants to build a sustainable business that is spinning off cash and run it forever and another one who wants to shoot for high growth with some type of massive exit through a sale to a much larger company, it's better to get that out in the open early and talk it through. Will this be the primary activity for each of us? Co-founder conflict can stem from misunderstandings around how committed everyone is. Will one of the co-founders be keeping a day job until the company gets off the ground? Will one be working on another sideline business? Under what circumstances will someone decide that they just can't commit to the business full time anymore; for example, if the founders have to go without a salary for six months. What part of our plan are we each unwilling to change? Not all startups need to change their plans during the course of their evolution; just the ones that want to survive and succeed! However, there may be elements of the plan that you don't want to change. This might relate to the product being built or the market being addressed. For example, if one of the founders is fanatically obsessed with wanting to create a consumer software company that lots of people know about, then friction may be created if the model needs to shift to more of an enterprise product. What contractual terms will each of us sign with the company? One of the best examples of this is a noncompete agreement. Will each of the co-founders be signing some sort of contract with the company beyond the shareholder agreement? If so, what are the terms of this agreement? At a minimum, all founders should be willing to assign whatever they develop to the company. Will any of us be investing cash in the company? If so, how is this to be treated? It is very likely that one or more co-founders will be putting in some cash in the early stages of the company. It is critical to decide up front how this cash will be treated. Is it debt? Is it convertible debt? Does it buy a different class of shares? What happens if the company raises follow-on funding? What will we pay ourselves? Who gets to change this in the future? This can be a touchy issue. Risk tolerance varies by individual and it is a good idea to factor this into determining the compensation plan for the founders. The issue can be clouded sometimes when one of the founders is investing significant cash into the enterprise. What are the financing plans for the company? Will the company be self-funded and bootstrapped? Raise angel funding? Raise venture capital funding? What happens if this doesn't occur? While I'm sure there are other issues that could generate co-founder conflict, you'll decrease your chances of misunderstandings and implosion of the team if you visit each of the issues identified here early in the life of your startup.

17. There's an old adage that A-players hire A-players while B-players hire C-players. This refers to the notion that while great performers prefer to be among high-performing people who are similar to or better than they are, mediocre (and poor) performers often want to avoid having their weaknesses exposed and their efforts and abilities challenged. As a result, they often hire people who don't threaten them.

18. Salespeople sell. It's what they do. Have you ever seen the play (or the movie) Glengarry Glen Ross? Salespeople sell. Want the pink Cadillac? Sell. Want the Glengarry leads? Sell. Don't sell? You're fired. It's really that simple. In sales, the process is focused on having the salesperson win. The salesperson cannot think in any other way since his only purpose in life is to sell. For a salesperson, the customer's only reason to exist is to buy. While there is much discussion about the importance of the relationship, the relationship's only importance is to allow the salesperson to continue to sell. It's not evil—it's just how it works. However, this doesn't work for early stage startups. The sale is not what is important. In early stage startups, the relationship reigns supreme. Why? Because startups screw up a lot. If you have solid relationships, there is an allowance for failure.

19. Execution doesn't mean blindly going from point A to point B without collecting an enormous amount of data from many different sources along the way. Great entrepreneurs know how to synthesize these data, make a decision about the path they are going down, and execute.

20. Startups do almost everything at a disadvantage. Initially, most startups have less money than their competitors. Startups have less credibility. They have fewer customers. They have fewer employees, which means there are typically fewer people focused on things like marketing, sales, and product development. Resources are scarce at a startup. But, just like in the martial arts, the best startups use the weight of their opponents against them. Bureaucracy slows down larger companies. People do less because making a mistake can be politically costly. Risk takers who are wrong get fired or lose power internally. The larger the company, the more likely it is to be slow. If there's one competitive advantage that most startups have, it's that they can do more faster. And because they can do more faster they can learn more faster. They can immediately throw things away that don't work because nobody cares anyway. Nobody is trying to protect a brand that doesn't exist, and nobody has any reason to be afraid of small failures. Startups know that's just part of the process.

22. I've been involved with a few startups that couldn't do more faster. They were just as slow to execute as larger competitors. They employed too much process too early, tried to convince themselves that they were absolutely right before taking risks, and thought at the expense of doing. Their great ideas couldn't save them. It turns out that giving up your one obvious competitive advantage often proves to be deadly. If a startup can't do more faster, it usually just gets dead faster.

23. You can't manage what you don't measure. The importance of instrumenting your business properly to enable intelligent decision making cannot be overstated. This is particularly true for companies that run their businesses on the Web. A mountain of otherwise unavailable quantitative data is there for the taking. Every single user interaction can be measured and those data can be tremendously valuable when properly interpreted. On the other hand, starting a company and creating a product that didn't previously exist in a market segment that may not have previously existed is a murky proposition at best. And there are often precious little data to go on in the earliest days of a company's life. And when available, the data are often confusing. Furthermore, a company's friends, mentors, advisors, and board members often give conflicting advice. Market research and user focus groups can yield inconsistent data and lead to conclusions that are in opposition to one another. What is an early stage founder to do? Let me offer two bits of conflicting advice (get used to that!). First, be suspicious of your data. Consider everything that you hear, measure, and learn to be anecdotal even if it is corroborated by several sources. Second, especially early on, remember to gather as much data as possible and measure every aspect of your business. If you don't instill this discipline at the beginning, you'll never catch up, and you'll never have the right information to make the right decisions. Be prepared for the data to give you a head fake. Early success with a certain customer segment might lead to a decision to focus on a subgroup of customers that turns out to be really hard to sell to and which happens to represent only 4 percent of the overall customer base. Don't be like the guy looking for his lost car keys late at night in the parking lot who is looking only underneath the lamppost because that is the only place he can see. Constantly revisit the data—measuring the wrong things can be worse than measuring nothing. For example, if you are running an ad-supported media site, a maniacal focus on increasing page views per user session might frustrate loyal users and could drastically reduce ad click-through rates and ultimately harm the business. Remember to think exponentially, especially in the world of technology. A few early data points on a geometric curve might lead you to conclude that you're observing a linear phenomenon, which would lead to some seriously erroneous predictions about what points farther up the curve might look like. To paraphrase Ray Kurzweil, when presented with exponential growth, remember that people tend to drastically overestimate what will happen in the short term, but will profoundly underestimate what happens over longer time spans. It has been said that one measure of intelligence is the ability to hold contradictory thoughts in one's mind simultaneously. Well, consider life as a founder of a startup to be one big intelligence test. In the end, you'll need to get comfortable living with messy and incomplete data. Remember that living the startup life requires both art and science and is simultaneously qualitative and quantitative. Take all the inputs you can gather and then make the decisions that feel right to both your head and your gut. Ryan

24. While the phrase “progress equals validated learning” might seem chewy and theoretical, it's actually a brilliant combination of words. Fundamentally, all startups want to make progress. But as Eric points out, the measures of progress are often wrong and misleading, especially at the early stages. Using the filter of “validated learning” (namely—something that you've learned that you know is true) is a powerful frame of reference that forces more discipline into the discussion.

26. It's often said that the information hierarchy starts with data, builds to information, and eventually peaks with knowledge. Yet, in the entrepreneurial world, I've found that anecdotes come even before data, and it's important to have a broad number of them before you start abstracting up to the data layer.

27. We recommend something similar to the Getting Things Done (GTD) system by David Allen, which includes tactics such as “inbox zero.” Your goal should be to touch every e-mail only once and either respond to it immediately or put it on a to-do list with a due date to be dealt with later. Then, delete the item from your inbox. Do not use your inbox as your to-do list—this is a guaranteed path to e-mail misery.

28. Use e-mail as a branding opportunity. Many entrepreneurs send e-mail from a generic gmail, yahoo, or hotmail address. This is silly—every time you send an e-mail like this you're missing a branding opportunity for your company. Send and receive e-mail from your company domain so that every time someone gets an e-mail from you they will think about your company.

29. Taking weeks to respond to e-mail or not responding at all are also terrific ways to suck at e-mail. As a general rule, you should try to delete or respond to e-mail within a day or two. If you are on vacation or out of pocket, set up an auto-responder so that people know what's going on. If you don't know how to answer an e-mail, reply quickly and say that you're going to think about it (and set up a to-do item). Perhaps the biggest way that people suck at e-mail is simply by not being concise and direct. Enough said.

30. Mark O’Sullivan of Vanilla came up with seven rules to not suck at e-mail. They are so good that we are repeating his blog post about them here. 1. Use the subject line—Sounds simple, but it amazes me how many people send out e-mails with useless subjects like “hey,” or worse—no subject at all. The subject line is not only the first glimpse a person gets of your reason for contacting them (which is extremely important if you are e-mailing someone cold), but it also is a key piece of information that people might search on when trying to find your e-mail some time down the road. Take a moment to actually think about the purpose of your e-mail. Keep it between two and seven words. Make it descriptive and succinct. 2. The “three sentence rule”—This is one that can be tricky to use across all e-mails you send, but it is definitely worth using when you are reaching out to people whom you don't know personally, you have never contacted before, or you know suck at replying to e-mails. Keep your e-mail body down to three sentences. I know that you might feel the need to put more information into an e-mail than three sentences, but the reality is that the people on the other end of the line are giant question marks. You don't know how busy they are, how much they suck at e-mail, how interested they are in what you have to say, and so on. If you write more than three sentences, there is a high likelihood that they will not reply to your e-mail. It can be challenging at first, but you'll eventually find that you can get your point across in an extremely succinct manner. Ask only one question, and put it in your last sentence. This leaves the question lingering in the other person's mind, and it allows them to quickly shoot you back a response without feeling the pressure of a mass volume, heavy content e-mail that will require more than one minute of their time. Most importantly, it gets the volley of conversation started, so your more detailed questions or information can follow up in a conversation that the other person is now invested in. 3. Spell check—If you are not great at spelling, use the spell checker. Nothing makes you look worse than bad spelling and bad grammar. Simple, but true. 4. Reply to important e-mails right away—I used to get important e-mails and decide that I needed to think about the response for a long time before replying. I didn't want to send knee-jerk e-mails back that had incomplete information. So, I'd wait a day, maybe two days, or sometimes as long as a week. Two things happen when you do this: First, the person on the other end thinks that you didn't get the e-mail, you don't care about the e-mail, or you are a complete idiot. Second, you could possibly forget to ever reply at all. So, when I get important e-mails, I reply to them right away—even if I don't have all of the information the person needs. I'll tell the person that I don't have it, but I'll get it to them by a certain date, and then I set a reminder and make sure that I get them that information by the time I said I would. 5. Use “unread” status—This is a habit I've picked up, and I find it extremely useful. If I read an e-mail that isn't very important, but does require a response from me, I'll leave it marked as unread until I have the time or information required to respond. Every time I open my e-mail program, I see X unread messages, and I am reminded of the e-mails I need to respond to. At least once a day I know I have the time to respond to those e-mails (typically first thing in the morning), so I'll go back and make sure that everyone gets the information they need. 6. Be conscious of how much you suck—If you send out e-mails that you consider important and you don't get a response, think about why that might be. Go back to the preceding points and compare the rules to the e-mail you sent: Did you use a descriptive subject? Was the body of your e-mail full of too much information, or did you stick to the three-sentence rule? Did you ask only one question, or did you manage to squeeze more than one question into your three sentences? Did you have spelling mistakes? Was your grammar so bad that the e-mail didn't even make sense? If you've done a good job on all of those points, then we fall into point 4: the person you are trying to contact (a) didn't get the e-mail, (b) doesn't care about the e-mail, or (c) is a complete idiot. Because so many people suck at e-mail, I've often found myself falling into the (b) category. No matter which way the cookie crumbles, you need to remember the most important rule of all when sending e-mails. . . . 7. Be persistent—No matter what the reason is for someone not replying to you, persistence will get you everywhere. The best way to be persistent and not be annoying is to use Rules 1, 2, and 3. Keep your e-mails about the business at hand, and don't let emotion get involved—which can be difficult if you're dealing with someone who sucks at e-mail. The last bit of advice I can give on this point is to remember that we all live in the real world. E-mail is fast and easy, but the reality is that not everyone uses it, and not everyone cares about it. I know it's scary, but if you're dealing with someone who sucks at e-mail, sometimes you just have to pick up the phone and call.

33. So what is the secret behind building useful, meaningful features? First, focus on ease of use. Your site and your new features have to be very easy to use and graphically appealing. If you try to rush out a ton of features, it will not look good and will result in an unpolished, and hard to use product. One of the things we are most proud of about DailyBurn is that we've made the product look good while being very easy to use. We realize that a site to track your workouts and food intake isn't an earth-shattering idea and that there are a lot of sites out there trying to do the same thing we do. The reason we have been able to grow is because we make it as easy as possible for users to track their fitness on our site. Next, build one thing well. If you try to build every feature that comes to mind, the result will be an unfocused product with no chance of success. When we started DailyBurn we focused on one thing and one thing only—a social workout tracking tool that lets you track actual results. We did that one thing well, got an audience, and then listened to our users. User after user screamed for food and nutrition tracking, so we took our time and built high quality nutrition tracking. Now our food-tracking tool is even more popular than our workout tracking tools because we focused on quality. Finally, listen to some, but not all, of your users. User feedback is good, but don't listen to all of it. We had so many early requests for features (and we still get hundreds a day) that we would have drowned if we tried to implement a fraction of them. You have to be willing to say no to your users. Want to know a secret? The next new big feature you are working on will only convert a marginal number of new users to paying users and not be your big ticket to acquisition next week. In fact, that big feature you are working on right now might be a complete bust and you could lose users. Measure the impact of every new feature so you'll know for sure what kind of effect each of them has. Focus on quality—not just quantity. And make something that makes you proud (not just your mom).

34. Learning experts agree that learning by doing is the best way to learn something. When you do something—when you pick up the phone and talk to a potential customer, launch a prototype, send out the first brochure—you learn infinitely more than if you think about doing it in the abstract. The best way to test the validity of a business idea, for example, is to start the business and quickly gauge market feedback.

35. From an outsider's perspective, startups are often synonymous with their products. After all, that's the only connection most people will ever have to your company. It therefore follows that if your product sucks, your company sucks. And I'm sure you'll agree that the majority of products, at least on the Internet, suck. You do the math. We often talk about the Number One startup killer at TechStars—making a product for which there is no interesting market. TechStars accepts just 10 of more than 600 startups that apply and presumably they are among the best. But still, we find that at least one-third of those startups are attempting to build a product that they want, or that no one wants, instead of what the market wants. Every year, this is one of the key things that happens at TechStars—products get dropped, and new ones are born. You can't hide from a lack of market at TechStars. It stalks you and threatens to kill you.

36. Startups are like music bands—without fans (or users or customers), you don't have much. At first, we thought building a business was a linear process: build the product, charge for it, and people will pay you. If you're launching a business in a known industry with a known product, like a coffee shop, you can follow that model. But tech entrepreneurs don't live in that world: we live to innovate and to build a new product that transforms an existing industry or creates a whole new industry. If you are innovating, you actually don't know what your product needs to be. Furthermore, your customers don't either. No one does. But what you do know is that there is a problem that the right product will solve. It's through rapid iteration—trial and error—that you can figure this out. You're basically running experiments, and for these particular experiments you need test subjects. You need users, especially the kind who want to experiment alongside you because they believe in your vision.

37. It's important to start by building a culture of feedback and measured analytics into your process and your organization. The reason for this is that startup success often boils down to your ability to do two things: make money and make users happy. If you can figure out how to do both of those things at scale, then you probably have an interesting business on your hands. Luckily, you can tell if users are happy or not by measuring their behavior. There are five key metrics to measuring user behavior and happiness: 1. Acquisition—How are users coming to your site through various channels? 2. Activation—Are users happy with their first experience? 3. Retention—Are users coming back? 4. Referral—Are users telling others? 5. Revenue—Are users spending money or allowing you to monetize in some way?

40. There is one thing that the hundred of founders I meet each year have in common, and that is that their plan is wrong. Sometimes it's the big things, sometimes it's the little things, but the plan is always wrong. Founders who can pivot to a new idea given what they learn will survive their plan being wrong while those who believe that all signs pointing to trouble are wrong are not going to survive.

41. so many companies raise money that then burns a hole in their pocket; they start hiring people, growing infrastructure, and in general spending way too much.

42. First, ask the prospective investor how long he has been making angel investments, how many he has made, and how much he typically invests each time. If you get dodgy answers, or fundamentally tiny ones such as “I've done one angel investment in the last seventeen years,” beware. Don't proceed with any other questions until you have this answer. If an angel investor says he is just getting into making angel investments, this should set off your Spidey sense. In this case, do your homework and start checking highly trusted references that you source yourself. Check with known reputable angel investors and local venture capitalists on both the person and the companies he has been involved in to get a sense of how real the prospective investor is. Research his background—is he really likely to have the type of money necessary to make angel investments? If your prospective investor says he's been investing for a year or more, ask him to introduce you to two companies he has invested in during the last year. If he can't name two in the past year, then ask him for the last three he has invested in. If there aren't three, recognize that this person is at best investing as a hobbyist and has very limited experience doing so. Now call or e-mail all three companies and ask to speak to the founders. Verify that the person actually invested dollars in that company. Check the reference while you're at it and ask if they were helpful to the company or not. None of these questions or tactics will be offensive to real angel investors. In fact, they will give the real ones more confidence in you. These tactics might offend the fake ones, driving them away. Recognize that that's just fine. Beware of angel investors who aren’t. They'll put you through endless diligence, play bait-and-switch with your financing, and generally waste your time.

43. Seed investors—people like me who are typically putting the first chunk of cash into a new startup—have the shortest checklist. Because we invest so early in the life of a company, a lot of the data points that later-stage investors are using to evaluate an opportunity are not yet available to us. So I focus on three things: “People, Products, and Markets.” Or actually: First of all, the market the entrepreneurs are going after needs to be “big enough.” You will often hear VCs state that an opportunity is “too small for them,” that they don't see “VC-type returns,” or can't see a “$1 billion company.” When you are investing very early, you want to make sure that the target market feels big enough; that is, that the company you are looking at investing in can reasonably grow revenues to $10 million or more in three years and $50-to-$100 million in five to seven years without needing 100 percent adoption. Next, I look for products that win users over. You either have users (alpha, beta, gamma, whatever you call them doesn't matter) or you don’t. If you don’t, I'll look at mockups and demos to figure out if what you are building will get the traction that you are claiming it will. But it is tough to figure this out since having users is real external validation that your product is perceived as interesting, valuable, and differentiated and one day, maybe, someone would actually pay for it. As a former product guy, I will also spend a lot of time using the product myself, trying to assess some of the characteristics I just mentioned. But, most importantly, it's all about the Peeps. Until recently, my trifecta “People, Products, Markets” used to be “People, People, People” but I adjusted it because the product and market clearly have impact on my early stage investment decisions. I'm looking for a variety of characteristics in early stage entrepreneurs, such as: Passion Determination, dedication, and tenacity Raw intelligence Agility and resourcefulness Clarity and focus Empathy Natural leadership Working smart rather than working hard (okay, working hard, too) Team dynamics All these characteristics are important. While some are more important than others, founding teams display different mixes of these. Think of them as being weights of different shapes and sizes that you place on a scale: at some point the scale will tip—and you will get a funding offer (or not). In recent years, where capital efficiency has been a prevalent factor in building an entire generation of consumer Internet companies, the traits I favor the most are determination, agility, clarity, and working smart. I've recently started using the following tag line for my firm SoftTech VC: Seeking the perfect combo: “a smart-ass team with a kick-ass product in a big-ass market.” I think that it perfectly embodies what I am doing for a living, and it's easily shortened to “The Three Asses Rule” once you know the long version.

45. In general, there are only two things that investors really care about when making investments: returns and control. Returns refers to the end-of-the-day financial return the investor will get and the terms that have direct impact on these economics. Control refers to mechanisms that allow the investors to either affirmatively exercise control over the business or to veto certain decisions the company can make. If you are negotiating a deal and an investor is digging his heels in on a provision that doesn't affect the returns or control, they are probably blowing smoke, rather than elucidating substance. Or perhaps they aren't that sophisticated or, worse, are just jerks.

47. Second, lock down your intellectual property (IP). Make sure you do not inadvertently leave critical IP outside the company. If you are involved in a technology startup and the crown jewels of your company relate to its IP, you want to protect it! It sounds easy, but following this advice is not always intuitive. For example, roughly over half of the companies that come to the Colorado Law School's Entrepreneurial Law Clinic previously worked with independent contractors on a handshake basis. These companies are surprised to learn that the contractor, not the company, may well own IP developed by the contractor. A simple solution when working with independent contractors is to have a written contract that unambiguously assigns IP over to the company. By having a legal entity formed, it is easier to have agreements

48. Third, decide who owns what. When you organize a company, sort out the ownership among the founders. Ownership disputes are a startup killer. Ownership matters can be delicate discussions, of course; however, it is always easier to address ownership before the business succeeds, instead of after there is real money to fight over. Moreover, if founders cannot navigate ownership discussions early on, this is likely a red flag of communication failures to come.

## They Got It Wrong: Science: All the Facts That Turned Out to Be Science Fiction
**Author:** Graeme Donald

### Highlights (3)

1. In 1865, a small group of physicians led by Vienna’s leading dermatologist, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra (1816–80), lured Semmelweis to an asylum under the pretense that his opinion was sought on certain matters. As soon as Semmelweis was through the door he became suspicious and tried to leave, but von Hebra’s henchmen were prepared and beat Semmelweis so badly that he died shortly after in one of the asylum’s dungeons.

2. IT FELT LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME In the 1950s the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to combat Borneo’s malaria problem by killing mosquitoes with DDT spray. Although a success, the spraying also killed off the wasps that fed on the roof-munching thatch-caterpillar, which promptly de-roofed the homes in the local area. Lots of cats also died after trying to lick themselves clean, which meant the rat-population exploded. The RAF then parachuted in more than 10,000 hungry felines to deal with the problem!

3. Mark Twain once remarked, “Heaven for the climate, but Hell for the company” but, according to the Bible, Heaven is the hotter of the two. Isaiah 30:26 describes that in Heaven “the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days,” which, according to a series of weighty calculations involving the Stefan–Boltzmann fourth power law of radiation, gives us a temperature of 977º Fahrenheit (525º Celsius). Hell, the Bible tells us, abounds with pits of liquid brimstone (sulfur), so the temperature there must be 833º Fahrenheit (445 degrees Celsius), because any temperature higher than that turns sulfur into gas.

## How Music Dies (Or Lives): Field Recording and the Battle for Democracy in the Arts
**Author:** Ian Brennan;Corin Tucker

### Highlights (7)

1. A faceless Silicon Valley “leader” (deliberately left unnamed here so as not to add to his undeserved and exaggerated infamy) recently proclaimed that the most important issue of our time is that every child become connected to the Internet. What seemed to be lost on his privileged, provincial little mind was that being hooked up with clean water, health care, education, and electricity might first prove to be more pressing matters. Things humans truly “cannot live without.”

3. A pitfall of capturing music in any permanent, reproducible medium is that it can arrest the artistic growth and progress of that musical form. The archetypal field recordings that Alan Lomax did throughout America’s South in the 1940s (or the forefather of all sonic “exotica” documentation, Jesse Fewkes in 1889), more than exemplifying exact musical genres like the blues, were in fact reflections of individual aesthetics at one exact moment in time. The assumption that bluegrass music always sounded like it did in the era in which it was first so faithfully documented is to disregard the fluidity of all musical creation. Not only would bluegrass have sounded different one hundred years earlier, it probably sounded markedly different even five years before (and would have more so five years later, had it not been for the permanence of the recordings themselves which led to more precise mimicry, turning music-making from a process, instead, into a “thing” that could literally be held and examined).

4. Art is designed to reveal, not to show us what we already see and know. Yet, the gigantic copying machine that is the music industry, by necessity, thrives on repetition. And when a system ceases changing, it has become a cadaver.

5. silence does not exist. Sound is always found. Silence is merely noise that has stabilized or been masked or ignored. That is why filmmakers almost never utilize actual silence for effect, but instead when indicating it, emphasize the meeker details that normally wouldn’t be evident at all (e.g., a fly’s buzzing) if things were louder. And “noise” is nothing more than whatever is classified as homeless and unwelcome sound.

7. Behavioral issues are almost never a problem of information. They are nearly always primarily of emotion. That’s why you can’t talk an alcoholic or abuser out of their behavior.

## The Future of Mental Health: Deconstructing the Mental Disorder Paradigm
**Author:** Eric Maisel

### Highlights (12)

1. human beings have human experiences. On the face of it this sounds ludicrous. Who doesn’t know this? You know exactly what it feels like to be rejected, to hate your job, to need to divorce your mate, to feel suddenly overwhelmed by some trifle. You know what it’s like to have tax season arrive again, to worry about that spot on your skin, to not like what your son just said to you, to not much like your own personality. Why would I need to remind you that human beings have human experiences?

2. Thomas Szasz, a well-known opponent of contemporary psychiatric practices, proposed that what we are seeing with disturbed people are not symptoms of illness but human beings angling for what they want via playacting. Szasz observed that as soon as a particular game became socially unacceptable—say, for women to act “hysterically”—that “mental illness” simply vanished. When fainting fell out of fashion, women simply stopped fainting. Szasz’s ideas are provocative and interesting, but who can really say? And how could we ever really know?

3. The matter of what is normal can’t be and must not be a mere statistical nicety. It can’t be and must not be “normal” to be a Christian just because 95 percent of your community is Christian. It can’t be and must not be “normal” to be attracted to someone of the opposite sex just because 90 percent of the general population is heterosexual. It can’t be and must not be “normal” to own slaves just because all the landowners in your state own slaves. “Normal” can’t mean and must not mean “what we see all the time” or “what we see the most of.” It must have a different meaning for it to mean anything of value to right-thinking people. Nor can it mean “free of discomfort,” as if “normal” were the equivalent of oblivious and you are somehow “abnormal” when you are sentient, human, and real. This, however, is the game currently being played by the mental health industry: it makes this precise, illegitimate switch.

4. Say, for example, that I’m a well-known mental health professional. I tell you, another mental health professional, that the “patient” I’m sending over to you, a person who is completely mentally healthy, “appears neurotic but is really psychotic.” What are the chances that you will agree with my diagnosis in the absence of any actual evidence of “neurosis” or “psychosis”? According to one elegant experiment, 100 percent! There looks to be a 100 percent chance that, even if I am well, you will see me as sick because a colleague of yours told you that I’m sick. In an experiment performed by Maurice Temerlin and reported in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, Temerlin had an actor memorize a script designed to portray a mentally healthy individual whom we’ll call Harry. Harry was happy, effective at work, self-confident, warm, gracious, happily married, and insightful—as mentally healthy as a person can be. Harry’s performance, presented as an “intake interview,” was played for a group of mental health professionals. Beforehand, a well-known mental health professional told the gathered group that they were about to listen to an interview with a man who “appears neurotic but is really psychotic.” After listening to Harry, they were told to rate Harry’s mental health based only on the interview; they were explicitly told not to use the information provided by the “prestige associate.” The results? Virtually every graduate student, clinical psychologist, and psychiatrist rated Harry as either neurotic or psychotic. The psychiatrists were the worst in this regard: 60 percent rated him psychotic and 40 percent rated him neurotic. Having listened to an interview with a healthy man and having been told to confine their ratings to the evidence of that interview, 100 percent of the psychiatrists judged him disordered because a “prestige associate” told them that they ought to.

5. In light of these various realities, there is probably really only one thing to call you: a person. An individual who crosses a service provider’s threshold is neither a patient nor a client but a person. There. We have named him. Every single other appellation confuses and obscures matters. Since only “person” captures the flavor of human obstinacy, of human resiliency—of everything human—“person” is what we must call the customer of a mental health service provider. Our human experience specialists will say, for example, “I am currently working with several people.” How simple, straightforward, and truthful!

7. For more than fifty years, the Hungarian psychiatrist Thomas Szasz argued tirelessly that “mental illness” was a harmful myth and a self-serving metaphor employed by the psychiatric industry to drum up business. He wrote in The Myth of Mental Illness, “My aim is to suggest that the phenomena now called mental illnesses be looked at afresh and more simply, that they be removed from the category of illnesses, and that they be regarded as the expressions of man’s struggle with the problem of how he should live. Since medical interventions are designed to remedy only medical problems, it is logically absurd to expect that they will help solve problems whose very existence has been defined and established on nonmedical grounds.”

8. A chemical becomes medicine in context. It changes its name by virtue of how it is being used. The chemicals called antibiotics are being used to treat your infection. They are still “mere” chemicals but they have been legitimately elevated to the high status of medication by virtue of why and how they are being used. We call them medicine because they are being used to treat an actual disease. If the disease were not there—if we were not using these chemicals to fight something worse than the chemicals themselves—we would not subject anyone to those powerful chemicals.

9. Marijuana is a substance. It is a mere chemical-with-effects when we use it to alter our experience of reality, and it is medicine if we use it as treatment for our glaucoma. Glaucoma is a certain identifiable medical condition and not a metaphor. “Life sucks” is a certain existential or psychological issue, real in its pain but not a medical condition. Smoking marijuana to “leave life for a bit” is not a “treatment” of anything medical but rather a characteristic use of a certain chemical substance to alter our experience of reality. If we could reserve “drug,” “medication,” or “medicine” as words that we only use when we are talking about treating actual biological disorders, it would amount to a giant step forward. It would be lovely if we could also get the following distinctions made. There ought to be a way to language the difference between treating a disorder, treating a symptom of a disorder, using a chemical for some purpose while trying to treat a disorder, and treating something we mistakenly call “a symptom of a disorder” when no disorder exists. These are four distinct situations that are currently crushed together as one.

10. First of all, what do we mean by “cause and effect”? Cause and effect are far from simple concepts. What’s the difference between a cause, a factor, an influence, and so on? When is a single cause necessary and sufficient to create a certain effect? In classical philosophy the subject is usually taught by beginning with Descartes’ example of one billiard ball striking a second billiard ball. The first billiard ball “causes” the second billiard ball to move. This might be thought of as the strict or simple sense of “cause and effect.” In this example one thing is clearly linked to another thing in a logical, proximate, and seemingly singular and sufficient way. However this sort of explanation never tells the whole story, since it is always possible to raise the question, “But isn’t whatever caused the first ball to move the real reason that the second ball moved?” Indeed, you could wend your way back to the big bang and beyond in what is called infinite regression. Second, is this cause really sufficient for this effect to happen? What if the second ball were glued to the table? The first ball caused the second ball to move only because the second ball was free to move. Still, despite these many technical difficulties, this is what we most often mean by cause and effect: that one thing logically, proximately, singularly, and sufficiently caused another thing to happen.

11. A reasonable example of “strict causation” might be little Bobby falling out of a tree and breaking his arm. The fall caused the break. This appears straightforward enough. But the simplicity of this picture vanishes the instant we decide to focus our attention one place or another. We can identify multiple causes of anything just by virtue of the direction of our gaze, the nature of our questions, and the categories that we decide to create and include, and this is abundantly true with little Bobby and his fall. If I ask you, “What caused Bobby’s broken arm?” you might reply in any of the following ways, all of which imply one or another spin on cause and effect: “He’s a reckless rascal,” “Being a boy,” “Fury at our divorce,” “The ground,” “Bad luck,” or “Gravity.” In addition, if you are playing the current illegitimate mental disorder naming game that I’ve described previously, you might also include “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” or “childhood depression.” Each of these is a different explanation as to what really caused Bobby’s broken arm. How you choose to look at the matter may have great consequences for little Bobby. If you go with “bad luck,” Bobby may have full permission to keep climbing trees. If, however, you go with “reckless rascal,” you might punish Bobby and curb his tree-climbing exploits. If you go with one of the mental disorder labels, you might agree to have Bobby put on one or more powerful chemicals. These differences matter to Bobby. In the first case we have a Bobby who is free to keep climbing trees, in the second case we have a restricted Bobby who may pine for climbing and grow distressed at his lack of freedom, and in the third case we’ve created little patient Bobby with a mental disorder label and a regimen of powerful chemicals with powerful side effects.

12. Rather than presume that your child has a medical condition or a pseudo-medical condition called a “mental disorder” when sad, anxious, or angry, presume something else instead. Presume that you do not know what is going on and that you need to ask some important questions of yourself, your child, the people in your circle, and, if they enter the picture, mental health service providers. Decide that you will think before you agree to allow your child to be labeled and “medicated.”

It is a perfect absorber of radiation and, therefore, as Kirchhoff showed, a perfect emitter of radiation. ‘Perfect’ here means that the radiation emitted by a black body does not depend on what the black body is made of, its size, shape or any other physical properties. All that matters is its temperature. As it gets hot, some of the radiation inside leaks out through the hole and can be studied using prisms, spectroscopes and so on. You can even heat it more forcefully using, say, a Bunsen burner. It doesn’t matter how the box gets hot; the radiation is always the same. This is black-body radiation or, to give it a semi-obsolete but descriptive name, ‘cavity radiation’. A key point to take away from this is that a ‘black body’ is not necessarily black. It may be a strong emitter of light and heat. Indeed, on this basis the Sun is an almost perfect black body – and so are the stars.

1. With each science-based recommendation for policies or procedures, we essentially become a more paternalistic society. And most of us are (understandably) uncomfortable with paternalism and its implication of a condescending, one-way relationship in which our lives can be dictated by others.

2. John Stuart Mill’s influential definition of freedom, which seems to hold up even today, can inform our decisions about when paternalism may be more or less necessary. As Mill said, “The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental or spiritual.”

6. if you introduce normal bacteria into adult sterile mice, their behavior doesn’t change. If, however, you take mice that are still growing and colonize them with the same bacteria, they will develop more typical fear responses. This suggests that our biota can influence brain development. It makes a certain amount of sense, Knight says, considering that our guts produce many of our neurotransmitters, including 90 percent of our serotonin, a linkage that, in a term of complete scientific awesomeness, is called the “gut-brain axis.” In other words, it’s looking increasingly likely that it’s not so much that you are mostly not you as that you are also the slime sloshing around your innards. If the medical advances of the twentieth century taught us to stop thinking of our minds and bodies as separate entities, the twenty-first may teach us to include our symbiotic biota: Our Bacteria, Ourselves.

8. it is heuristics—the subtle mental strategies that often give rise to such biases—that do much of the heavy lifting in risk perception. The “availability” heuristic says that the easier a scenario is to conjure, the more common it must be. It is easy to imagine a tornado ripping through a house; that is a scene we see every spring on the news and all the time on reality TV and in movies. Now try imagining someone dying of heart disease. You probably cannot conjure many breaking-news images for that one, and the drawn-out process of atherosclerosis will most likely never be the subject of a summer thriller. The effect? Twisters feel like an immediate threat, although we have only a 1-in-46,000 chance of being killed by a cataclysmic storm. Even a terrible tornado season like the one last spring typically yields fewer than 500 tornado fatalities.

A 2007 study conducted by the Cultural Cognition Project at Yale Law School and coauthored by Paul Slovic surveyed 1,850 people about the risks and benefits of nanotech. Even though 81 percent of participants knew nothing or very little about nanotechnology before starting the survey, 89 percent of all respondents said they had an opinion on whether nanotech’s benefits outweighed its risks. In other words, people made a risk judgment based on factors that had little to do with any knowledge about the technology itself. And as with public reaction to nuclear power, more information did little to unite opinions. “Because people with different values are predisposed to draw different factual conclusions from the same information, it cannot be assumed that simply supplying accurate information will allow members of the public to reach a consensus on nanotechnology risks, much less a consensus that promotes their common welfare,” the study concluded.

## Drunk Tank Pink: And Other Unexpected Forces That Shape How We Think, Feel, and Behave
**Author:** Adam Alter

### Highlights (15)

1. This book is an attempt to uncover the role of Drunk Tank Pink and dozens of other hidden forces as they shape how we think, feel, and behave. Some, like Drunk Tank Pink, emerge from nowhere to become pop culture legends. Others, like sunshine and beautiful women, have long occupied a prominent place in folk wisdom, though folk wisdom often falls short when it tries to capture the complexities of human behavior. And other forces still, like the names we give children and new business ventures, hide in plain sight, guiding our thoughts as we go about the business of everyday life unaware of their influence. Understanding these forces is more than a matter of idle curiosity, as some can be harnessed for the good while others are mitigated to prevent the bad. Some of them push us toward smarter decisions and happier outcomes, and others undermine our persistent quest for health and well-being. These forces (or cues, as psychologists call them) take many forms, arising from three different worlds: the mental world made up of small cues that burrow their way into our heads; the social world that connects us; and the wider physical world that surrounds us. Each of us is an ongoing product of the world within us, the world between us, and the world around us—and their hidden capacity to shape our every thought, feeling, and behavior.

2. There’s a potent moral to the story I’ve told so far: you’re unlikely to be celebrated for having a creative name, but that same creative (and therefore disfluent) name may prime you for negative attention and negative outcomes. It’s easy to sympathize with exuberant parents who celebrate the miracle of new life by naming that miracle Keirraih, but when young Keirraih starts school and then work, she’s likely to be a magnet for negative attention. Just as wise parents name their biological offspring with care, wise entrepreneurs choose names for their commercial offspring carefully. Even company names that seem innocuous at first have the potential to give their parents heartburn. In one striking case, the inoffensively named Experts Exchange, an online technology problem-solving company, exposed itself to mockery when it chose the web address www.expertsexchange.com. (The address is now www.experts-exchange .com, and the company has resolved the ambiguity in its favor by choosing the strategically capitalized Twitter handle ExpertsExchange.)

3. Labels Make a Complex World Simpler In 1672, Sir Isaac Newton passed a beam of white light through a clear prism and projected the resulting rainbow against the wall of his laboratory. He perceived five distinct colors within the rainbow, which he labeled red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. These labels pleased him for a while, but he believed that colors and musical notes shared a single structure, and that both fell along seven-step octaves. So he returned to his rainbow and decided that a thin sliver of orange fell between thicker bands of red and yellow, and a subtle strip of indigo fell between the blue and violet bands. The resulting seven-colored rainbow is the one we know today. Newton’s detractors were unimpressed, and they debated the true composition of the rainbow for many years, sometimes claiming that Newton’s prisms were cloudy, dirty, or impure, and sometimes arguing that he had seen in the prism too many colors, too few colors, or the wrong colors altogether. But Newton was no more or less right than his critics, because the colors that form the visible rainbow are part of a continuous spectrum. We see distinct colors in the spectrum, but their boundaries are impossible to measure precisely. Regardless, why should it matter whether we use Newton’s five-color taxonomy, his seven-color taxonomy, or some other variation? The colors don’t change merely because we give them different labels, so why should we see them differently? As it turns out, Newton’s choice was far from trivial, because colors and their labels are inextricably linked. Without labels, we’re unable to categorize colors—to distinguish between ivory, beige, wheat, and eggshell, and to recognize that broccoli heads and stalks are both green despite differing in tone. To show the importance of color labels, in the mid-2000s, a team of psychologists capitalized on a difference between color terms in the English and Russian languages. In English, we use the word blue to describe both dark and light blues, encompassing shades from pale sky blue to deep navy blue. In contrast, Russians use two different words: goluboy (lighter blue) and siniy (darker blue). The researchers asked English-speaking and Russian-speaking students to decide which of two blue squares matched a third blue target square on a computer screen. The students performed the same task many times. Sometimes both the squares were light blue, sometimes both were dark blue, and sometimes one of them was light blue and the other was dark blue. When both fell on the same side of the blue spectrum—either light or dark blue—the English and Russian students were equally quick to determine which of the squares matched the color of the third target square. But the results were quite different when one of the colors was lighter blue (or goluboy according to the Russian students) and the other was darker blue (siniy). On those trials, the Russian students were much quicker to decide which square matched the color of the target square.

4. We also know that the Russian students relied on these category names, because their advantage over the English students disappeared altogether when they were asked to remember a string of numbers while they were performing the color discrimination task. Since their resources for processing language were already occupied with the task of repeating the number string, they weren’t able to rehearse the names of the colors. Without the aid of linguistic labels, they were forced to process the colors just like the English-speaking students. This elegant experiment shows that color labels shape how people see the world of color. The Russian and English students had the same mental architecture—the same ability to perceive and process the colors in front of them—but the Russians had the distinct advantage of two labels where the English students had just one.

5. Cablinasians, Blacks, Whites, the Rich, and the Poor: Categories Resolve Ambiguity Long before children began confusing domesticated cats and ponies with dogs, humans began labeling and cataloging each other. Eventually, lighter-skinned humans became “whites,” darker-skinned humans became “blacks,” and people with intermediate skin tones became “yellow-,” “red-,” and “brown-skinned.” These labels reflected reality no more faithfully than Newton’s seven colors reflected the reality of rainbows, and if you lined up a thousand randomly selected people from across the earth, none of them would share exactly the same skin tone. You could arrange them from darkest to lightest and there wouldn’t be a single tie. Of course, the continuity of skin tone hasn’t stopped humans from assigning each other to discrete skin-color categories like “black” and “white”—categories that have no basis in biology but nonetheless go on to determine the social, political, and economic well-being of their members.

6. A group of college students watched a video of two cars colliding. Some of them were told that the cars smashed, and others that the cars hit one another. A week later they were asked to recall whether they had seen any broken glass following the accident. Almost all of the students who had been told that the cars hit each other correctly remembered that there was no glass following the accident, and only 14 percent mistakenly remembered seeing glass. But among those who had been told that the cars had smashed, almost one-third remembered seeing broken glass. For these students, the sensationalized “smashed” label had replaced reality with a false memory in which the cars spilled glass following the accident. More broadly, this disturbing result suggests that eyewitnesses to a crime or an accident are open to forming false or exaggerated memories depending on how others label the events. The moral of the story is that plaintiffs and defendants should never blithely adopt the descriptions offered by opposing counsel. An angry plaintiff’s “smash” is a persecuted defendant’s “nudge.”

7. Like names and labels, symbols lack meaning until they’re associated with existing meaningful concepts. They’re powerful because their inherent lack of meaning allows them to represent any concept from a menu of infinite possibilities.

11. We derive a lot of our competitive spirit from these sorts of mental comparisons, weighing our own performance against the performance of others, and we’re more likely to commit to the task when those social comparisons are vivid, rich, and motivating. Indeed, a similar process explains why people donate more money to charity when they focus on just one child in need, rather than the overwhelming need of millions of starving children: it’s much easier and more rewarding to commit mental and emotional energy to an easily imagined limited cause than it is to commit energy to a cause that’s so vast that your efforts are unlikely to put a dent in the edifice of need.

12. Maslow’s greatest achievement came in 1943, when he published an opus titled “A Theory of Human Motivation,” a catalog that drew heavily from his difficult childhood in describing the goals and motives that make humans tick. Maslow claimed that once humans were assured of air, food, water, and sexual reproduction—the most basic physiological needs—they would seek safety from harm, just as his parents had done when they fled czarist persecution a few years before his birth. After safety, they would seek friendship, family, and love—the social comforts that eluded Maslow as a child. When those basic needs were met, they would turn their attention to gaining respect and achieving success at work, before finally embarking on the final motive: self-actualization.

The physical world—ambient colors, locations, and weather conditions—hides in plain sight precisely because it forms a constant backdrop against which we live our ever-changing lives. Instead of consciously processing the color of every object, the nature of every room, and the temperature as it changes across time, we wisely conserve our limited mental resources for complex tasks that demand focused attention.

## The Innovator's Hypothesis: How Cheap Experiments Are Worth More Than Good Ideas
**Author:** Michael Schrage

### Highlights (13)

1. The best innovators typically run the best experiments. The best experiments are designed to generate the greatest opportunities for insight in the least amount of time.
   - Location: 598-599

2. The best business innovators typically run the best business experiments. Their experiments seek to create new value, both for their customers and themselves. Business experimentation is about identifying economic value; rapid business experimentation is about quickly identifying economic value for cultivation.

3. Experimentation is undervalued and unappreciated wherever words speak louder than actions. Period. The proliferation of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations is inversely proportional to a propensity to experiment.

4. Jim Manzi, head of Applied Predictive Technologies (APT), wrote that at Google, only “about 10 percent of these [controlled experiments, were] leading to business changes.” Former Google executive Avinash Kaushik wrote in his Experimentation and Testing primer that “80 percent of the time you/we are wrong about what a customer wants.” Mike Moran wrote that Netflix considers 90 percent of what they try to be wrong. Regis Hadiaris from Quicken Loans wrote that “in the five years I’ve been running tests, I’m only about as correct in guessing the results as a major league baseball player is in hitting the ball. That’s right—I’ve been doing this for five years, and I can only “guess” the outcome of a test about 33 percent of the time!” Etsy’s Dan McKinley observed that “nearly everything fails” and “it’s been humbling to realize how rare it is for them [features] to succeed on the first attempt. I strongly suspect that this experience is universal, but it is not universally recognized or acknowledged.”

5. When I ask people what kind of company Google is, the overwhelming majority responds: It is a search company. I tell them they’re wrong and ask a simple question to prove it: If Google could improve its search quality by an order of magnitude—10 times by whatever definition of better you value most—but you’d have to wait one hundred seconds for the results, do you think Google would become a more valuable company or less? Without hesitation, the overwhelming majority of respondents agree: “Less … much less.” The point is that Google isn’t a search company—it’s an instant search company. Google’s perceived and actual value is directly related to its search speed. (Indeed, Google implicitly brands itself this way by posting onscreen the time that it takes to perform a search.)

8. Galileo’s Tower of Pisa. Newton’s prisms. Mendel’s peas. Foucault’s pendulums. Pasteur’s flasks. Wilson’s cloud chambers. History suggests remarkably simple, cheap experiments can profoundly transform the sciences. The Innovator’s Hypothesis proposes that remarkably simple and cheap experiments can similarly transform industries and start-ups. Curiosity and ingenuity matter more than budgets. Of course, science isn’t business, and business surely isn’t a science. But the potential and power of a single experiment to radically disrupt existing perceptions and expectations is common to both. That’s as true for physics and molecular biology as financial services, retail, chemical engineering, or biotechnology.

9. Science and scientists, however, take experimenting far more seriously than business and businesspeople. The burdens of business history, culture, education, training, technology, and economic inertia deemphasize experimentation in the hearts, minds, and budgets in the enterprise.

11. investing in experiments—like investing in stocks—is a bet on the future. As Warren Buffett repeatedly tells investors, “Price is what you pay; value is what you get.” Fusing financial theory, design thinking, and constraint-based science, The Innovator’s Hypothesis is an investment guide for organizations intent on getting significantly greater value for less money, time, and risk. It’s a good bet.

12. The 5×5×5 design is simple and straightforward. A minimum of 5 teams of 5 people each are given no more than 5 days to come up with a portfolio of 5 “business experiments” that should take no longer than 5 weeks to run and cost no more than 5,000 euros to conduct. Each experiment should have a business case attached that explains how running that experiment gives tremendous insight into a possible savings of 5 million euros or a 5-million-euro growth opportunity for the firm.

13. Marissa Mayer, then vice president of Google (she is now CEO of Yahoo), described a simple experiment that the company ran to test a very important disagreement around customer desire and satisfaction. Many Googlers—and Google users—argued that they wanted more: when people did a search, more results were more desirable than fewer. More was better. In fact, Google’s search architectures made displaying more results less of a technical challenge than originally anticipated. So Mayer asked a group of Google searchers how many results they wanted to see. Almost without exception, they wanted more than the ten results that Google normally showed. So Google ran an experiment where the number of displayed results increased to thirty. The result? Traffic and revenue from the Google searchers in the experimental group dropped—by roughly 20 percent. Google gave its users what they said they wanted, but their usage of the site plummeted. What happened? After reviewing the data, the team found an uncontrolled variable. The page with ten results took 0.4 seconds to generate, but the page with thirty results took 0.9 seconds. That half-second delay caused a 20 percent drop in traffic because it undermined user satisfaction. This need for speed transcends Google’s search capabilities.

## The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic
**Author:** Dan Ariely

### Highlights (16)

1. Loss aversion is the simple idea that the misery produced by losing something that we feel is ours—say, money—outweighs the happiness of gaining the same amount of money.
   - Location: 419-420

4. • The effort that we put into something does not just change the object. It changes us and the way we evaluate that object. • Greater labor leads to greater love. • Our overvaluation of the things we make runs so deep that we assume that others share our biased perspective. • When we cannot complete something into which we have put great effort, we don’t feel so attached to it.

5. THERE IS more to revenge than merely satisfying a personal desire to get back at the other guy. Revenge and trust are, in fact, opposite sides of the same coin. As we saw in the trust game, people are generally willing to put their faith in others, even in people they don’t know and will never meet (this means that, from a rational economics point of view, people are too trusting). This basic element of trust is also why we get so upset when the social contract, founded on trust, is violated—and why under these circumstances we are willing to spend our own time and money, and sometimes take physical risks, to punish the offenders. Trusting societies have tremendous benefits over nontrusting societies, and we are designed to instinctively try to maintain a high level of trust in our society.

8. The Hedonic Treadmill By failing to anticipate the extent of our hedonic adaptation, as consumers we routinely escalate our purchases, hoping that new stuff will make us happier. Indeed, a new car feels wonderful, but sadly, the feeling lasts for only a few months. We get used to driving the car, and the buzz wears off. So we look for something else to make us happy: maybe new sunglasses, a computer, or another new car. This cycle, which is what drives us to keep up with the Joneses, is also known as the hedonic treadmill. We look forward to the things that will make us happy, but we don’t realize how short-lived this happiness will be, and when adaptation hits we look for the next new thing. “This time,” we tell ourselves, “this thing will really make me happy for a long time.” The folly of the hedonic treadmill is illustrated in the following cartoon. The woman in the cartoon may have a lovely car and she might get a new kitchen, but in the long run her level of happiness will not change much. As the saying goes, “Wherever you go, there you are.”

   - Page: 156

9. Overcoming Hedonic Adaptation Given that hedonic adaptation is clearly a mixed bag, how, you might wonder, can we use our understanding of it to get more out of life? When adaptation works in our favor (such as when we get used to living with an injury), we should clearly let this process take place. But what about instances when we wish not to adapt? Can we somehow extend the euphoric feeling of a new car, city, relationship, and so on? One key to changing the adaptation process is to interrupt it. This is exactly what Leif Nelson and Tom Meyvis did. In a set of experiments, they measured how small interruptions—which they called hedonic disruptions—influence the overall enjoyment and irritation we get from pleasurable and painful experiences.

10. The moral of the story? You may think that taking a break during an irritating or boring experience will be good for you, but a break actually decreases your ability to adapt, making the experience seem worse when you have to return to it. When cleaning your house or doing your taxes, the trick is to stick with it until you are done.

12. When we’re led to care about individuals, we take action, but when many people are involved, we don’t. A cold calculation does not increase our concern for large problems; instead, it suppresses our compassion. So, while more rational thinking sounds like good advice for improving our decisions, thinking more like Mr. Spock can make us less altruistic and caring. As Albert Szent-Györgi, the famous physician and researcher, put it, “I am deeply moved if I see one man suffering and would risk my life for him. Then I talk impersonally about the possible pulverization of our big cities, with a hundred million dead. I am unable to multiply one man’s suffering by a hundred million.”18

13. 1. We have many irrational tendencies. 2. We are often unaware of how these irrationalities influence us, which means that we don’t fully understand what drives our behavior. Ergo, We—and by that I mean You, Me, Companies, and Policy Makers—need to doubt our intuitions. If we keep following our gut and common wisdom or doing what is easiest or most habitual just because “well, things have always been done that way,” we will continue to make mistakes—resulting in a lot of time, effort, heartbreak, and money going down the same old (often wrong) rabbit holes. But if we learn to question ourselves and test our beliefs, we might actually discover when and how we are wrong and improve the ways we love, live, work, innovate, manage, and govern.

14. THE IMPORTANCE OF experiments as one of the best ways to learn what really works and what does not seems uncontroversial. I don’t see anyone wanting to abolish scientific experiments in favor of relying more heavily on gut feelings and intuitions. But I’m surprised that the importance of experiments isn’t recognized more broadly, especially when it comes to important decisions in business or public policy.
   - Location: 3949-3953
   - Page: 258

15. Frankly, I am often amazed by the audacity of the assumptions that businesspeople and politicians make, coupled with their seemingly unlimited conviction that their intuition is correct. But politicians and businesspeople are just people, with the same decision biases we all have, and the types of decisions they make are just as susceptible to errors in judgment as medical decisions. So shouldn’t it be clear that the need for systematic experiments in business and policy is just as great?

## Standard Deviations: Flawed Assumptions, Tortured Data, and Other Ways to Lie With Statistics

2. science experiment. Self-selection bias occurs when people choose to be in the data—for example, when people choose to go to college, marry, or have children. When this happens, comparisons to people who make different choices are treacherous. For example, we are often told that college graduates earn more than high school graduates, suggesting that the observed difference in incomes measures the financial return from going to college. However, part of the reason college graduates earn more may be that they are brighter and more ambitious than those who choose not to go to college. People who make different choices may in fact be different.
   - Location: 470-474
   - Page: 31

3. Self-selection bias is pervasive in “observational data,” where we collect data by observing what people do. Because these people chose to do what they are doing, their choices may reflect who they are. This self-selection bias could be avoided with a controlled experiment in which people are randomly assigned to groups and told what to do. Fortunately for all of us, researchers seldom have the power to make us do things we don’t want to do simply because they need experimental data.

4. Most Americans who have visited France more than once for pleasure in the past two years do not think the French are unfriendly. This statement is literally true, yet deceptive. There is self-selection bias in that those who chose to go back to France almost certainly had a good time on their previous visits. The false implication is that most people who go to France once want to go back. This bias is inherent in all customer satisfaction surveys. An airline once advertised that 84 percent of the frequent business travelers from New York to Chicago preferred this airline to another airline. The puzzling thing about this ad was that only 8 percent of the people flying from New York to Chicago flew on this airline. If 84 percent of travelers prefer this airline, why were only 8 percent flying on it? The answer to this puzzle is that the 84 percent figure was based on a survey of passengers who were on one of this airline’s flights from New York to Chicago. It is not surprising that travelers who choose this airline prefer it. It is surprising is that 16 percent of the passengers prefer another airline. But we can hardly expect the airline to advertise that, “Sixteen percent of the people flying on our planes wish they weren’t.”

5. In World War II, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) planned to attach heavy plating to its airplanes to protect them from German fighter planes and land-based antiaircraft guns. The protective plates weighed too much to cover an entire plane, so the RAF collected data on the location of bullet and shrapnel holes on planes that returned from bombing runs. Figure 2.1 is a stylized representation, showing most holes on the wings and rear of the plane, and very few on the cockpit, engines, or fuel tanks—suggesting that the protective plates should be put on the wings and rear. Do you agree? Figure 2.1: Which Places Need Protection? Abraham Wald, a Hungarian Jew who had fled to the United States, had the insight to recognize that these data suffered from survivor bias. Returning planes seldom had holes in the cockpit and fuel tanks because those planes that were hit there did not survive and return to Britain. Returning planes were more likely to have holes in the wings because these holes did little damage. Wald’s advice was exactly the opposite of the initial conclusion. Instead of reinforcing the locations with the most holes, they should reinforce the locations with no holes. It worked. Far fewer planes were shot down and far more returned safely, ready to continue the war effort. Wald’s clear thinking helped win the war.

6. On the television show Let’s Make a Deal, you are offered a choice of what is behind one of three doors, one a grand prize and the other two goats. After you pick a door, the host, Monty Hall, does what he always does by showing you a goat behind a door you did not choose and asking if you want to switch doors. Most people think that, because there are two doors left, your chances are now 50–50. But use your common sense. You already knew that one of the doors you didn’t choose had a goat behind it. Does it matter if Monty Hall reminds you that there is a goat behind one of these doors, or if he proves it by showing you a goat? You haven’t learned anything useful about the door you did choose. There is still a one-third chance that it is the winning door, and therefore, the probability that the last door is the winner has risen to two-thirds. You should switch.
   - Location: 1350-1357
   - Page: 89

7. Another way to think about this puzzle is to suppose that you faint after you choose Door 1. You do not see Monty open a door and you do not hear his offer to switch. When you are revived, Monty shows you what is behind the door you chose. Surely, your chances of winning are still one-third.

8. In a routine examination, you find a lump in a female patient’s breast. In your experience, only 1 out of 100 such lumps turns out to be malignant, but, to be safe, you order a mammogram X-ray. If the lump is malignant, there is a 0.80 probability that the mammogram will identify it as malignant; if the lump is benign, there is a 0.90 probability that the mammogram will identify it as benign. In this particular case, the mammogram identifies the lump as malignant. In light of these mammogram results, what is your estimate of the probability that this lump is malignant? Of the 100 doctors surveyed, 95 gave probabilities of around 0.75. However, the correct probability is actually one-tenth of that: 0.075!

9. Subject. One mature Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) participated in the fMRI study. The salmon was approximately 18 inches long, weighed 3.8 lbs, and was not alive at the time of scanning. Task. The task administered to the salmon involved completing an open-ended mentalizing task. The salmon was shown a series of photographs depicting human individuals in social situations with a specified emotional valence. The salmon was asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing. Design. Stimuli were presented in a block design with each photo presented for 10 seconds followed by 12 seconds of rest. A total of 15 photos were displayed. Total scan time was 5.5 minutes. Analysis. Voxelwise statistics on the salmon data were calculated through an ordinary least-squares estimation of the general linear model (GLM). Predictors of the hemodynamic response were modeled by a boxcar function convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response. A temporal high pass filter of 128 seconds was include to account for low frequency drift. No autocorrelation correction was applied.

10. Don’t be Fooled: If a study supports your beliefs, there is a natural inclination to nod knowingly and conclude that your beliefs are confirmed. It would be smarter to look closely and think about confounding factors. You should do the same when a study doesn’t make sense. For example, it seemed plausible that Berkeley’s graduate admissions policies discriminated against women. However, a deeper investigation intended to identify the departments that were the worst offenders found something unexpected—if anything, departments tended to favor female applicants. Women had a lower overall acceptance rate because they were more likely to apply to programs with low acceptance rates. Observational studies are inherently challenging because of the potential for self-selection bias and confounding factors. Always be wary of studies that use the data to discover the theory.

12. Don’t be Fooled: We inexorably look for patterns in data and invent explanations for the patterns we see. This is why it is so easy to be persuaded that hot and cold hands are real, with the probability of success fluctuating dramatically. Remember that eye-catching hot and cold streaks can happen by chance, even in random coin flips. Hot and cold hands probably do exist, but they are much smaller than we imagine.

13. Don’t be Fooled: When a trait, such as academic or athletic ability, is measured imperfectly, the observed differences in performance exaggerate the actual differences in ability. Those who perform the best are probably not as far above average as they seem. Nor are those who perform the worst as far below average as they seem. Their subsequent performances will consequently regress to the mean. This does not mean that the best performers are jinxed, only that their exceptional performances were assisted by good luck. Nor does regression to the mean imply that abilities are converging to the mean and everyone will soon be average, only that extreme performances rotate among people who experience good luck and bad luck. Nor does regression to the mean imply that successful and unsuccessful companies are converging to a depressing mediocrity.

14. Don’t be Fooled: When we have a run of bad luck, we hope that we are due for a change of fortune. It is unlikely that our bad luck will continue forever, but the bad things that happen to us do not automatically make good things more likely. We often have to change our behavior to change our fortune. For example, if we are accumulating a collection of job rejections, we should think about how to present ourselves better, or perhaps apply for different jobs.

15. This version of the sharpshooter fallacy is also called the Feynman Trap, a reference to the Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman, who we will meet again later in Chapter 13. Feynman asked his Cal Tech students to calculate the probability that, if he walked outside the classroom, the first car in the parking lot would have a specific license plate, say 8NSR261. Cal Tech students are very smart and they quickly calculated the probability of 8NSR261 by assuming each number and letter in the plate were independently determined. Their answer was 1 in 176 million. When they finished, Feynman revealed that the correct probability was 1 because he had seen this license plate on his way to class. Something extremely unlikely is not unlikely at all if it has already happened.

16. Don’t be Fooled: Data clusters are everywhere, even in random data. Someone who looks for an explanation will inevitably find one, but a theory that fits a data cluster is not persuasive evidence. The found explanation needs to make sense and it needs to be tested with uncontaminated data. Similarly, someone who fires enough bullets at enough targets is bound to hit one. A researcher who tests hundreds of theories is bound to find evidence supporting at least one. Such evidence is unconvincing unless the theory is sensible and confirmed with fresh data. When you hear that the data support a theory, don’t be persuaded until you’ve answered two questions. First, does the theory make sense? If it doesn’t, don’t be easily persuaded that nonsense is sensible. Second, is there a Texas sharpshooter in the house? Did the person promoting the theory look at the data before coming up with the theory? Were hundreds of theories tested before settling on the theory being promoted? If there is a smoking gun, withhold judgment on the theory until it has been tested with different data.

17. Don’t be Fooled: Be skeptical—very skeptical—of theories that seem fanciful. Watch out for unnatural groupings of data. Watch out for studies where it seems that the researchers are reporting only a carefully selected portion of their statistical tests.
   - Location: 2807-2809
   - Page: 184

18. Don’t be Fooled: A study that leaves out data is waving a big red flag. A decision to include or exclude data sometimes makes all the difference in the world. This decision should be based on the relevance and quality of the data, not on whether the data support or undermine a conclusion that is expected or desired. It is okay to correct data that were recorded incorrectly. It is sometimes okay to omit outliers. However, the best rule for researchers is, when in doubt, don’t leave it out. The best rule for readers is to be wary of studies that discard data. Ask yourself if anything is really clearly wrong with the omitted data. If not, be suspicious. Data may have been discarded simply because they contradicted the desired findings.

   - Page: 199

19. Don’t be Fooled: In a fervent quest for publishable theories—no matter how implausible—it is tempting to tweak the data to provide more support for the theory and it is natural to not look too closely if a statistical test gives the hoped-for answer. Be wary of studies where the researcher ransacked the data for a pattern and then bolstered the statistical significance by massaging or pruning data that did not fit the pattern. If a statistical conclusion seems unbelievable, check the data and the tests. Even professionals make mistakes.

21. Don’t be Fooled: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. True believers settle for less. If Arthur Conan Doyle could refuse to believe a con woman’s confession that she pretended to communicate with the deceased, so can anyone. If J. B. Rhine could conclude that a volunteer’s failure to guess cards correctly was evidence that the volunteer was guessing cards correctly, so can anyone. If Elisabeth Targ could believe that there is no harm in ransacking data for evidence that people can be healed by distant prayer, so can anyone. It is very hard to be open to the possibility of being wrong. But we should try.

23. Don’t be Fooled: Data without theory can lead to bogus inferences. For example, many comforting or alarming projections can be concocted by extrapolating a few years of data far into the future. Before being comforted or alarmed, consider whether it makes sense to extrapolate. Is there a persuasive reason why the future can be predicted simply by looking at the past? Or is that wishful thinking? Or no thinking at all? The same is true of patterns in the data. Remember that even random coin flips can yield striking, even stunning, patterns that mean nothing at all. When someone shows you a pattern, no matter how impressive the person’s credentials, consider the possibility that the pattern is just a coincidence. Ask why, not what. No matter what the pattern, the question is: Why should we expect to find this pattern? A statistical comparison of two things is similarly unpersuasive unless there is a logical reason why they should be related. Why should stock prices go up at the same rate as consumer prices? Why should inflation-adjusted stock prices equal unadjusted stock prices? There may be nothing there but a spurious correlation. Ask yourself whether the people who did the study thought before calculating. Was a coherent theory specified before looking at the data? Was the theory tested with uncontaminated data? Or were the data plundered and pillaged?

24. Modern computers can ransack large databases looking for much more subtle and complex patterns. But the fundamental problem is the same. Data without theory is treacherous. If there is no underlying reason for the discovered pattern, there is no reason for deviations from the pattern to self-correct.

25. Don’t be Fooled: Don’t bet the bank on historical patterns and relationships that have little or no logical basis. The price of gold may be 34-to-38 times the price of silver for years, but there is no reason it has to stay in that range. The US mortgage market may have been uncorrelated with the Russian bond market for years, but a panic could have similar effects on both markets. Don’t just look at numbers. Think about reasons.
   - Location: 4217-4220
   - Page: 275

26. Don’t be Fooled: We need both theory and data. Don’t be persuaded by one without the other. If somebody ransacks data to find a pattern, we still need a theory that makes sense. On the other hand, a theory is just a theory until it is tested with persuasive data. No matter who has done the study, it needs to pass the common sense test and it needs to be tested with data that are unbiased and have not been corrupted by data grubbing.

27. SEDUCED BY PATTERNS We are hardwired to make sense of the world around us—to notice patterns and invent theories to explain these patterns. We underestimate how easily patterns can be created by inexplicable random events—by good luck and bad luck. We should aspire to recognize that we are susceptible to the lure of patterns. Instead of being seduced, we should be skeptical. Correlations, trends, and other patterns by themselves prove nothing. Every pattern is just a pattern, unless there is a sensible explanation. Every sensible theory should be tested with fresh data.

28. MANGLED GRAPHS Visual displays—graphs—can help us interpret data and draw inferences. A useful graph displays data accurately and coherently and helps us see tendencies, patterns, trends, and relationships. A picture can be worth a thousand numbers. However, graphs can also distort data. Watch out for graphs that exaggerate differences by omitting zero from a graph’s axis. Remember the CEO who thought a modest decline in revenue was a crisis, until zero was put back on the axis. Be doubly skeptical of graphs that have two vertical axes and omit zero from either or both axes. A clever artist can make it seem that income has gone up much faster than consumer prices, or vice versa, by fiddling with the range of numbers shown on the axes. Watch out for graphs that omit data, use inconsistent spacing on the axes, reverse the axes, and clutter the graph with chartjunk.

## The Honest Truth About Dishonesty
**Author:** Dan Ariely

### Highlights (7)

1. our behavior is driven by two opposing motivations. On one hand, we want to view ourselves as honest, honorable people. We want to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves (psychologists call this ego motivation). On the other hand, we want to benefit from cheating and get as much money as possible (this is the standard financial motivation). Clearly these two motivations are in conflict. How can we secure the benefits of cheating and at the same time still view ourselves as honest, wonderful people? This is where our amazing cognitive flexibility comes into play. Thanks to this human skill, as long as we cheat by only a little bit, we can benefit from cheating and still view ourselves as marvelous human beings. This balancing act is the process of rationalization, and it is the basis of what we’ll call the “fudge factor theory.”

2. ON A MORE serious note, these experiments with depletion suggest that, in general, we would be well served to realize that we are continually tempted throughout the day and that our ability to fight this temptation weakens with time and accumulated resistance. If we’re really serious about losing weight, we should get rid of temptation by clearing our shelves and refrigerator of all the sugary, salty, fatty, and processed foods and acclimating to the taste of fresh produce. We should do this not only because we know that fried chicken and cake are bad for us but also because we know that exposing ourselves to such temptations throughout the day (and every time we open a cupboard or the refrigerator) makes it more difficult for us to fight off this and other temptations throughout the day. Understanding depletion also means that (to the extent that we can) we should face the situations that require self-control—a particularly tedious assignment at work, for example—early in the day, before we are too depleted. This, of course, is not easy advice to follow because the commercial forces around us (bars, online shopping, Facebook, YouTube, online computer games, and so on) thrive on both temptation and depletion, which is why they are so successful. Granted, we cannot avoid being exposed to all threats to our self-control. So is there any hope for us? Here’s one suggestion: once we realize that it is very hard to turn away when we face temptation, we can recognize that a better strategy is to walk away from the draw of desire before we are close enough to be snagged by it. Accepting this advice might not be easy, but the reality is that it is much easier to avoid temptation altogether rather than to overcome it when it sits lingering on the kitchen counter. And if we can’t quite do that, we can always try to work on our ability to fight temptation—perhaps by counting to a hundred, singing a song, or making an action plan and sticking to it. Doing any of these can help us build our arsenal of tricks for overcoming temptation so that we are better equipped to fight those urges in the future.

3. a concept that social scientists call self-signaling. The basic idea behind self-signaling is that despite what we tend to think, we don’t have a very clear notion of who we are. We generally believe that we have a privileged view of our own preferences and character, but in reality we don’t know ourselves that well (and definitely not as well as we think we do). Instead, we observe ourselves in the same way we observe and judge the actions of other people—inferring who we are and what we like from our actions.

4. So where do we stand on self-deception? Should we maintain it? Eliminate it? I suspect that self-deception is similar to its cousins, overconfidence and optimism, and as with these other biases, it has both benefits and disadvantages. On the positive side, an unjustifiably elevated belief in ourselves can increase our general well-being by helping us cope with stress; it can increase our persistence while doing difficult or tedious tasks; and it can get us to try new and different experiences. We persist in deceiving ourselves in part to maintain a positive self-image. We gloss over our failures, highlight our successes (even when they’re not entirely our own), and love to blame other people and outside circumstances when our failures are undeniable.

5. Once upon a time, two researchers named Richard Nisbett (a professor at the University of Michigan) and Tim Wilson (a professor at the University of Virginia) set up camp at their local mall and laid out four pairs of nylon stockings across a table. They then asked female passersby which of the four they liked best. The women voted, and, by and large, they preferred the pair on the far right. Why? Some said they liked the material more. Some said they liked the texture or the color. Others felt that the quality was the highest. This preference was interesting, considering that all four pairs of stockings were identical. (Nisbett and Wilson later repeated the experiment with nightgowns, and found the same results.) When Nisbett and Wilson questioned each participant about the rationale behind her choice, not one cited the placement of the stockings on the table. Even when the researchers told the women that all the stockings were identical and that there was simply a preference for the right-hand pair, the women “denied it, usually with a worried glance at the interviewer suggesting that they felt either that they had misunderstood the question or were dealing with a madman.” The moral of this story? We may not always know exactly why we do what we do, choose what we choose, or feel what we feel. But the obscurity of our real motivations doesn’t stop us from creating perfectly logical-sounding reasons for our actions, decisions, and feelings.

6. we can also take advantage of the positive side of moral contagion by publicizing the individuals who stand up to corruption. For example, Sherron Watkins of Enron, Coleen Rowley of the FBI, and Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom are great examples of individuals who stood up to internal misconduct in their own organizations, and in 2002 Time magazine selected them as People of the Year. Acts of honesty are incredibly important for our sense of social morality. And although they are unlikely to make the same sensational news, if we understand social contagion, we must also recognize the importance of publicly promoting outstanding moral acts. With more salient and vivid examples of commendable behavior, we might be able to improve what society views as acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, and ultimately improve our actions.

## The Science of Superstition: How the Developing Brain Creates Supernatural Beliefs
**Author:** Bruce M. Hood

### Highlights (18)

1. The alternative view for the origin of supernatural beliefs I want to propose is a natural, scientific one based on mind design. By design, I mean a structured organized way of interpreting the world because of the way our brains work. Yes, culture feeds each child with stories but there is more to belief than simply spreading ideas. As the forefather of modern science Francis Bacon said, we prefer to believe what we prefer to be true. I would add that what we believe to be true might come from our way of seeing the world as a child. In other words, the frame of mind within every child leads him or her to believe in the supernatural. If a supersense is part of our natural way of understanding the world, it will continue to reappear in every child born with this frame of mind. If so, then it seems unlikely that any effort to get rid of supernaturalism will be successful. At the very least, it is going to be a very hard battle to win. It will always be there lingering away in our minds. Even those with a scientific education may still continue to harbour deep-seated childish notions that lie dormant in their adult minds. Should we even try to get rid of them?

4. human psychology is littered with many examples of faulty reasoning. This is why scientists are so interested in studying the mistakes we make and our biases and logical errors. They seem to fly in the face of reason and suggest that there must be underlying mechanisms responsible for controlling our thought processes. This is the mind design that I talked about in the last chapter. The aspect of mind design that interests me is the one that leads us to infer the presence of patterns, forces, and energies operating in the world where there may be none. This is what I mean by a supersense.

6. Religion has to appeal to the supernatural and the extraordinary. Believers need that spiritual ‘X factor’ from their religion. In contrast, secular supernatural beliefs are thought to be real phenomena that science has arrogantly failed to acknowledge.

7. The difference between supernatural beliefs and scientific beliefs is that the latter produce testable hypotheses.
   - Location: 1008-1009
   - Page: 66

8. A good scientist puts forward an idea and, if it fails to stand up to rigorous testing, he or she is obliged to abandon the hypothesis and move on. That’s how science progresses – it is always moving forward. In contrast, supernatural believers either do not question their beliefs or ignore the lack of evidence. They do not move forward. In short, the major difference between scientific and supernatural belief is that scientists and believers approach the problem from two completely opposite directions when it comes to weighing up the evidence. Scientists reject beliefs until they are proven beyond reasonable doubt. In contrast, supernaturalists accept beliefs until they are disproven beyond reasonable doubt. The problem is that it is impossible to disprove anything. Logically, you cannot categorically say that something does not exist and will never exist in the future. So you cannot disprove the supernatural. That’s why most conventional scientists reject supernatural beliefs as unscientific.

10. Even at the basic input stage, our stored knowledge helps us interpret the world. For example, if I were to ask you, ‘Do you wreck a nice peach?’ I expect you would look at me quizzically. Now, if you ask this question out loud rather than reading it, you hear and understand it as ‘Do you recognize speech?’, not as an inquiry about whether you are inclined towards destructive acts aimed at pleasurable juicy fruits. You hear one interpretation and not another.

12. Most people are familiar with the word ‘theory’ in the context of science, such as Einstein’s theory of relativity or Wegener’s plate tectonic theory of continental drift. These are formal scientific theories that have been worked out, discussed, written about, tested, and argued over by hundreds of educated adults. By contrast, children’s intuitive theories are spontaneous and naive. However, children do share one interesting property with scientists. Both children and scientists are stubborn when it comes to changing their minds.

14. If I ask you to move your finger whenever you feel like it, you can sit there and then eventually decide to raise your digit. That’s what conscious free will feels like. But we know from measuring your brain activity while you’re sitting there waiting to decide that the point when you thought you had reached a decision to move your finger actually occurred after your brain had already begun to take action.29 In other words, the point in time when we think we have made a choice occurs after the event. It’s like putting the action cart before the conscious horse. The mental experience of conscious free will may simply justify what our brains have already decided to implement. In describing this type of after-the-fact decision-making, Steven Pinker says, ‘The conscious mind – the self or soul – is a spin doctor, not the commander-in-chief.’30The mind is constructing a story that fits with decisions after they have been made.

18. Psychologists have come to the conclusion that there are at least two different systems operating when it comes to thinking and reasoning.54 One system is believed to be evolutionarily more ancient in terms of human development; it has been called intuitive, natural, automatic, heuristic, and implicit. It’s the system that we think is operating in young children before they reach school age. The second system is one that is believed to be more recent in human evolution; it permits logical reasoning but is limited by executive functions. It requires working memory, planning, inhibition, and evaluation. This second reasoning system has been called conceptual–logical, analytical–rational, deliberative–effortful–intentional–systematic, and explicit. It emerges much later in development and underpins the capacity of the child to perform logical, rational problem-solving. When we reason about the world using these two systems, they may sometimes work in competition with each other. The rational system is slow and ponderous.

## Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success
**Author:** Adam Grant

### Highlights (16)

1. In purely zero-sum situations and win-lose interactions, giving rarely pays off.
   - Location: 389-389
   - Page: 26

2. But most of life isn’t zero-sum, and on balance, people who choose giving as their primary reciprocity style end up reaping rewards.
   - Location: 391-392
   - Page: 26

3. It takes time for givers to build goodwill and trust, but eventually, they establish reputations and relationships that enhance their success. In fact, you’ll see that in sales and medical school, the giver advantage grows over time. In the long run, giving can be every bit as powerful as it is dangerous. As Chip Conley, the renowned entrepreneur who founded Joie de Vivre Hotels, explains, “Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a marathon.”

4. There’s a Dutch phrase that captures this duality beautifully: “kissing up, kicking down.” Although takers tend to be dominant and controlling with subordinates, they’re surprisingly submissive and deferential toward superiors.
   - Location: 663-664
   - Page: 44

5. So far, we’ve looked at two different ways to recognize takers. First, when we have access to reputational information, we can see how people have treated others in their networks. Second, when we have a chance to observe the actions and imprints of takers, we can look for signs of lekking. Self-glorifying images, self-absorbed conversations, and sizable pay gaps can send accurate, reliable signals that someone is a taker. Thanks to some dramatic changes in the world since 2001, these signals are easier to spot today than ever before. Networks have become more transparent, providing us with new windows through which we can view other people’s reputations and lekking.

6. One of Rifkin’s maxims is “I believe in the strength of weak ties.” It’s in homage to a classic study by the Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter. Strong ties are our close friends and colleagues, the people we really trust. Weak ties are our acquaintances, the people we know casually. Testing the common assumption that we get the most help from our strong ties, Granovetter surveyed people in professional, technical, and managerial professions who had recently changed jobs. Nearly 17 percent heard about the job from a strong tie. Their friends and trusted colleagues gave them plenty of leads. But surprisingly, people were significantly more likely to benefit from weak ties. Almost 28 percent heard about the job from a weak tie. Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges: they provide more efficient access to new information. Our strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do. Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads. Here’s the wrinkle: it’s tough to ask weak ties for help. Although they’re the faster route to new leads, we don’t always feel comfortable reaching out to them.

7. The dormant ties provided more novel information than the current contacts. Over the past few years, while they were out of touch, they had been exposed to new ideas and perspectives. The current contacts were more likely to share the knowledge base and viewpoint that the executives already possessed.

11. “I tried to create a climate in the room where everybody feels that they can contribute, that it’s okay to fall on your face many, many times,” he says. This is known as psychological safety—the belief that you can take a risk without being penalized or punished. Research by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson shows that in the type of psychologically safe environment that Meyer helped create, people learn and innovate more.

12. escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. Over the past four decades, extensive research led by Staw shows that once people make an initial investment of time, energy, or resources, when it goes sour, they’re at risk for increasing their investment. Gamblers in the hole believe that if they just play one more hand of poker, they’ll be able to recover their losses or even win big. Struggling entrepreneurs think that if they just give their start-ups a little more sweat, they can turn it around. When an investment doesn’t pay off, even if the expected value is negative, we invest more. Economists explain this behavior using a concept known as the “sunk cost fallacy”: when estimating the value of a future investment, we have trouble ignoring what we’ve already invested in the past. Sunk costs are part of the story, but new research shows that other factors matter more. To figure out why and when escalation of commitment happens, researchers at Michigan State University analyzed 166 different studies. Sunk costs do have a small effect—decision makers are biased in favor of their previous investments—but three other factors are more powerful. One is anticipated regret: will I be sorry that I didn’t give this another chance? The second is project completion: if I keep investing, I can finish the project. But the single most powerful factor is ego threat: if I don’t keep investing, I’ll look and feel like a fool. In response to ego threat, people invest more, hoping to turn the project into a success so they can prove to others—and themselves—that they were right all along.

13. Research suggests that there are two fundamental paths to influence: dominance and prestige. When we establish dominance, we gain influence because others see us as strong, powerful, and authoritative. When we earn prestige, we become influential because others respect and admire us.
   - Location: 2226-2228

14. Selfless givers are people with high other-interest and low self-interest. They give their time and energy without regard for their own needs, and they pay a price for it. Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism, which is defined by researcher Barbara Oakley as “an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers end up harming themselves. In one study, college students who scored high on selfless giving declined in grades over the course of the semester. These selfless givers admitted “missing class and failing to study because they were attending to friends’ problems.” Most people assume that self-interest and other-interest are opposite ends of one continuum. Yet in my studies of what drives people at work, I’ve consistently found that self-interest and other-interest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time. As Bill Gates argued at the World Economic Forum, “there are two great forces of human nature: self-interest, and caring for others,” and people are most successful when they are driven by a “hybrid engine” of the two. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.

15. Originally, experts believed that compassion fatigue was caused by expressing too much compassion. But new research has challenged this conclusion. As researchers Olga Klimecki and Tania Singer summarize, “More than all other factors, including . . . the time spent caregiving, it is the perceived suffering that leads to depressive symptoms in the caregiver.” Givers don’t burn out when they devote too much time and energy to giving. They burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.

16. Attaching a single patient’s photo to a CT exam increased diagnostic accuracy by 46 percent. And roughly 80 percent of the key diagnostic findings came only when the radiologists saw the patient’s photo. The radiologists missed these important findings when the photo was absent—even if they caught them three months earlier. When the radiologists saw the patient’s photo, they felt more empathy. By encouraging empathy, the photos motivated the radiologists to conduct their diagnoses more carefully. Their reports were 29 percent longer when the CT exams included patient photos. When the radiologists saw a photo of a patient, they felt a stronger connection to the human impact of their work. A patient photo “makes each CT scan unique,” said one radiologist.

4. The most reliable signs of lying are in people’s voices and in their unconscious choices of language: the lack of key details in their descriptions; the increase in pauses and hesitations; the way liars distance themselves from their deceit by avoiding self-references such as “I”; the failure to describe their feelings; and the way liars seem to remember minute information that truth-tellers forget.

5. Diaconis has also written one of the seminal papers on the mathematics and psychology of coincidences, arguing that certain little-known statistical laws make some seemingly impossible events surprisingly likely. The law of large numbers is one example. Almost every week in Britain, a truly amazing coincidence takes place, an event that we know is extremely unlikely to happen by chance alone. In fact, the odds of this event’s happening are 15 million to one: Someone wins the lottery jackpot. Why does this unlikely event routinely happen week after week? Because a huge number of people buy lottery tickets. It is exactly the same with other coincidences. There are millions of people in the world living complex lives, and so it is not surprising that once in a while someone wins the coincidence jackpot and experiences a genuinely unlikely event.

6. Researchers have replicated the relationship between happiness and tipping time and again. Waiters receive bigger tips when they draw happy faces, write “Thank you” at the bottom of a bill, or give a big smile to customers.21 People tip more when the sun is shining, and even when waiters tell them that the sun is shining.22 Other studies have shown that tipping is dramatically increased when waiters introduced themselves by their first name, or refer to customers by name.23 Then there is the power of touch. Describing their work in a paper titled “The Midas Touch: The Effects of Interpersonal Touch on Restaurant Tipping,” April Crusco and her collegue explain how they trained two waitresses to touch diners’ palms or shoulders for exactly one and a half seconds as they gave them the bill.24 Both kinds of touching produced more tipping than the hands-off approach adopted in the control condition, with palm touching doing slightly better than a tap on the shoulder.

Thousands of years ago there were evolutionary advantages to hanging around with taller people because their physical size afforded all sorts of benefits when it came to gathering food and defeating foes. Although height no longer offers a physical advantage, our primate brains hold on to their evolutionary past: We still associate tall people with success, a faulty but persuasive perception that plays out in interesting ways.

8. A man in his late sixties suspects that his wife is going deaf, so he decides to test her hearing. He stands on the opposite side of the living room from her and asks: “Can you hear me?” No answer. He moves halfway across the room toward her and asks: “Can you hear me now?” No answer. He moves and stands right beside her and says: “Can you hear me now?” She replies: “For the third time, yes!”   The results were as Freud would have predicted. Younger people didn’t like these types of jokes. On average, about 20 percent of people under the age of thirty found each joke funny, versus 50 percent of people in the “sixty or over” age category. The message is clear—we laugh at the aspects of life that cause us the greatest sense of anxiety.

9. A guy goes to his priest and says, “I feel terrible. I am a doctor and I have slept with some of my patients.” The priest looks concerned, and then tries to make the man feel better by saying, “You aren’t the first doctor to sleep with their patients and you won’t be the last. Perhaps you shouldn’t feel so guilty.” “You don’t understand” says the man, “I’m a vet.”   It is a classic Freudian joke, and it revolves around one of the most basic forms of societal taboos—sex with animals. Interestingly, it obtained a very high score, about 55 percent of people finding it funny. Draw your own conclusions from the fact that men found it funnier than women, and people from Denmark found it funniest of all.

10. The second element of the Fishers’ research examined the psychological qualities associated with being funny. Several performers admitted that they were intensely curious about people and behavior, reporting how they would endlessly watch others go about their lives until they found some small idiosyncrasy that could form the basis for a new joke or routine. The Fishers noted that there were many parallels between comedians and social scientists. They argued that both groups are constantly on the prowl for novel perspectives on human behavior, the only major difference being that in the first case such insights make people laugh and in the others, they form the basis for academic papers. Having spent my career reading such publications, I would venture that this alleged distinction fails to clearly separate the two groups.

11. Vassilis Saroglou, a psychologist from the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium, who looked at the relationship between laughter and religious fundamentalism. Saroglou argues that there is a natural incompatibility between religious fundamentalism and humor.30 The creation and appreciation of humor requires a sense of playfulness, an enjoyment of incongruity (“Two fish in a tank . . . ”), and a high tolerance for uncertainty. Humor also frequently involves mixing elements that don’t go together, that threaten authority, and that contain sexually explicit material. In addition, the act of laughter involves a loss of self-control and self-discipline. All these elements, argues Saroglou, are the antithesis of religious fundamentalism, and research shows that those who subscribe to it tend to value serious activities over playfulness, certainty over uncertainty, sense over nonsense, self-mastery over impulsiveness, authority over chaos, and mental rigidity over flexibility. Saroglou supports his argument by noting that many scholars have written about the deep mistrust that exists between humor and religion, citing evidence from various religious texts.

12. The study illustrates a simple but powerful concept. We help people who are like us. Decades of experiments involving ketchup-covered students lying on the street asking for help have shown the same effect time and again. People are at their most altruistic when those in need are similar in age, background, and fashion sense. It all makes sense from an evolutionary viewpoint. People who look and behave like us are more likely than others to be genetically related to us, or at least from the same tribe, and so are seen as being more deserving of our goodwill.

2. There’s a telling difference between ‘gene trees’ and ‘people trees’. Unlike a person who is descended from two parents, a gene has one parent only. Each one of your genes must have come from either your mother or your father, from one and only one of your four grandparents, from one and only one of your eight great-grandparents, and so on. But when whole people trace their ancestors in the conventional way, they descend equally from two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents and so on. This means that a ‘people genealogy’ is much more mixed up than a ‘gene genealogy’. In a sense, a gene takes a single path chosen from the maze of crisscrossing routes mapped by the (people) family tree. Surnames behave like genes, not like people. Your surname picks out a thin line through your full family tree. It highlights your male to male to male ancestry. DNA, with two notable exceptions which I shall come to later, is not so sexist as a surname: genes trace their ancestry through males and females with equal likelihood.

2. Millions of dollars are at stake in experiments to find the optimal configuration of a website, but in clinical trials, experimenting to find optimal treatments has direct life-or-death consequences. And a growing community of doctors and statisticians think that we’re doing it wrong: that we should be treating the selection of treatments as a multi-armed bandit problem, and trying to get the better treatments to people even while an experiment is in progress. In 1969, Marvin Zelen, a biostatistician who is now at Harvard, proposed conducting “adaptive” trials. One of the ideas he suggested was a randomized “play the winner” algorithm—a version of Win-Stay, Lose-Shift, in which the chance of using a given treatment is increased by each win and decreased by each loss. In Zelen’s procedure, you start with a hat that contains one ball for each of the two treatment options being studied. The treatment for the first patient is selected by drawing a ball at random from the hat (the ball is put back afterward). If the chosen treatment is a success, you put another ball for that treatment into the hat—now you have three balls, two of which are for the successful treatment. If it fails, then you put another ball for the other treatment into the hat, making it more likely you’ll choose the alternative. Zelen’s algorithm was first used in a clinical trial sixteen years later, for a study of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or “ECMO”—an audacious approach to treating respiratory failure in infants. Developed in the 1970s by Robert Bartlett of the University of Michigan, ECMO takes blood that’s heading for the lungs and routes it instead out of the body, where it is oxygenated by a machine and returned to the heart. It is a drastic measure, with risks of its own (including the possibility of embolism), but it offered a possible approach in situations where no other options remained. In 1975 ECMO saved the life of a newborn girl in Orange County, California, for whom even a ventilator was not providing enough oxygen. That girl has now celebrated her fortieth birthday and is married with children of her own. But in its early days the ECMO technology and procedure were considered highly experimental, and early studies in adults showed no benefit compared to conventional treatments. From 1982 to 1984, Bartlett and his colleagues at the University of Michigan performed a study on newborns with respiratory failure. The team was clear that they wanted to address, as they put it, “the ethical issue of withholding an unproven but potentially lifesaving treatment,” and were “reluctant to withhold a lifesaving treatment from alternate patients simply to meet conventional random assignment technique.” Hence they turned to Zelen’s algorithm. The strategy resulted in one infant being assigned the “conventional” treatment and dying, and eleven infants in a row being assigned the experimental ECMO treatment, all of them surviving. Between April and November of 1984, after the end of the official study, ten additional infants met the criteria for ECMO treatment. Eight were treated with ECMO, and all eight survived. Two were treated conventionally, and both died. These are eye-catching numbers, yet shortly after the University of Michigan study on ECMO was completed it became mired in controversy. Having so few patients in a trial receive the conventional treatment deviated significantly from standard methodology, and the procedure itself was highly invasive and potentially risky. After the publication of the paper, Jim Ware, professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health, and his medical colleagues examined the data carefully and concluded that they “did not justify routine use of ECMO without further study.” So Ware and his colleagues designed a second clinical trial, still trying to balance the acquisition of knowledge with the effective treatment of patients but using a less radical design. They would randomly assign patients to either ECMO or the conventional treatment until a prespecified number of deaths was observed in one of the groups. Then they would switch all the patients in the study to the more effective treatment of the two. In the first phase of Ware’s study, four of ten infants receiving conventional treatment died, and all nine of nine infants receiving ECMO survived. The four deaths were enough to trigger a transition to the second phase, where all twenty patients were treated with ECMO and nineteen survived. Ware and colleagues were convinced, concluding that “it is difficult to defend further randomization ethically.” But some had already concluded this before the Ware study, and were vocal about it. The critics included Don Berry, one of the world’s leading experts on multi-armed bandits. In a comment that was published alongside the Ware study in Statistical Science, Berry wrote that “randomizing patients to non-ECMO therapy as in the Ware study was unethical.… In my view, the Ware study should not have been conducted.” And yet even the Ware study was not conclusive for all in the medical community. In the 1990s yet another study on ECMO was conducted, enrolling nearly two hundred infants in the United Kingdom. Instead of using adaptive algorithms, this study followed the traditional methods, splitting the infants randomly into two equal groups. The researchers justified the experiment by saying that ECMO’s usefulness “is controversial because of varying interpretation of the available evidence.” As it turned out, the difference between the treatments wasn’t as pronounced in the United Kingdom as it had been in the two American studies, but the results were nonetheless declared “in accord with the earlier preliminary findings that a policy of ECMO support reduces the risk of death.” The cost of that knowledge? Twenty-four more infants died in the “conventional” group than in the group receiving ECMO treatment. The widespread difficulty with accepting results from adaptive clinical trials might seem incomprehensible. But consider that part of what the advent of statistics did for medicine, at the start of the twentieth century, was to transform it from a field in which doctors had to persuade each other in ad hoc ways about every new treatment into one where they had clear guidelines about what sorts of evidence were and were not persuasive. Changes to accepted standard statistical practice have the potential to upset this balance, at least temporarily. After the controversy over ECMO, Don Berry moved from the statistics department at the University of Minnesota to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, where he has used methods developed by studying multi-armed bandits to design clinical trials for a variety of cancer treatments. While he remains one of the more vocal critics of randomized clinical trials, he is by no means the only one. In recent years, the ideas he’s been fighting for are finally beginning to come into the mainstream. In February 2010, the FDA released a “guidance” document, “Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics,” which suggests—despite a long history of sticking to an option they trust—that they might at last be willing to explore alternatives.

4. In a power-law distribution, the longer something has gone on, the longer we expect it to continue going on. So a power-law event is more surprising the longer we’ve been waiting for it—and maximally surprising right before it happens. A nation, corporation, or institution only grows more venerable with each passing year, so it’s always stunning when it collapses. In a normal distribution, events are surprising when they’re early—since we expected them to reach the average—but not when they’re late. Indeed, by that point they seem overdue to happen, so the longer we wait, the more we expect them. And in an Erlang distribution, events by definition are never any more or less surprising no matter when they occur. Any state of affairs is always equally likely to end regardless of how long it’s lasted. No wonder politicians are always thinking about their next election.

8. Being a good Bayesian means representing the world in the correct proportions—having good priors, appropriately calibrated. By and large, for humans and other animals this happens naturally; as a rule, when something surprises us, it ought to surprise us, and when it doesn’t, it ought not to. Even when we accumulate biases that aren’t objectively correct, they still usually do a reasonable job of reflecting the specific part of the world we live in. For instance, someone living in a desert climate might overestimate the amount of sand in the world, and someone living at the poles might overestimate the amount of snow. Both are well tuned to their own ecological niche. Everything starts to break down, however, when a species gains language. What we talk about isn’t what we experience—we speak chiefly of interesting things, and those tend to be things that are uncommon. More or less by definition, events are always experienced at their proper frequencies, but this isn’t at all true of language. Anyone who has experienced a snake bite or a lightning strike will tend to retell those singular stories for the rest of their lives. And those stories will be so salient that they will be picked up and retold by others. There’s a curious tension, then, between communicating with others and maintaining accurate priors about the world. When people talk about what interests them—and offer stories they think their listeners will find interesting—it skews the statistics of our experience. That makes it hard to maintain appropriate prior distributions. And the challenge has only increased with the development of the printing press, the nightly news, and social media—innovations that allow our species to spread language mechanically. Consider how many times you’ve seen either a crashed plane or a crashed car. It’s entirely possible you’ve seen roughly as many of each—yet many of those cars were on the road next to you, whereas the planes were probably on another continent, transmitted to you via the Internet or television. In the United States, for instance, the total number of people who have lost their lives in commercial plane crashes since the year 2000 would not be enough to fill Carnegie Hall even half full. In contrast, the number of people in the United States killed in car accidents over that same time is greater than the entire population of Wyoming. Simply put, the representation of events in the media does not track their frequency in the world. As sociologist Barry Glassner notes, the murder rate in the United States declined by 20% over the course of the 1990s, yet during that time period the presence of gun violence on American news increased by 600%. If you want to be a good intuitive Bayesian—if you want to naturally make good predictions, without having to think about what kind of prediction rule is appropriate—you need to protect your priors. Counterintuitively, that might mean turning off the news.

10. One way to choose among several competing models is the Occam’s razor principle, which suggests that, all things being equal, the simplest possible hypothesis is probably the correct one. Of course, things are rarely completely equal, so it’s not immediately obvious how to apply something like Occam’s razor in a mathematical context. Grappling with this challenge in the 1960s, Russian mathematician Andrey Tikhonov proposed one answer: introduce an additional term to your calculations that penalizes more complex solutions. If we introduce a complexity penalty, then more complex models need to do not merely a better job but a significantly better job of explaining the data to justify their greater complexity. Computer scientists refer to this principle—using constraints that penalize models for their complexity—as Regularization.

   - Page: 188

11. So what do these complexity penalties look like? One algorithm, discovered in 1996 by biostatistician Robert Tibshirani, is called the Lasso and uses as its penalty the total weight of the different factors in the model.* By putting this downward pressure on the weights of the factors, the Lasso drives as many of them as possible completely to zero. Only the factors that have a big impact on the results remain in the equation—thus potentially transforming, say, an overfitted nine-factor model into a simpler, more robust formula with just a couple of the most critical factors.

12. Language forms yet another natural Lasso: complexity is punished by the labor of speaking at greater length and the taxing of our listener’s attention span. Business plans get compressed to an elevator pitch; life advice becomes proverbial wisdom only if it is sufficiently concise and catchy. And anything that needs to be remembered has to pass through the inherent Lasso of memory.

13. Inspired by examples like Markowitz’s retirement savings, psychologists Gerd Gigerenzer and Henry Brighton have argued that the decision-making shortcuts people use in the real world are in many cases exactly the kind of thinking that makes for good decisions. “In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy,” they write, “the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy.” A heuristic that favors simpler answers—with fewer factors, or less computation—offers precisely these “less is more” effects.

14. As a species, being constrained by the past makes us less perfectly adjusted to the present we know but helps keep us robust for the future we don’t. A similar insight might help us resist the quick-moving fads of human society. When it comes to culture, tradition plays the role of the evolutionary constraints. A bit of conservatism, a certain bias in favor of history, can buffer us against the boom-and-bust cycle of fads.

15. In 1960, Campbell published a paper called “Blind Variation and Selective Retention in Creative Thought as in Other Knowledge Processes.” Like James, he opened with his central thesis: “A blind-variation-and-selective-retention process is fundamental to all inductive achievements, to all genuine increases in knowledge, to all increases in fit of system to environment.” And like James he was inspired by evolution, thinking about creative innovation as the outcome of new ideas being generated randomly and astute human minds retaining the best of those ideas. Campbell supported his argument liberally with quotes from other scientists and mathematicians about the processes behind their own discoveries. The nineteenth-century physicists and philosophers Ernst Mach and Henri Poincaré both seemed to offer an account similar to Campbell’s, with Mach going so far as to declare that “thus are to be explained the statements of Newton, Mozart, Richard Wagner, and others, when they say that thought, melodies, and harmonies had poured in upon them, and that they had simply retained the right ones.”

Second, from the Metropolis Algorithm: your likelihood of following a bad idea should be inversely proportional to how bad an idea it is.

17. An examination of human “backchannels” opened a whole new horizon for the field of linguistics, prompting a complete re-evaluation of the dynamics of communication—specifically, the role of the listener. In one illustrative study, a team led by Janet Bavelas at the University of Victoria investigated what would happen when someone listening to a personal story got distracted: not what would happen to the listener’s comprehension, but what would happen to the story. With poor feedback, they discovered, the story falls apart. Narrators who told close-call stories to distracted listeners … told them less well overall and particularly poorly at what should have been the dramatic conclusion. Their story endings were abrupt or choppy, or they circled around and retold the ending more than once, and they often justified their story by explaining the obvious close call.

19. When it comes to traffic of the human kind, the low price of anarchy cuts both ways. The good news is that the lack of centralized coordination is making your commute at most only 33% worse. On the other hand, if you’re hoping that networked, self-driving autonomous cars will bring us a future of traffic utopia, it may be disheartening to learn that today’s selfish, uncoordinated drivers are already pretty close to optimal. It’s true that self-driving cars should reduce the number of road accidents and may be able to drive more closely together, both of which would speed up traffic. But from a congestion standpoint, the fact that anarchy is only 4/3 as congested as perfect coordination means that perfectly coordinated commutes will only be 3/4 as congested as they are now.

20. A low price of anarchy means the system is, for better or worse, about as good on its own as it would be if it were carefully managed. A high price of anarchy, on the other hand, means that things have the potential to turn out fine if they’re carefully coordinated—but that without some form of intervention, we are courting disaster. The prisoner’s dilemma is clearly of this latter type.

21. At the present moment, the Bay Area (where the two of us live) is attempting to remedy this sorry state of affairs by going through a radical paradigm shift when it comes to vacation policy—a shift that is very well meaning and completely, apocalyptically doomed. The premise sounds innocent enough: instead of metering out some fixed arbitrary number of days for each employee, then wasting HR man-hours making sure no one goes over their limit, why not just let your employees free? Why not simply allow them unlimited vacation? Anecdotal reports thus far are mixed—but from a game-theoretic perspective, this approach is a nightmare. All employees want, in theory, to take as much vacation as possible. But they also all want to take just slightly less vacation than each other, to be perceived as more loyal, more committed, and more dedicated (hence more promotion-worthy). Everyone looks to the others for a baseline, and will take just slightly less than that. The Nash equilibrium of this game is zero. As the CEO of software company Travis CI, Mathias Meyer, writes, “People will hesitate to take a vacation as they don’t want to seem like that person who’s taking the most vacation days. It’s a race to the bottom.” This is the tragedy of the commons in full effect. And it’s just as bad between firms as within them. Imagine two shopkeepers in a small town. Each of them can choose either to stay open seven days a week or to be open only six days a week, taking Sunday off to relax with their friends and family. If both of them take a day off, they’ll retain their existing market share and experience less stress. However, if one shopkeeper decides to open his shop seven days a week, he’ll draw extra customers—taking them away from his competitor and threatening his livelihood. The Nash equilibrium, again, is for everyone to work all the time.

22. Named for Nobel Prize–winning economist William Vickrey, the Vickrey auction, just like the first-price auction, is a “sealed bid” auction process. That is, every participant simply writes down a single number in secret, and the highest bidder wins. However, in a Vickrey auction, the winner ends up paying not the amount of their own bid, but that of the second-place bidder. That is to say, if you bid $25 and I bid $10, you win the item at my price: you only have to pay $10.

24. Any dynamic system subject to the constraints of space and time is up against a core set of fundamental and unavoidable problems. These problems are computational in nature, which makes computers not only our tools but also our comrades. From this come three simple pieces of wisdom. First, there are cases where computer scientists and mathematicians have identified good algorithmic approaches that can simply be transferred over to human problems. The 37% Rule, the Least Recently Used criterion for handling overflowing caches, and the Upper Confidence Bound as a guide to exploration are all examples of this. Second, knowing that you are using an optimal algorithm should be a relief even if you don’t get the results you were looking for. The 37% Rule fails 63% of the time. Maintaining your cache with LRU doesn’t guarantee that you will always find what you’re looking for; in fact, neither would clairvoyance. Using the Upper Confidence Bound approach to the explore/exploit tradeoff doesn’t mean that you will have no regrets, just that those regrets will accumulate ever more slowly as you go through life. Even the best strategy sometimes yields bad results—which is why computer scientists take care to distinguish between “process” and “outcome.” If you followed the best possible process, then you’ve done all you can, and you shouldn’t blame yourself if things didn’t go your way. Outcomes make news headlines—indeed, they make the world we live in—so it’s easy to become fixated on them. But processes are what we have control over.

25. Up against such hard cases, effective algorithms make assumptions, show a bias toward simpler solutions, trade off the costs of error against the costs of delay, and take chances. These aren’t the concessions we make when we can’t be rational. They’re what being rational means.

26. The limitations of a classical conception of rationality—which assumes infinite computational capacity and infinite time to solve a problem—were famously pointed out by the psychologist, economist, and artificial intelligence pioneer Herbert Simon in the 1950s (Simon, Models of Man), ultimately leading to a Nobel Prize. Simon argued that “bounded rationality” could provide a better account of human behavior. Simon’s insight has been echoed in mathematics and computer science. Alan Turing’s colleague I. J. Good (famous for the concept of “the singularity” and for advising Stanley Kubrick about HAL 9000 for 2001: A Space Odyssey) called this sort of thinking “Type II Rationality.” Whereas classic, old-fashioned Type I Rationality just worries about getting the right answer, Type II Rationality takes into account the cost of getting that answer, recognizing that time is just as important a currency as accuracy.

Gazzaniga pauses. “So, just close your eyes, and draw with your left hand.” Joe picks up a marker with his left hand, which is controlled by his right hemisphere. “Just let it go,” says Gazzaniga. Joe’s left hand draws a saw. “That looks nice,” says Gazzaniga. “What’s that?” “Saw?” Joe says, slightly confused. “Yeah. What’d you see?” “Hammer.” “What’d you draw that for?” “I dunno,” Joe, or at any rate his left hemisphere, says.

6. There’s been interest in neural networks and analog computation and more statistical, as opposed to algorithmic, computing since at least the early 1940s, but the dominant paradigm by far was the algorithmic, rule-based paradigm—that is, up until about the turn of the century.

7. I’m going to give you an ambiguous sentence: ‘John babysat the child of the musician, who is arrogant and rude.’ Who’s rude?” I said that to my mind it’s the musician. “Okay, now: ‘John detested the child of the musician, who is arrogant and rude.’ ” Now it sounds like the child is rude, I said. “Right. No system in existence has this kind of representation.”

8. It turns out that all kinds of everyday sentences require more than just a dictionary and a knowledge of grammar—compare “Take the pizza out of the oven and then close it” with “Take the pizza out of the oven and then put it on the counter.” To make sense of the pronoun “it” in these examples, and in ones like “I was holding the coffee cup and the milk carton, and just poured it in without checking the expiration date,” requires an understanding of how the world works, not how the language works.

9. This is sometimes called “Andy and Bill’s Law,” referring to Andy Grove of Intel and Bill Gates of Microsoft: “What Andy giveth, Bill taketh away.” Users were being subjected to the very same lags and lurches on their new machines, despite exponentially increasing computing power, all of which was getting sopped up by new “features.” Two massive companies pouring untold billions of dollars and thousands of man-years into advancing the cutting edge of hardware and software, yet the advances effectively canceled out. The user experience went nowhere.

10. The term method itself is problematic because it suggests the notion of repetition and predictability—a method that anyone can apply. Method implies also mastery and closure, both of which are detrimental to invention.

11. “Man vs. machine” or “wetware vs. hardware” or “carbon vs. silicon”–type rhetoric obscures what I think is the crucial distinction, which is between method and method’s opposite: which I would define as “judgment,” “discovery,”3 “figuring out,” and, an idea that we’ll explore in greater detail in a couple pages, “site-specificity.” We are replacing people not with machines, nor with computers, so much as with method. And whether it’s humans or computers carrying that method out feels secondary.

14. As Matthew Crawford argues in the 2009 book Shop Class as Soulcraft, “The new frontier of capitalism lies in doing to office work what was previously done to factory work: draining it of its cognitive elements.” I would also like to note something, though, about the process by which jobs once performed by humans get taken over by machines, namely, that there’s a crucial intermediate phase to that process: where humans do the job mechanically. Note that the “blue collar and white” workers complaining about their robotic work environments in Terkel’s 1974 book Working are bemoaning not jobs they’ve lost, but the jobs they have.

17. Doc, I’m a Corpse When something happens that creates a cognitive dissonance, when two of our beliefs are shown to be incompatible, we’re still left with the choice of which one to reject. In academic philosophy circles this has a famous joke: A guy comes in to the doctor’s, says, “Doc, I’m a corpse. I’m dead.” The doctor says, “Well, are corpses … ticklish?” “Course not, doc!” Then the doctor tickles the guy, who giggles and squirms away. “See?” says the doctor. “There you go.” “Oh my God, you’re right, doc!” the man exclaims. “Corpses are ticklish!” There’s always more than one way to revise our beliefs.

20. Ramachandran explains (emphasis mine), “Most organisms evolve to become more and more specialized as they take up new environmental niches, be it a longer neck for the giraffe or sonar for the bat. Humans, on the other hand, have evolved an organ, a brain, that gives us the capacity to evade specialization.”

23. Games have a goal; life doesn’t. Life has no objective. This is what the existentialists call the “anxiety of freedom.” Thus we have an alternate definition of what a game is—anything that provides temporary relief from existential anxiety. This is why games are such a popular form of procrastination. And this is why, on reaching one’s goals, the risk is that the reentry of existential anxiety hits you even before the thrill of victory—that you’re thrown immediately back on the uncomfortable question of what to do with your life.

26. As twentieth-century philosopher Bertrand Russell argues: “Men as well as children have need of play, that is to say, of periods of activity having no purpose.” And Aristotle, who stressed the “teleology” of everything from men to microbes, went out of his way to describe the best form of friendship as one with no particular purpose or goal. Dolphins, allegedly, and bonobos are the only animals besides humans that have sex “for fun.” We also tend to regard them as the smartest animals besides ourselves. Indeed, it seems that the list of “smartest” animals and the list of animals with some form of “play” or recreation in their daily lives are more or less the same list.

27. It’s interesting that the human ability to be self-aware, self-conscious, to think about one’s own actions, and indeed about one’s own thoughts, seems to be a part of our sense of unique “intelligence,” yet so many of life’s most—you name it: productive, fun, engaging, competent—moments come when we abandon such hall-of-mirrors frivolities and just, à la Nike, do things. I am thinking here of sex, of athletics, of the performing arts, of what we call the “zone” and what psychologists call “flow”—the state of complete immersion in an activity. When we are acting, you might very well say, “like an animal”—or even “like a machine.” Indeed, “The ego falls away,” writes Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, popularizer of the psychological notion of “flow.” According to Csikszentmihalyi, there are several conditions that must be met for flow to happen. One of these, he says, is “immediate feedback.”

28. think of the great French idiom l’esprit de l’escalier, “staircase wit,” the devastating verbal comeback that occurs to you as you’re walking down the stairs out of the party.

29. Some equations (the Newtonian parabolas that projectiles follow, for instance) are such that you can just plug in any old future value for time and get a description of the future state of events. Other calculations (e.g., some cellular automata) contain no such shortcuts. Such processes are called “computationally irreducible.” Future time values cannot simply be “plugged in”; rather, you have to run the simulation all the way from point A to point Z, including all intermediate steps. Stephen Wolfram, in A New Kind of Science, attempts to reconcile free will and determinism by conjecturing that the workings of the human brain are “irreducible” in this way: that is, there are no Newtonian-style “laws” that allow us shortcuts to knowing in advance what people will do. We simply have to observe them.

30. Language is an odd thing. We hear communication experts telling us time and again about things like the “7-38-55 rule,” first posited in 1971 by UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian: 55 percent of what you convey when you speak comes from your body language, 38 percent from your tone of voice, and a paltry 7 percent from the words you choose.

Some languages actually have a term for answering questions like this, with the most iconic being the Japanese word mu that appears in certain Zen parables. “Does a dog have Buddha-nature, or does it not?” asks a student, and the master replies, “Mu”—meaning something like “All answers to this question are false.” Or: “Your question is, itself, false.” You can think of mu as a kind of “meta-no,” an “unasking” of the question, or even as a kind of “runtime exception.”

34. Many last names in America are “occupational”—they reflect the professions of our ancestors. “Fletchers” made arrows, “Coopers” made barrels, “Sawyers” cut wood, and so on. Sometimes the alignment of one’s last name and one’s career is purely coincidental—see, for instance, poker champion Chris Moneymaker,6 world record-holding sprinter Usain Bolt, and the British neurology duo, who sometimes published together, of Russell Brain and Henry Head. Such serendipitous surnames are called “aptronyms,” a favorite word of mine.

35. You can’t take the temperature of a system without the thermometer itself becoming part of the system and contributing its own temperature, in some degree, to its reading. You can’t check a tire’s pressure without letting some of that pressure out—namely, into the gauge. And you can’t check a circuit without some of its current flowing into the meter, or vice versa. As Heisenberg famously showed, measuring an electron’s position, by bouncing a photon off of it, perturbs the very thing you sought to measure through the act of measurement. Scientists call this the “observer effect.”

## Alzheimer's and Dementia for Dummies
**Author:** Consumer Dummies

### Highlights (7)

1. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines dementia thus: [A] syndrome — usually of a chronic or progressive nature — in which there is deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment. Consciousness is not affected. The impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behavior, or motivation.
   - Location: 107-111
   - Page: 7

2. The abnormally aging brain In a person with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the symptoms are more significant than those just described for normal aging. It’s not uncommon for people to notice the following: Forgetfulness Difficulty following conversations Declining ability to make sensible decisions Getting lost easily Poor concentration and attention span Those people with MCI that do progress to dementia generally follow the progression charted by the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) developed by Dr. Barry Reisberg in 1982. This score has seven stages: Stage 1: No problems identified by doctors or the patient. Stage 2: The patient recognizes that he has a problem, perhaps with remembering names, but he scores normally on diagnostic tests. Stage 3: Subtle problems carrying out thought processes start to affect work and social activities. Tests may begin to pick up problems (this is mild cognitive impairment). Stage 4: Clear-cut difficulties develop in terms of memory and carrying out tasks such as dealing with finances or traveling. Denial is common. Early dementia has set in. Stage 5: The person needs some assistance but is still quite capable of washing, dressing, eating, going to the bathroom, and choosing appropriate clothes. Forgetfulness in relation to names and places is becoming more severe. Stage 6: The person is largely unaware of anything that’s happened to him in the recent past. He needs help with most of the basic activities of daily living and may need to be looked after in a nursing home. Incontinence is common. Stage 7: By this stage the person is experiencing severe dementia. He’s completely dependent on others for everything, often including mobility. Verbal communication skills are extremely restricted. Recognizing the causes of mild cognitive impairment and taking steps to avoid it Some cases of MCI are caused by the development of similar protein deposits to those found in AD. This finding isn’t surprising, considering that those people with MCI who go on to develop dementia mostly develop AD. Other brain changes noted in MCI include worsening blood supply and shrinkage of the part of the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved with memory. No specific treatment for MCI exists and, in particular, no evidence suggests that the drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease are of any use. You can gain some mileage, however, by addressing risk factors for poor circulation by controlling your blood pressure, eating a low-carbohydrate and high-fiber diet, quitting smoking, drinking alcohol within the limits of recommended guidelines, and getting regular exercise. Increasing evidence suggests that keeping the brain mentally active by doing word and number puzzles, reading and maintaining stimulating hobbies, and social activities can help

7. British pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott (1896–1971) developed the concept of “good enough” during his work with mothers and their babies in the 1950s. He wanted to reassure these women that falling short sometimes is fine and striving for perfection is merely frustrating. According to Winnicott, a “good enough” mother does her best to give her baby appropriate attention, physical care, and emotional support and creates a safe environment in which her child can develop independence. She’s not a quitter, and when she fails at something, which she inevitably does, she gets right back in the saddle and gives it another go. In short, she demonstrates a sacrificial love that makes allowances for getting things wrong. This concept allows mothers to acknowledge feeling resentful about the stress of their role and having to put their own needs to one side in order to look after their baby, all for very little thanks. It also allows them to be annoyed with their baby at times without subsequently feeling that they’re bad mothers.

## Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It
**Author:** Chris Voss;Tahl Raz

### Highlights (34)

1. Through decades of research with Tversky, Kahneman proved that humans all suffer from Cognitive Bias, that is, unconscious—and irrational—brain processes that literally distort the way we see the world. Kahneman and Tversky discovered more than 150 of them. There’s the Framing Effect, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed (people place greater value on moving from 90 percent to 100 percent—high probability to certainty—than from 45 percent to 55 percent, even though they’re both ten percentage points). Prospect Theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. And the most famous is Loss Aversion, which shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain.

   - Page: 14

2. It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing. Psychotherapy research shows that when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. In addition, they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of view, which gets them to the calm and logical place where they can be good Getting to Yes problem solvers. The whole concept, which you’ll learn as the centerpiece of this book, is called Tactical Empathy. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do.

3. ■   A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find. ■   Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously. ■   People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible. ■   To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. ■   Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you’ve built. ■   Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart. There are three voice tones available to negotiators: 1.  The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness. 2.  The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking. 3.  The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback. ■   Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.

4. In my negotiating course, I tell my students that empathy is “the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalization of that recognition.” That’s an academic way of saying that empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world.

5. One step beyond that is tactical empathy. Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. It’s bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done.

6. tell my students that, if you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.

   - Page: 108

8. Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests, because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches. What good negotiators do is force themselves to resist this urge and take advantage of it in others. It’s not so easy. Ask yourself: What is it about a deadline that causes pressure and anxiety? The answer is consequences; the perception of the loss we’ll incur in the future—“The deal is off!” our mind screams at us in some imaginary future scenario—should no resolution be achieved by a certain point in time.

9. when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. It’s true. First, by revealing your cutoff you reduce the risk of impasse. And second, when an opponent knows your deadline, he’ll get to the real deal- and concession-making more quickly.

   - Page: 118

12. In the Ultimatum Game, years of experience has shown me that most accepters will invariably reject any offer that is less than half of the proposer’s money. Once you get to a quarter of the proposer’s money you can forget it and the accepters are insulted. Most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money.
   - Location: 1809-1812
   - Page: 118

13. By far the best theory for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called Prospect Theory. Created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people choose between options that involve risk, like in a negotiation. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion. That’s why people who statistically have no need for insurance buy it. Or consider this: a person who’s told he has a 95 percent chance of receiving $10,000 or a 100 percent chance of getting $9,499 will usually avoid risk and take the 100 percent certain safe choice, while the same person who’s told he has a 95 percent chance of losing $10,000 or a 100 percent chance of losing $9,499 will make the opposite choice, risking the bigger 95 percent option to avoid the loss. The chance for loss incites more risk than the possibility of an equal gain. Over the next few pages I’ll explain a few prospect theory tactics you can use to your advantage. But first let me leave you with a crucial lesson about loss aversion: In a tough negotiation, it’s not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.

17. ■   The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don’t get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you’re mistreating them.
   - Location: 2060-2062
   - Page: 135

18. ■   You can bend your counterpart’s reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your “real” offer seem reasonable, or use a range to seem less aggressive. The real value of anything depends on what vantage point you’re looking at it from.
   - Location: 2062-2065

20. Our job as persuaders is easier than we think. It’s not to get others believing what we say. It’s just to stop them unbelieving. Once we achieve that, the game’s half-won. “Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check,” Dutton says. “Without it, there’d be no limits.” Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions—by asking for help—is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief.
   - Location: 2215-2218
   - Page: 145

21. start with a list of words people know as reporter’s questions: “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how.” Those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively. But let me cut the list even further: it’s best to start with “what,” “how,” and sometimes “why.” Nothing else. “Who,” “when,” and “where” will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And “why” can backfire. Regardless of what language the word “why” is translated into, it’s accusatory. There are very rare moments when this is to your advantage. The only time you can use “why” successfully is when the defensiveness that is created supports the change you are trying to get them to see. “Why would you ever change from the way you’ve always done things and try my approach?” is an example. “Why would your company ever change from your long-standing vendor and choose our company?” is another. As always, tone of voice, respectful and deferential, is critical. Otherwise, treat “why” like a burner on a hot stove—don’t touch

22. The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue. Not literally, of course. But you have to keep away from knee-jerk, passionate reactions. Pause. Think. Let the passion dissipate. That allows you to collect your thoughts and be more circumspect in what you say. It also lowers your chance of saying more than you want to.

23. Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? The listener, of course. That’s because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he’s trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He’s harnessing the talker’s energy for his own ends. When you try to work the skills from this chapter into your daily life, remember that these are listener’s tools. They are not about strong-arming your opponent into submission. Rather, they’re about using the counterpart’s power to get to your objective. They’re listener’s judo. As you put listener’s judo into practice, remember the following powerful lessons: ■   Don’t try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation. ■   Avoid questions that can be answered with “Yes” or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back. ■   Ask calibrated questions that start with the words “How” or “What.” By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information. ■   Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language. ■   Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution. ■   Bite your tongue. When you’re attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question. ■   There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable.

24. the first and most common “No” question you’ll use is some version of “How am I supposed to do that?” (for example, “How can we raise that much?”). Your tone of voice is critical as this phrase can be delivered as either an accusation or a request for assistance. So pay attention to your voice.

25. There are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are defining success their way: “How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we address things if we find we’re off track?” When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s right.” Then you’ll know they’ve bought in. On the flip side, be wary of two telling signs that your counterpart doesn’t believe the idea is theirs. As I’ve noted, when they say, “You’re right,” it’s often a good indicator they are not vested in what is being discussed. And when you push for implementation and they say, “I’ll try,” you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, “I plan to fail.”

Because this really means, “I plan to fail.” When you hear either of these, dive back in with calibrated “How” questions until they define the terms of successful implementation in their own voice. Follow up by summarizing what they have said to get a “That’s right.” Let the other side feel victory. Let them think it was their idea. Subsume your ego. Remember: “Yes” is nothing without “How.” So keep asking “How?” And succeed.

27. Truly effective negotiators are conscious of the verbal, paraverbal (how it’s said), and nonverbal communications that pervade negotiations and group dynamics. And they know how to employ those subtleties to their benefit. Even changing a single word when you present options—like using “not lose” instead of “keep”—can unconsciously influence the conscious choices your counterpart makes.

28. In two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody,1 UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian created the 7-38-55 rule. That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face.

30. ■   Ask calibrated “How” questions, and ask them again and again. Asking “How” keeps your counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering the questions will give them the illusion of control. It will also lead them to contemplate your problems when making their demands. ■   Use “How” questions to shape the negotiating environment. You do this by using “How can I do that?” as a gentle version of “No.” This will subtly push your counterpart to search for other solutions—your solutions. And very often it will get them to bid against themselves. ■   Don’t just pay attention to the people you’re negotiating with directly; always identify the motivations of the players “behind the table.” You can do so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they are. ■   Follow the 7-38-55 Percent Rule by paying close attention to tone of voice and body language. Incongruence between the words and nonverbal signs will show when your counterpart is lying or uncomfortable with a deal. ■   Is the “Yes” real or counterfeit? Test it with the Rule of Three: use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It’s really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. ■   A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you’re hearing a lot of “I,” “me,” and “my,” the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of “we,” “they,” and “them,” it’s more likely you’re dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open. ■   Use your own name to make yourself a real person to the other side and even get your own personal discount. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.

34. 1.  Set your target price (your goal). 2.  Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price. 3.  Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent). 4.  Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer. 5.  When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight. 6.  On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.

## Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide
**Author:** Alex Reinhart

### Highlights (6)

1. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. —Richard P. Feynman To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of. —R. A. Fisher

3. Consider the mid-1970s movement to allow American drivers to turn right at red lights, saving gas and time; the evidence suggesting this would cause no more crashes than before was statistically flawed, as you will soon see, and the change cost many lives. The only factor holding back traffic safety researchers was a lack of data. Had they the money to collect more data and perform more studies—and the time to collate results from independent researchers in many different states—the truth would have been obvious. While Hanlon’s razor directs us to “never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence,” there are some published results of the “lies, damned lies, and statistics” sort. The pharmaceutical industry seems particularly tempted to bias evidence by neglecting to publish studies that show their drugs do not work;[2] subsequent reviewers of the literature may be pleased to find that 12 studies indicate a drug works, without knowing that 8 other unpublished studies suggest it does not. Of course, it’s likely that such results would not be published by peer-reviewed journals even if they were submitted—a strong bias against unexciting results means that studies saying “it didn’t work” never appear and other researchers never see them. Missing data and publication bias plague science, skewing our perceptions of important issues.

4. Even properly done statistics can’t be trusted. The plethora of available statistical techniques and analyses grants researchers an enormous amount of freedom when analyzing their data, and it is trivially easy to “torture the data until it confesses.” Just try several different analyses offered by your statistical software until one of them turns up an interesting result, and then pretend this is the analysis you intended to do all along. Without psychic powers, it’s almost impossible to tell when a published result was obtained through data torture. In “softer” fields, where theories are less quantitative, experiments are difficult to design, and methods are less standardized, this additional freedom causes noticeable biases.8 Researchers in the United States must produce and publish interesting results to advance their careers; with intense competition for a small number of available academic jobs, scientists cannot afford to spend months or years collecting and analyzing data only to produce a statistically insignificant result. Even without malicious intent, these scientists tend to produce exaggerated results that more strongly favor their hypotheses than the data should permit.

6. In one sample of studies published in prestigious medical journals between 1975 and 1990, more than four-fifths of randomized controlled trials that reported negative results didn’t collect enough data to detect a 25% difference in primary outcome between treatment groups. That is, even if one medication reduced symptoms by 25% more than another, there was insufficient data to make that conclusion. And nearly two-thirds of the negative trials didn’t have the power to detect a 50% difference.3 A more recent study of trials in cancer research found similar results: only about half of published studies with negative results had enough statistical power to detect even a large difference in their primary outcome variable.4 Less than 10% of these studies explained why their sample sizes were so poor.

## Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust That Society Needs to Thrive
**Author:** Bruce Schneier

### Highlights (10)

1. Societal dilemmas have many names in the literature: collective action problem, Tragedy of the Commons, free-rider problem, arms race.
   - Location: 397-398

2. And as our neocortex grew, the complexity of our social interactions grew as well. Primatologist Robin Dunbar has studied primate group sizes. Dunbar examined 38 different primate genera, and found that the volume of the neocortex correlates with the size of the troop. He established that the mean human group size is 150.14 This is the Dunbar number: the number of people with whom we can have explicit and personal encounters, whose history we can remember, and with whom we can experience some level of intimacy.15 Of course, it's an average. You personally might be able to keep track of more or fewer. This number appears regularly in human society: it's the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village; the size at which Hittite settlements split; and it's a basic unit in professional armies, from Roman times to the present day. It's the average size of people's Christmas card lists. It's a common department size in modern corporations.

3. There is an enormous amount of laboratory research on altruism, fairness, cooperation, and trust. Experimenters have subjects play a variety of bargaining games where they divide a pot of money amongst themselves, with different outcomes depending on whether or not they act in the group interest or in self-interest. These have names like the Ultimatum game14, the Dictator game15, the Trust game16, and the Public Goods game17, all with many different variants designed to tease out a particular aspect of human prosocial behavior.18 The general results seem to be that: People tend to be fair-minded.19 They routinely reduce their own rewards in order to be fair to other players. People tend to want to punish unfairness, even at their own personal expense.20 We have a sense of justice and responsibility, and we react negatively to those who act contrary to that sense. In many instances people also reduce their own reward in order to punish someone whom they perceive to be as acting unfairly. People tend to follow social or cultural norms with respect to these prosocial behaviors.21 Definitions of fairness are cultural. People are more likely to be altruistic in a game that emphasizes altruism, and selfish in a game that emphasizes selfishness. Levels of trust and trustworthiness vary across cultures. People tend to be more trusting and altruistic with people they think they know and can identify with—even just a little bit—than with anonymous strangers.22 External factors matter a lot. In experiments, people were kinder after they found a coin, traveled up an escalator (as opposed to traveling down), or watched a video of flying through clouds (as opposed to watching a video of driving on the ground).

4. Mathematical biologist Martin A. Nowak has explored the evolution of cooperation using mathematics, computer models, and experiments, and has found four different mechanisms by which altruistic behavior can spontaneously evolve in non-kin groups: Direct reciprocity. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because you'll be altruistic towards me later. Indirect reciprocity. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because my reputation as an altruistic individual will increase, and someone else will be altruistic towards me later.26 Network reciprocity. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because we are both in a group whose members are altruistic to each other, and being part of that group means that someone else will be altruistic towards me later. Group selection. Being altruistic towards you now is a good strategy because we're both part of a group whose members are altruistic to each other, and our group of altruists is more likely to survive than a group of non-altruists.

5. But while our cultures evolved, our brains did not. As different as our lives are from those of the primitive hunter-gatherers who lived in Africa 100,000 years ago, genetically we have barely changed at all.1 There simply hasn't been enough time. As Matt Ridley writes in The Red Queen: Inside my skull is a brain that was designed to exploit the conditions of an African savanna between 3 million and 100,000 years ago. When my ancestors moved into Europe (I am a white European by descent) about 100,000 years ago, they quickly evolved a set of physiological features to suit the sunless climate of northern latitudes: pale skin to prevent rickets, male beards, and a circulation relatively resistant to frostbite. But little else changed. Skull size, body proportions, and teeth are all much the same as they are in a San tribesman from southern Africa. And there is little reason to believe that the grey matter inside the skull changed much, either. For a start, 100,000 years is only three thousand generations, a mere eye blink in evolution, equivalent to a day and a half in the life of bacteria. Moreover, until very recently the life of a European was essentially the same as that of an African. Both hunted meat and gathered plants. Both lived in social groups. Both had children dependent on their parents until their late teens. Both passed wisdom down with complex languages. Such evolutionary novelties as agriculture, metal, and writing arrived less than three hundred generations ago, far too recently to have left much imprint on my mind. It is this disconnect between the speed of cultural evolution and memes—intragenerationally fast—and the speed of genetic evolution—glacially slow, literally—that make trust and security hard. We've evolved for the trust problem endemic to living in small family groups in the East African highlands in 100,000 BC. It's 21st century New York City that gives us problems.

6. Psychological studies show that we have what's called a hyperbolic discounting rate: we often prefer lower payoffs sooner to higher payoffs later. As we saw in the previous chapter, decisions to cooperate often involve putting our long-term interests ahead of our short-term interests. In some ways, this is unnatural for us.

7. Dunbar proposed several natural human group sizes that increase by a factor of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1,500—although, really, the numbers aren't as precise as all that. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationships, and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a clique: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The 12-to-20 person group is the sympathy group: people with whom you have a particularly close relationship. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from a single pool of 150 people. The 500-person group is the megaband, and the 1,500-person group is the tribe; both terms are common in ethnographic literature. Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can recognize, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society.

8. as we move from smaller group sizes to larger ones, our informal social pressures begin to fail, necessitating the development of more formal ones. A family doesn't need formal rules for sharing food, but a larger group in a communal dining hall will. Small communities don't need birth registration procedures, marriages certified by an authority, laws of inheritance, or rules governing real-estate transfer; larger communities do. Small companies don't need employee name badges, because everyone already knows everyone else; larger companies need them and many other rules besides.

## How Doctors Think
**Author:** Jerome Groopman

### Highlights (28)

1. “A lot of people look at a specialist like me as a technician. They come to you for a procedure. And there is no doubt that procedures are important, or that the specialized technology we have these days is vital in caring for a patient. But I believe that this technology also has taken us away from the patient’s story.” Falchuk paused. “And once you remove yourself from the patient’s story, you no longer are truly a doctor.”
   - Location: 246-249
   - Page: 18

2. If the patient is inhibited, or cut off prematurely, or constrained into one path of discussion, then the doctor may not be told something vital. Observers have noted that, on average, physicians interrupt patients within eighteen seconds of when they begin telling their story.
   - Location: 258-260
   - Page: 19

3. “If you know where you are going,” Roter said of doctors’ efforts to pin down a diagnosis, “then close-ended questions are the most efficient. But if you are unsure of the diagnosis, then a close-ended question serves you ill, because it immediately, perhaps irrevocably, moves you along the wrong track.” The great advantage of open-ended questioning is that it maximizes the opportunity for a doctor to hear new information.
   - Location: 263-266
   - Page: 20

4. “What does it take to succeed with open-ended questions?” Roter asked rhetorically. “The doctor has to make the patient feel that he is really interested in hearing what they have to say. And when a patient tells his story, the patient gives cues and clues to what the doctor may not be thinking about.” The type of question a doctor asks is only half of a successful medical dialogue. “The physician should respond to the patient’s emotions,” Roter continued. Most patients are gripped by fear and anxiety; some also carry a sense of shame about their disease. But a doctor gives more than psychological relief by responding empathetically to a patient. “The patient does not want to appear stupid or waste the doctor’s time,” Roter said. “Even if the doctor asks the right questions, the patient may not be forthcoming because of his emotional state. The goal of a physician is to get to the story, and to do so he has to understand the patient’s emotions.”

5. Hall discovered that the sickest patients are the least liked by doctors, and that very sick people sense this disaffection. Overall, doctors tend to like healthier people more. Why is this? “I am not a doctor-basher,” Hall said. “Some doctors are averse to the very ill, and the reasons for this are quite forgivable.” Many doctors have deep feelings of failure when dealing with diseases that resist even the best therapy; in such cases they become frustrated, because all their hard work seems in vain. So they stop trying.

6. Different doctors, as we will see in later chapters, achieve competency in remarkably similar ways, despite working in disparate fields. Primarily, they recognize and remember their mistakes and misjudgments, and incorporate those memories into their thinking. Studies show that expertise is largely acquired not only by sustained practice but by receiving feedback that helps you understand your technical errors and misguided decisions.
   - Location: 309-312

7. Every physician, even the most brilliant, makes a misdiagnosis or chooses the wrong therapy. This is not a matter of“medical mistakes.” Medical mistakes have been written about extensively in the lay press and analyzed in a report from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. They involve prescribing the wrong dose of a drug or looking at an x-ray of a patient backward. Misdiagnosis is different. It is a window into the medical mind. It reveals why doctors fail to question their assumptions, why their thinking is sometimes closed or skewed, why they overlook the gaps in their knowledge. Experts studying misguided care have recently concluded that the majority of errors are due to flaws in physician thinking, not technical mistakes. In one study of misdiagnoses that caused serious harm to patients, some 80 percent could be accounted for by a cascade of cognitive errors, like the one in Anne Dodge’s case, putting her into a narrow frame and ignoring information that contradicted a fixed notion. Another study of one hundred incorrect diagnoses found that inadequate medical knowledge was the reason for error in only four instances. The doctors didn’t stumble because of their ignorance of clinical facts; rather, they missed diagnoses because they fell into cognitive traps.

8. Croskerry said that heuristics flourish when a physician assesses unfamiliar patients, or when he must work quickly, or when his technological resources are limited. Shortcuts are the doctor’s response to the uncertainty and demands of the situation. They are the essential working tools of clinical medicine, where a doctor must combine thought and action. As Croskerry puts it, they are “fast and frugal,” the core of flesh-and-blood decision-making.

9. Of course, a doctor must know physiology and pathology and pharmacology. But he should also be schooled in heuristics—in the power and necessity of shortcuts, and in their pitfalls and dangers.

10. Yerkes-Dodson law on task performance, developed by psychologists studying psychomotor skill. It is expressed as a bell-shaped curve. The vertical axis represents a person’s “performance,” the horizontal axis his level of “arousal”—meaning the level of tension, driven by adrenaline and other stress-related chemicals. Before the ascent, at the base of the bell, there is very little, if any, tension. “You want to be just at the peak, where you think and perform the best,” Croskerry said. This point he termed “productive anxiety,” an optimum level of tension and anxiety that sharply focuses the mind and triggers quick reactions.
   - Location: 508-513

11. We all tend to prefer what we hope will happen to the less appealing alternatives; this natural tendency is termed “affective error.” We also lull ourselves into thinking that what we wish for will occur when we get the first inkling, however fragmentary, that our wish may come true. In short, we value too highly information that fulfills our desires.

12. One of the most celebrated statements in clinical medicine comes from a lecture delivered by Dr. Francis Weld Peabody of Harvard Medical School in 1925: “The secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.”

13. “No one—no doctor, no patient—should ever accept, as a first answer to a serious event, ‘We see this sometimes,’” Alter said. “When you hear that sentence, reply, Let’s keep looking until we figure out what is wrong or know the problem has passed.”

14. “I learned from this to always hold back, to make sure that even when I think I have the answer, to generate a short list of alternatives.” That simple strategy is one of the strongest safeguards against cognitive errors.

15. I recall an elderly man who arrived at the ER complaining of pain in his ankle after tripping on the street. All he wanted was to be reassured it wasn’t broken and be given a painkiller. Everyone focused on his ankle. No one thought about why he might have tripped. Only much later we learned that he’d fallen because he was weak from an undiagnosed anemia. The cause of his anemia turned out to be colon cancer.

16. An ER doctor’s “studied calm” should be apparent to a patient or his family. If the physician is distracted, frequently interrupted by other doctors, nurses, social workers, or the administrative staff as he interviews or examines you, the steady flow of his thinking may be diverted in the wrong direction. There is similar cause for concern if the physician seems rushed or breaks in as you answer a question, so that you feel he is not letting you tell him everything about your symptoms. Being quick and shooting from the hip are indications of anchoring and availability.
   - Location: 1028-1031
   - Page: 72

17. a fair question to ask an ER physician is: What’s the worst thing this can be? That question is not a sign of neurosis or hypochondria; in fact, residents are trained to keep it in mind with each patient they see. But it can easily slip from the forefront of thinking in the intense environment of emergency care. By asking that question, a patient, friend, or family member can slow down the doctor’s pace and help him think more broadly. You can prompt him to consider lifting his anchor from the most available harbor. You might also cause the rare doctor who is acting out of pique, like the resident we just saw, to stop in his tracks and revert to a professional form of behavior.
   - Location: 1033-1038
   - Page: 72

18. Another way that laypeople can focus a doctor’s attention is to ask: What body parts are near where I am having my symptom? This sounds elementary, but this query can help avoid “yin-yang out” errors. “Yes, I know that I have irritable bowel syndrome,” Maxine Carlson might have said, “and that I’ve been here many times and been told that it’s my chronic condition. But if the pain is something new, on top of that long-standing problem, what body part might be causing the symptom?”

19. This statement reminded me of a remark by an eminent academic physician-scientist who led a department around that time: “Anyone can take care of patients.” His arrogance, like much arrogance, was a product of narrow vision and ignorance. University hospitals and medical schools prize research most highly, because it brings attention from medical journals and money from grants. Similar arrogance and ignorance about medical care persist among the businesspeople who design and enforce many of the healthcare delivery constraints that dictate the fifteen-minute office visit. “A common error in thinking about primary care is to see it as entry-level medicine . . . and, because of this, rudimentary medicine—for mostly (say) the common cold and imaginary illnesses. This is a false notion,” Cassell writes. The great challenge is not only identifying serious illness but often being unable to decide if something is serious or not. “Everyone knows, however, that knowing when you don’t know requires sophisticated knowledge . . . From the perspective of training physicians and the knowledge bases required for adequate performance, the higher we go on the scale of a specialist training, the less complex the medical problem becomes.”

20. “One should not confuse highly technical, even complicated, medical knowledge—special practical knowledge about an unusual disease, treatment (complex chemotherapy, for example), condition, or technology—with the complex, many-sided worldly-wise knowledge we expect of the best physicians.” Moreover, “The narrowest subspecialist, the reasoning goes, should also be able to provide this range of medical services. This naïve idea arises, as do so many other wrong beliefs about primary care, because of the concept that doctors take care of diseases. Diseases, the idea goes on, form a hierarchy from simple to difficult. Specialists take care of difficult diseases, so, of course, they will naturally do a good job on simple diseases. Wrong. Doctors take care of people, some of whom have diseases and all of whom have some problem. People used to doing complicated things usually do complicated things in simple situations—for example, ordering tests or x-rays when waiting a few days might suffice—thus overtreating people with simple illnesses and overlooking the clues about other problems that might have brought the patient to the doctor.”

21. In medical school, and later during residency training, the emphasis is on learning the typical picture of a certain disorder, whether it is a peptic ulcer or a migraine or a kidney stone. Seemingly unusual or atypical presentations often get short shrift.

22. Specialists in particular are known to demonstrate unwarranted clinical certainty. They have trained for so long that they begin too easily to rely on their vast knowledge and overlook the variability in human biology.

23. In their book Professional Judgment: A Reader in Clinical Decision Making, Jack Dowie and Arthur Elstein assemble articles from experts with contrasting opinions about physician cognition and how to improve it. Many of the contributors are from the Bayesian school of decision-making, invoking “expected utility theory.” This theory holds that the utility of a certain outcome is multiplied by its probability, and it determines the expected utility in the face of uncertainty. The calculation, based on axioms, has the doctor choose the path with the highest number emerging from the formula. Of course, much of what doctors like Lock deal with is unique; there is no set of published studies from which decision-analysis researchers can derive a probability. Some experts contend that it is not only a unique case that makes a Bayesian approach untenable in many clinical settings. Donald A. Schön at MIT has written extensively about how professionals think, and he differs sharply from the decision-analysis camp, which relies on applied mathematics to model diagnosis and treatment—mathematics originally used to optimize submarine searching and bomb tracking, and that has been fostered by the advent of computers. The physician in the trenches, Schön emphasizes, faces “divergent situations where . . . relying on a large database to assign probabilities to a certain diagnosis, or the outcome of a certain treatment, completely breaks down.” Lock sees himself as a rational thinker, a physician who looks to logic and makes deductions. But he also understands the limits of that logic, an understanding gained from hard experience. Schön could be describing Lock when he writes: “Because of some puzzling, troubling, interesting phenomena, a physician expresses uncertainty, takes the time to reflect, and allows himself to be vulnerable. Then he restructures the problem. This is the key to the art of dealing with situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness, and value conflict.”

24. Jay Katz, a physician who teaches at Yale Law School, has examined the defenses that physicians deploy against awareness of uncertainty. He looks to the earlier work of Renée Fox, who identified three basic types of uncertainty. The first results from incomplete or imperfect mastery of available knowledge. No one can have at his command all skills and all knowledge of the lore of medicine. The second depends on limitations in current medical knowledge. There are innumerable questions to which no physician, however well trained, can provide answers. A third source of uncertainty derives from the first two: this is the difficulty in distinguishing between personal ignorance or ineptitude and the limitations of present medical knowledge.

25. Dr. E. James Potchen at Michigan State University in East Lansing has studied performance in reading chest x-rays. More than one hundred certified radiologists were assessed. These studies at Michigan State used a series of sixty chest x-rays that included duplicates of some of the films. When the radiologists were asked, “Is the film normal?” they disagreed among themselves an average of 20 percent of the time. This is called “interobserver variability.” When a single radiologist reread on a later day the same sixty films, he contradicted his earlier analysis from 5 to 10 percent of the time. This is called “intraobserver variability.”
   - Location: 2419-2424
   - Page: 167

26. One film of the sixty was of a patient who was missing his left clavicle. Presenting such a chest x-ray was meant to assess performance in noticing what was not on the film rather than merely searching for a positive finding—an exercise that points out our natural preference for focusing on positive data and ignoring the negative, as James Lock emphasized. Remarkably, 60 percent of the radiologists failed to identify the missing clavicle. When clinical data were added to the exercise, informing the radiologist that the sixty chest x-rays were obtained as part of an “annual physical examination,” which primary care doctors perform in order to screen for serious diseases like lung cancer, 58 percent of the radiologists still missed it and scored the film as normal. However, when they were told that the chest x-rays were obtained as part of a series of studies to find a cancer, then 83 percent of the radiologists identified the missing bone. This highlighted that a specific clinical cue can substantially improve performance, because the radiologist is systematically searching with attention to a particular condition, rather than relying on a flash impression. One of the most interesting outcomes of Potchen’s study using the sixty films was to compare the top twenty radiologists, who had a diagnostic accuracy of nearly 95 percent, with the bottom twenty, who had a diagnostic accuracy of 75 percent. Most worrisome was the level of confidence each group had in its analysis. The radiologists who performed poorly were not only inaccurate; they were also very confident that they were right when they were in fact wrong. “Observers’ lack of ability to discriminate normal from abnormal films does not necessarily diminish their confidence,” Potchen wrote. His study also measured the time it took to read a set of films as an indication of the observer’s decisiveness. “All observers have characteristic ways in which they manage the threshold of uncertainty in making decisions. Some people are risk takers, and they are likely to have more false-positive errors.” This means that they “overread” the images, calling a normal finding abnormal—a false positive. “Others are risk averse, and they are more likely to have high false-negative rates.” This means that their excess caution causes them to classify as normal what is actually diseased—a false negative. “Still others cannot make up their minds, and they will have high ambiguity numbers and more frequently require additional films before reaching conclusions.” Ironically, Potchen pointed out, based on his studies of radiologists, “if you look at a film too long, you increase the risk of hurting the patient.” After about thirty-eight seconds, he found, many radiologists begin to “see things that are not there.” In essence, they generate false positives and begin to designate normal structures as abnormal.

27. Those who see medicine as a business rather than a calling push for care to be apportioned in fixed units and tout efficiency. A doctor’s office is not an assembly line. Turning it into one is a sure way to blunt communication, foster mistakes, and rupture the partnership between patient and physician. A doctor can’t think with one eye on the clock and another on the computer screen. But a thinking doctor does need to allot his time wisely. Problems that are well defined and straightforward can be addressed with clarity in fifteen or twenty minutes, and a patient and family can leave the visit feeling informed and satisfied. Complicated problems cannot be solved in a rush. The inescapable truth is that good thinking takes time. Working in haste and cutting corners are the quickest routes to cognitive errors.

## Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster
**Author:** Alistair Croll;Benjamin Yoskovitz

### Highlights (50)

1. For some reason, the Lean Startup movement has proven excellent at producing bumper stickers. Odds are, if you’re reading this, you know some of our most popular additions to the business lexicon: pivot, minimum viable product, Build-Measure-Learn, continuous deployment, or Steve Blank’s famous “get out of the building.” Some of these you can already buy on a t-shirt.

2. Don’t sell what you can make; make what you can sell. And that means figuring out what people want to buy.
   - Location: 166-167

3. A startup is an organization formed to search for a scalable and repeatable business model.
   - Location: 219-220
   - Page: 15

4. We’re in the midst of a fundamental shift in how companies are built. It’s vanishingly cheap to create the first version of something. Clouds are free. Social media is free. Competitive research is free. Even billing and transactions are free.[3] We live in a digital world, and the bits don’t cost anything.
   - Location: 310-313

5. In a startup, you don’t always know which metrics are key, because you’re not entirely sure what business you’re in. You’re frequently changing the activity you analyze. You’re still trying to find the right product, or the right target audience. In a startup, the purpose of analytics is to find your way to the right product and market before the money runs out.
   - Location: 383-386

6. Misguided sales teams do this too. At one company, Alistair saw a sales executive tie quarterly compensation to the number of deals in the pipeline, rather than to the number of deals closed, or to margin on those sales. Salespeople are coin-operated, so they did what they always do: they followed the money. In this case, that meant a glut of junk leads that took two quarters to clean out of the pipeline—time that would have been far better spent closing qualified prospects.
   - Location: 428-431

7. Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, “What will I do differently based on this information?” If you can’t answer that question, you probably shouldn’t worry
   - Location: 471-472
   - Page: 31

8. Consider, for example, “total signups.” This is a vanity metric. The number can only increase over time (a classic “up and to the right” graph). It tells us nothing about what those users are doing or whether they’re valuable to us. They may have signed up for the application and vanished forever. “Total active users” is a bit better—assuming that you’ve done a decent job of defining an active user—but it’s still a vanity metric. It will gradually increase over time, too, unless you do something horribly wrong. The real metric of interest—the actionable one—is “percent of users who are active.” This is a critical metric because it tells us about the level of engagement your users have with your product. When you change something about the product, this metric should change, and if you change it in a good way, it should go up. That means you can experiment, learn, and iterate with it.

9. Eight Vanity Metrics to Watch Out For It’s easy to fall in love with numbers that go up and to the right. Here’s a list of eight notorious vanity metrics you should avoid. Number of hits. This is a metric from the early, foolish days of the Web. If you have a site with many objects on it, this will be a big number. Count people instead. Number of page views. This is only slightly better than hits, since it counts the number of times someone requests a page. Unless your business model depends on page views (i.e., display advertising inventory), you should count people instead. Number of visits. Is this one person who visits a hundred times, or are a hundred people visiting once? Fail. Number of unique visitors. All this shows you is how many people saw your home page. It tells you nothing about what they did, why they stuck around, or if they left. Number of followers/friends/likes. Counting followers and friends is nothing more than a popularity contest, unless you can get them to do something useful for you. Once you know how many followers will do your bidding when asked, you’ve got something. Time on site/number of pages. These are a poor substitute for actual engagement or activity unless your business is tied to this behavior. If customers spend a lot of time on your support or complaints pages, that’s probably a bad thing. Emails collected. A big mailing list of people excited about your new startup is nice, but until you know how many will open your emails (and act on what’s inside them), this isn’t useful. Send test emails to some of your registered subscribers and see if they’ll do what you tell them. Number of downloads. While it sometimes affects your ranking in app stores, downloads alone don’t lead to real value. Measure activations, account creations, or something else.

10. When your initial offering—your minimum viable product—is in the market and you’re acquiring early-adopter customers and testing their use of your product, you won’t even know how they’re going to use it (although you’ll have assumptions). Sometimes there’s a huge gulf between what you assume and what users actually do. You might think that people will play your multiplayer game, only to discover that they’re using you as a photo upload service. Unlikely? That’s how Flickr got started.

11. Cohort experiments that compare groups like the one in Table 2-2 are called longitudinal studies, since the data is collected along the natural lifespan of a customer group. By contrast, studies in which different groups of test subjects are given different experiences at the same time are called cross-sectional studies. Showing half of the visitors a blue link and half of them a green link in order to see which group is more likely to click that link is a cross-sectional study. When we’re comparing one attribute of a subject’s experience, such as link color, and assuming everything else is equal, we’re doing A/B testing.

12. You might want to test the color of a web page, the text in a call to action, and the picture you’re showing to visitors. Rather than running a series of separate tests one after the other—which will delay your learning cycle—you can analyze them all at once using a technique called multivariate analysis. This relies on statistical analysis of the results to see which of many factors correlates strongly with an improvement in a key metric.

16. Ash says you should consider the following: Problem: Have you identified real problems people know they have? Customer segments: Do you know your target markets? Do you know how to target messages to them as distinct groups? Unique value proposition: Have you found a clear, distinctive, memorable way to explain why you’re better or different? Solution: Can you solve the problems in the right way? Channels: How will you get your product or service to your customers, and their money back to you? Revenue streams: Where will the money come from? Will it be onetime or recurring? The result of a direct transaction (e.g., buying a meal) or something indirect (magazine subscriptions)? Cost structure: What are the direct, variable, and indirect costs you’ll have to pay for when you run the business? Metrics: Do you know what numbers to track to understand if you’re making progress? Unfair advantage: What is the “force multiplier” that will make your efforts have greater impact than your competitors?

17. Bud’s diagram shows three overlapping rings: what you like to do, what you’re good at, and what you can be paid to do. For each intersection between rings, he suggests a course of action: If you want to do something and are good at it, but can’t be paid to do it, learn to monetize. If you’re good at something and can be paid to do it, but don’t like doing it, learn to say no. If you like to do something and can be paid to do it, but aren’t very good at it, learn to do it well. This isn’t just great advice for career counselors; when launching a new venture, you need to properly assess these three dimensions as well.

18. To understand the problem with constrained optimization, imagine that you’re given three wheels and asked to evolve the best, most stable vehicle. After many iterations of pitting different wheel layouts against one another, you come up with a tricycle-like configuration. It’s the optimal three-wheeled configuration. Data-driven optimization can perform this kind of iterative improvement. What it can’t do, however, is say, “You know what? Four wheels would be way better!” Math is good at optimizing a known system; humans are good at finding a new one. Put another way, change favors local maxima; innovation favors global disruption.

20. HOW TO USE A LEAN CANVAS Unlike a traditional business plan, you should use and update the Lean Canvas continuously. It’s a “living, breathing” plan, not a hypothetical tome of nonsense that you throw out the minute you start actually working on your startup. Once you’ve filled out the Lean Canvas (or most of it), you start running experiments to validate or invalidate what you’ve hypothesized. In its simplest form, think of each box as a “pass/fail”:if your experiments fail, you don’t go to the next box; rather, you keep experimenting until you hit a wall completely or get to the next step. The only exception is the “Key metrics” box, which is meant to keep a record of the most important metrics you’re tracking. You don’t run experiments on this box, but it’s important to fill it out anyway because it’s definitely open to debate and discussion.

21. Sean Ellis’s Startup Growth Pyramid Sean Ellis is a well-known entrepreneur and marketer. He coined the term growth hacker and has been heavily involved with a number of meteoric-growth startups, including Dropbox, Xobni, LogMeIn (IPO), and Uproar (IPO). His Startup Growth Pyramid, shown in Figure 5-2, focuses on what to do after you’ve achieved product/market fit. Figure 5-2. Like building, real pyramid, startup growth is back-breaking labor The question this poses a of course, is how do you know if you’ve achieved product/market fit? Sean devised a simple survey that you can send customers (available at survey.io) to determine if you’re ready for accelerated growth. The most important question in the survey is “How would you feel if you could no longer use this product or service?” In Sean’s experience, if 40% of people (or more) say they’d be very disappointed to lose the service, you’ve found a fit, and now it’s time to scale.

22. You’ll always track and review multiple numbers. Some will be important: these are your key performance indicators (KPIs), which you’ll track and report every day. Others will be stored away for future use, such as when it’s time to tell the company history to an investor or to make an infographic. Setting up and managing instrumentation is fairly easy these days with tools like Geckoboard, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Totango, Chartbeat, and others. But don’t let your ability to track so many things distract you. Capture everything, but focus on what’s important.

24. As a startup, you have a wide range of payment and incentive models from which to choose: freemium, free trial, pay up-front, discount, ad-funded, and so on. Your choice needs to match the kind of segmentation you’re doing, the time it takes for a user to become a paying customer, how easy it is to use your service, and how costly an additional drive-by user is to the business. Not all customers are good. Don’t fall victim to customer counting. Instead, optimize for good customers and segment your activities based on the kinds of customer those activities attract.

25. A product is more than the thing you buy. It’s the mix of service, branding, fame, street cred, support, packaging, and myriad other factors you pay for. When you purchase an iPhone, you’re also getting a tiny piece of Steve Jobs’s persona. In the same way, a business model is a combination of things. It’s what you sell, how you deliver it, how you acquire customers, and how you make money from them.

30. One of the telltale signs that a problem is worth solving is when a lot of people are already trying to solve it or have tried to do so in the past. People will go to amazing lengths to solve really painful problems that matter to them. Typically, they’re using another product that wasn’t meant to solve their problem, but it’s “good enough,” or they’ve built something themselves.

31. Too often, idealistic startups underestimate a market’s inertia. They attack market leaders with features, functionality, and strategies that aren’t meaningful enough to customers. Their MVP has too much “minimum” to provoke a change. They assume that what they’re doing—whether it’s a slicker UI, simpler system, social functionality, or something else—is an obvious win. Then “good enough” bites them in the ass. The bar for startups to succeed at any real scale is much higher than that of the market leaders.

32. Twitter’s Advanced Search For startups, Twitter is a goldmine. Its asymmetric nature—I can follow you, but you don’t have to follow me back—and relatively unwalled garden means people expect interactions. And we’re vain; if you mention someone, he’ll probably come find out what you said and who you are. Provided you don’t abuse this privilege, it’s a great way to find people. Let’s say you’re building a product for lawyers and want to talk to people nearby. Put keywords and location information into Twitter’s Advanced Search, as shown in Figure 15-3. Figure 15-3. Using Twitter’s Advanced Search to stalk people You’ll get a list of organizations and people who might qualify similar to the one in Figure 15-4. Now, if you’re careful, you can reach out to them. Don’t spam them; get to know them a bit, see where they live and what they say, and when they mention something relevant—or when you feel comfortable doing so—speak up. Just mention them by name, invite them to take a survey, and so on. There are other interesting tools for digging into Twitter and finding people. Moz has a tool called Followerwonk, and there’s also the freely available people search engine, Twellow.

33. To talk with people at scale you can employ a number of tactics, including surveys and landing pages. These give you the opportunity to reach a wider audience and build a stronger, data-driven case for the qualitative feedback you received during interviews. LikeBright “Mechanical Turks” Its Way into TechStars LikeBright is an early-stage startup in the dating space that joined the TechStars Seattle accelerator program in 2011. But it wasn’t an easy road. Founder Nick Soman says that at first Andy Sack, managing director of the Seattle program, rejected LikeBright, saying, “We don’t think you understand your customer well enough.” With the application deadline looming, Andy gave Nick a challenge: go speak to 100 single women about their frustrations with dating, and then tell TechStars what he’d learned. Nick was stuck. How was he going to speak with that many women quickly enough? He didn’t think it was possible, at least not easily. And then he decided to run an experiment with Mechanical Turk.[53] Mechanical Turk is a service provided by Amazon that allows you to pay small amounts of money for people to complete simple tasks. It’s often used to get quick feedback on things like logos and color choices, or to perform small tasks such as tagging a picture or flagging spam. The idea was to use Mechanical Turk to survey 100 single women, putting out a task (or what Mechanical Turk calls a HIT) asking women (who fit a particular profile) to call Nick. In exchange he paid them $2. The interviews typically lasted 10–15 minutes. “In my research, I found that there’s a good cross-section of people on Mechanical Turk,” says Nick. “We found lots of highly educated, diverse women that were very willing to speak with us about their dating experiences.” Nick set up several Google Voice phone numbers (throwaway numbers that couldn’t be tracked or reused) and recruited a few friends to help him out. He prepared a simple interview script with open-ended questions, since he was digging into the problem validation stage of his startup. Nick says, “I was amazed at the feedback I got. We were able to speak with 100 single women that met our criteria in four hours on one evening.”

34. Facebook has an advertising platform for reaching very targeted groups of people. You can segment your audience by demographics, interests, and more. Although the click-through rate on Facebook ads is extremely low, you’re not necessarily looking for volume at this stage. Finding 20 or 30 people to speak with is a great start, plus you can test messaging this way, through the ads you publish, as well as the subsequent landing pages you have to encourage people to connect with you. You can advertise on LinkedIn to very targeted audiences. This will cost you some money, but if you’ve identified a good audience of people through searching

35. Google makes it really easy to target campaigns. If you want to promote a survey or signup on the Web, you can do so with remarkable precision. In the first step of setting up an AdWords campaign, you get to specify the location, language, and other information that targets the ad, as shown in Figure 15-7. Figure 15-7. Some of the ways you can control who sees your ad Once you’ve done that, you can create your message, using a screen like the one in Figure 15-8. This is an excellent way to try out different taglines and approaches: even the ones that don’t get clicks show you something, because you know what not to say. Try different appeals to basic emotions: fear, greed, love, wealth, and so on. Learn what gets people clicking and what keeps them around long enough to fill out a survey or submit an email.

36. What kind of uncertainty are you trying to quantify by doing a survey? If you’re asking what existing brands come to mind in a particular industry, will you use this information to market alongside them? Address competitive threats? Choose partners? If you’re asking how customers try to find a product or service, will this inform your marketing campaigns and choice of media? If you’re asking how much money people spend on a problem you’re planning to address, how will this shape your pricing strategy? If you’re testing which tagline or unique value proposition resonates best with customers, will you choose the winning one, or just take that as advice? Don’t just ask questions. Know how the answers to the questions will change your behavior. In other words, draw a line in the sand before you run the survey. Your earlier problem interviews showed you an opportunity; now, you’re checking to see whether that opportunity exists in the market as a whole. For each quantifiable question, decide what would be a “good” score. Write it down somewhere so you’ll remember.

37. Survey Design Your survey should include three kinds of questions: Demographics and psychographics you can use to segment the responses, such as age, gender, or Internet usage. Quantifiable questions that you can analyze statistically, such as ratings, agreement or disagreement with a statement, or selecting something from a list. Open-ended questions that allow respondents to add qualitative data. Always ask the segmentation questions up front and the open-ended ones at the end.

38. Test the Survey Before sending it out, try the survey on people who haven’t seen it. You’ll almost always find they get stuck or don’t understand something. You’re not ready to send the survey out until at least three people who haven’t seen it, and are in your target market, can complete it without questions and then explain to you what each question meant. This is no exaggeration: everyone gets surveys wrong.
   - Location: 4305-4309
   - Page: 281

39. Send the Survey Out You want to reach people you don’t know. You could tweet out a link to the survey form or landing page, but you’ll naturally get respondents who are in your extended social circle. This is a time when it makes sense to pay for access to a new audience. Design several ads that link to the survey. They can take several forms: Name the audience you’re targeting. (“Are you a single mom? Take this brief survey and help us address a big challenge.”) Mention the problem you’re dealing with. (“Can’t sleep? We’re trying to fix that, and want your input.”) Mention the solution or your unique value proposition, without a sales pitch. (“Our accounting software automatically finds tax breaks. Help us plan the product roadmap.”) Be careful not to lead the witness; don’t use this if you’re still trying to settle on positioning. Remember, too, that the first question you’re asking is “Was my message compelling enough to convince them to take the survey?” You’re trying out a number of different value propositions. In some cases, you don’t even care about a survey—we know one entrepreneur who tried out various taglines, all of which pointed to a spam site. All he needed to know was which one got the most clicks, and he didn’t want to tell anyone who he was yet. You can also use mailing lists. Some user groups or newsletters may be willing to feature you on their page or in a mail-out if what you’re doing is relevant to their audience.

40. Collect the Information When you run the survey, measure your cost per completed response. Do a small test of a few dozen responses first. If your numbers are low, check whether people are abandoning on a particular form field—some analytics tools like ClickTale let you do this. Then remove that field and see if completion rates go up. You can also try breaking up the survey into smaller ones, asking fewer questions, or changing your call to action. While you’re collecting information, don’t forget to also request permission to contact respondents and collect contact information. If you’ve found a workable solution to a real problem, some of them may become your beta customers.

41. Analyze the Data Finally, crunch the data properly. You’re actually looking at three things. First, were you able to capture the attention of the market? Did people click on your ads and links? Which ones worked best? Second, are you on the right track? What decisions can you now make with the data you’ve collected? Third, will people try out your solution/product? How many of your respondents were willing to be contacted? How many agreed to join a forum or a beta? How many asked for access in their open-ended responses? Statistics are important here. Don’t skimp on the math—make sure you learn everything you can from your efforts. Calculate the average, mean, and standard deviation of the quantifiable questions. Which slogan won? Which competitor is most common? Was there a clear winner, or was the difference marginal? Analyze each quantifiable question by each segment to see if a particular group of your respondents answered differently. Use pivot tables for this kind of analysis (see the upcoming sidebar What’s a Pivot Table? for details); you’ll quickly see if a particular response correlated to a particular group. This will help you focus your efforts or see where one set of answers is skewing the rest.

42. WHAT’S A PIVOT TABLE? Most of us have used a spreadsheet. But if you want to take your analytical skills to the next level, you need to move up to pivot tables. This feature lets you quickly analyze many rows of data as if it were a database, without, well, the database.

43. Before You Launch the MVP As you’re building your bare-minimum product—just enough functionality to test the risks you’ve identified in the Empathy stage—you’ll continue to gather feedback (in the form of surveys) and acquire early adopters (through a beta enrollment site, social media, and other forms of teasing). In this way, by the time you launch the MVP you’ll have a critical mass of testers and early adopters eager to give you feedback. You’re farming test subjects. Your OMTM at this point is enrollments, social reach, and other indicators that you’ll be able to drive actual users to your MVP so you can learn and iterate quickly. This is the reverse Field of Dreams moment: if they come, you will build it.
   - Location: 4497-4503
   - Page: 294

44. Deciding What Goes into the MVP Take all of your solution interviews, quantitative analysis, and “hacks,” and decide what feature set to launch for your MVP. The MVP has to generate the value you’ve promised to users and customers. If it’s too shallow, people will be disinterested and disappointed. If it’s too bloated, people will be confused and frustrated. In both cases, you’ll fail. It’s important to contrast an MVP with a smoke-test approach where you build a teaser site—for example, a simple page generated in LaunchRock with links to social networks. With a smoke-test page, you’re testing the risk that the message isn’t compelling enough to get signups. With the MVP, you’re testing the risk that the product won’t solve a need that people want solved in a way that will make them permanently change their behavior. The former tests the problem messaging; the latter, the solution effectiveness.
   - Location: 4510-4517
   - Page: 295

45. It’s important to note that the MVP is a process, not a product. This is something we learned at Year One Labs working with multiple startups all at a similar stage. The knee-jerk reaction once you’ve decided on the feature set is to build it and gun for traction as quickly as possible, turning on all the marketing tactics possible. As much as we all understand that seeing our name in lights on a popular tech blog doesn’t really make a huge difference, it’s still great when it’s there. But sticking with Lean Startup’s core tenet—build→measure→learn—it’s important to realize that an MVP will go through numerous iterations before you’re ready to go to the next step.
   - Location: 4521-4525
   - Page: 295

46. Iterating on your MVP is difficult, tedious work. It’s methodical. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like innovation. Iterations are evolutionary; pivots are revolutionary. This is one of the reasons founders get frustrated and decide instead to pivot repeatedly in the hopes that something will accidentally engage their users. Resist that temptation.

48. How to Handle User Feedback Customers have something in common with entrepreneurs—they’re liars too. They don’t lie intentionally, but often they forget how your product really works or what they were doing in the product. Many of the reviews for personal banking app Mint give the product one star, saying, “Warning! This product will try to collect your banking information and connect to your bank account!” as shown in Figure 16-2. But that’s what Mint is for. Figure 16-2. Warning—banking app may want your banking details If you’re the product manager, you might be tempted to ignore this feedback, but what it’s really telling you is that your marketing and product descriptions aren’t working, bringing down your product ratings and reducing your addressable market. Customers may give you feedback you don’t like. Just remember that they don’t have the same mental model you do, they aren’t in your target market. They often lack training to use your product properly. We’ve already seen some of the cognitive biases demonstrated by interview subjects. Existing users suffer from similar biases. They have different expectations and context from you. You need to view their feedback with that in mind. For one thing, user feedback suffers from horrible sampling bias. Few people provide feedback when they have a predictable, tepid experience. They reach out when they’re ecstatic or furious. If they’re feeling aggrieved, you’ll hear from them. What’s more, they don’t know their value to you. They may feel entitled to a free product because that’s how you’ve positioned your SaaS offering, or to free breadsticks because that’s how you’ve priced your buffet. You know their value to your business—they don’t. To each unhappy user he or she is, they’re the most important person in the world. And he or she has been wronged or celebrated. Finally, customers aren’t aware of the constraints and nuances of their problems. It’s easy to complain about US television programming not being available overseas; it’s unlikely that those complaining are aware of the intricacies of foreign currency exchange, censorship, and copyright licensing. They want their problem solved, but they have little insight into how to solve it the right way.

49. The Problem-Solution Canvas At Year One Labs, we developed a tool called the Problem-Solution Canvas to help our startups maintain discipline and focus on a weekly basis. It’s inspired by Ash Maurya’s Lean Canvas, but focused on the day-to-day operations of a startup. We used it to home in on the key one to three problems the startups were facing. It allowed us all to agree on those problems and prioritize them.

## Defeating the Devil's Advocate
**Author:** Jonathan Littman;Thomas Kelley

### Highlights (36)

1. W. L. Gore & Associates, most famous for its breathable Gore-Tex fabrics, not only manufactures a tremendous breadth of products—everything from guitar strings to artificial blood vessels—it also distinguishes itself through its egalitarian, team-based organization. Eschewing bosses and job descriptions, Gore creates idea-friendly environments that work to generate a continual stream of clever innovations. Gore was recently cited as “the most innovative company in America,” and is ranked among the best places to work in Germany, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

5. The Learning Personas Individuals and organizations need to constantly gather new sources of information in order to expand their knowledge and grow, so the first three personas are learning roles. These personas are driven by the idea that no matter how successful a company currently is, no one can afford to be complacent. The world is changing at an accelerated pace, and today’s great idea may be tomorrow’s anachronism. The learning roles help keep your team from becoming too internally focused and remind the organization not to be so smug about what you “know.” People who adopt the learning roles are humble enough to question their own worldview, and in doing so they remain open to new insights every day.
   - Location: 156-162
   - Page: 11

6. The Organizing Personas The next three personas are organizing roles, played by individuals who are savvy about the often counterintuitive process of how organizations move ideas forward. At IDEO, we used to believe that the ideas should speak for themselves. Now we understand what the Hurdler, the Collaborator, and the Director have known all along: that even the best ideas must continuously compete for time, attention, and resources. Those who adopt these organizing roles don’t dismiss the process of budget and resource allocation as “politics” or “red tape.” They recognize it as a complex game of chess, and they play to win.
   - Location: 173-178
   - Page: 12

7. The Building Personas The four remaining personas are building roles that apply insights from the learning roles and channel the empowerment from the organizing roles to make innovation happen. When people adopt the building personas, they stamp their mark on your organization. People in these roles are highly visible, so you’ll often find them right at the heart of the action.

9. I happened to visit the space one day and was struck by a Henry Ford quote the team had posted on the wall. “If I had asked my customers what they wanted,” said the inventive Mr. Ford, “they’d have said a faster horse.” Ford had a point. Don’t expect customers to help you envision the future. Make that mistake and you’re likely to get lots of suggestions for “faster horses.”
   - Location: 606-609
   - Page: 40

10. Ford achieved many of his best breakthroughs in the early years of the twentieth century, but imagine you worked for a consumer electronics company that manufactured videocassette recorders in the first years of the twenty-first century. If you’d asked people what they wanted in a VCR, and let the question hang in the air awhile, they might eventually have suggested something like “super-fast rewind.” You can imagine a customer saying, “When I am done watching a movie, I want to take it back to Blockbuster as soon as possible, so please give me faster rewinding!” How could you fail by listening to your customer? You might set out to create the fastest-rewinding VCR in the world. But just as you released your fancy new model, you would have been blown away by the arrival of the first DVD players—which, along with sporting superior image quality, sound, capacity, and improved reliability, require no rewinding at all! And as the pace of innovation accelerates, I hope everyone associated with the DVD format is preparing for subsequent innovations involving downloadable movies or video on demand, which will inevitably eclipse the same DVD players that had previously disrupted VCRs. Of course, good companies still make a habit of listening to their customers. Just don’t confuse that proven business practice with how you go about hunting up the next big breakthrough. That’s not likely to come from asking people what needs improvement or fine-tuning. It’s probably going to be something your customers haven’t even thought of.

11. We celebrate the Wright Brothers’ success at Kitty Hawk, but we often overlook the fact that they tested more than 200 wing shapes and risked their lives crashing seven different flying machines in pursuit of a practical airplane. Few people stop to consider where the name for the ubiquitous spray lubricant WD-40 came from, but it refers to the thirty-nine failed experiments in coming up with the perfect water-displacement formula before the company finally achieved success. And British entrepreneur James Dyson reports that he built 5,127 unsuccessful prototypes of his cyclone vacuum before he hit on the design that made him a billionaire.

12. Experimenters love to play, to try different ideas and approaches. They put roller skates on the scientific method. They make sure everything’s faster, less expensive, and hopefully more fun. Speed is an Experimenter’s best friend. Experimenters embrace little failures at the early stages to avoid big mistakes later on. They work with teams of all shapes and sizes. They invite in colleagues, partners, customers, investors, even kids to try out their works-in-process—all the possible stakeholders who might have insights that could make the prototype better. Who exactly is an Experimenter? At IDEO, we think it’s someone who makes ideas tangible—dashing off sketches, cobbling together creations of duct tape and foam core, shooting quick videos to give personality and shape to a new service concept. Experimenting in our world typically means prototyping, and prototyping is central to the IDEO tool set, as essential as a hammer is for a carpenter. Without the discipline of prototyping, we couldn’t put flesh and bones on many of our new ideas. We’ve been prototyping so long that it comes naturally. That said, in the last few years we’ve learned a few more things about the art of prototyping. First, you can prototype just about everything. Today, we prototype services as well as new products. Virtually every step along the ideation path can be prototyped—not just at the development stage, but also marketing, distribution, even sales.
   - Location: 649-660
   - Page: 43

13. The trouble with a lone prototype is that if you show someone your one-and-only bright proposal and ask expectantly, “What do you think?” their answer is muddied by what they think about you. If they’re a friend, they’ll likely shower you with encouragement regardless of the idea’s merit. But suggest an idea to your nemesis, and you’re bound to be met by a withering “I don’t get it!?!” At IDEO, we always try to present more than one prototype to guard against such fruitless responses. Battle-hardened Experimenters know that a variety of options makes possible a much more frank and positive discussion about the pros and cons of a prospective idea. Here’s an example from outside the business world that may have a familiar ring. After dinner one evening, my wife says, “Honey, I bought a new outfit today,” and disappears into the next room to try it on. A few minutes later, she returns in the new dress. “Well, what do you think?” Of course, it’s a charged question. You’ve gotta love that dress, right? It’s still a prototype, since the sales tags are still on it, and it’s still fully returnable, but that’s not the point. She’s asking about the dress—with her in it. She picked it out, tried it on, paid for it, and brought it home. I’ve gotta like that dress, because she’s already committed to that choice. With only one option on the table, I’m either on her side or I’m not. Experimenters recognize the value of introducing multiple prototypes. They transform the situation. Imagine that instead of just seeing the one chosen dress at the end, you have a chance to see seven dresses earlier in the process, as your wife hauls them into the department store dressing room. On the way in, she pauses to ask what you think. This time, flipping through the options, you can pick out the same exact dress and say, “Honey, I don’t think this one will look good on you.” Explain why it’s not the ideal if you like, but that’s rarely necessary. You’re not saying she might not look great in one of the other dresses. Why can you speak the truth? Because you’re not trapped in an awkward situation where someone you care about has already put all their eggs in one basket. Likewise, it’s seldom a good idea to put your boss (or your client) on the spot. Don’t demand a love-it-or-hate-it answer. Customers are rarely in a take-it-or-leave-it situation with one option to choose from. They’re accustomed to weighing the pros and cons of multiple offerings and expressing their preferences. Offer as many prototypes as possible within the limits of your budget and schedule. You’ll avoid some awkward conversations. You’ll get more honest, genuine feedback. And you’ll learn from each prototype so that the finished result can be smarter, better, and more successful than the prototypes that got you there. Some readers will doubtless think, “Sure, we’d love to have more prototypes—but we can’t afford a bunch of costly experiments.” And that’s exactly why you have to lower the bar, making prototypes quicker and cheaper than ever before.

14. I’d be the last person to suggest that you completely disregard the experts. But, by nature, experts are often the guardians of conventional wisdom. They have deep knowledge of what has worked in the past, and that knowledge can be extremely valuable. But sometimes a new idea or method, or simply a fresh environment, can make the old views suddenly look outdated.

15. “What IDEO may do best is collaborate.” But there was a time when IDEO might have considered that comment a slight rather than a compliment. When we were primarily a product-design firm, we sometimes saw our role as coming up with the right solutions and handing them over to the client. Today, we more often see ourselves as working alongside a client group, influencing their culture, altering their patterns of innovation, and leaving them with new tools to continue the forward momentum.

16. So how do you pull off an international project? Start with some genuine face time (videoconferencing doesn’t count). Going out for coffee or lunch is how you make the personal connections that build the kind of relationship to enable you to phone someone an ocean away and ask for a favor ASAP. Humans are still hardwired to believe that breaking bread with one another matters.
   - Location: 1870-1872
   - Page: 122

17. When you can’t manage face time, it’s critical to make a space for what some might consider the soft stuff—bio sketches of team members, insights about their hobbies. When you’re working in close proximity, you’re likely to glean this through osmosis, such as when you ask, “What did you do over the weekend?” Leave room to gauge your team’s mood and state of mind. It’s hard to pick up on a team member’s simmering frustration if e-mail is your only form of communication. Street-savvy Collaborators know never to confuse an e-mail with genuine human communication. I’m constantly dumbfounded at how many people send out e-mails when what they really need to do is to make a far more efficient two-minute phone call. That’s maybe the most important suggestion. It’s even more critical in coordinating global innovation efforts. Make time for lots of little and long conversations. Don’t say something in an e-mail that you wouldn’t say in person. Avoid ambiguous e-mails that might possibly be misinterpreted by someone who’s had a bad day. And if possible, never initiate contact through an e-mail.

18. Whole Foods’ financial results are remarkable. In an industry plagued by razor-thin margins, the company earned nearly $200 million in profit over the last two years. Meanwhile, its closest competitor, with seven times the number of stores, couldn’t match Whole Foods’ profits, and others were losing money in a tough market. One of the secrets to Whole Foods’ recipe for success is the collaborative model that permeates their operation. While the big chains have plenty of managers and clerks, Whole Foods generates more creative, engaged, project-oriented teams. Each store has eight in-house teams, and each team does its own hiring. New employees are hired by the bakery team, the seafood team, or whatever group they’re joining. A month after you’re hired, two-thirds of your fellow employees must vote to keep you on. In other words, you’ve got to pull your weight. And like the best project teams everywhere, the Whole Foods functional groups have a lot of say in everything from what they stock in their area to how they display the food. Increased sales and profits for a team translate into extra compensation for members. Adding to the overall team spirit, there’s a sense of equality and transparency in store management that’s rare for any organization. For example, no executive can make more than fourteen times a store’s lowest wage-earner, and every employee can consult a book that lists everyone’s pay. More important, the company has reams of data on sales, volume, and finances that teams regularly consult as they gauge their own success. Everyone is eligible for stock options. There’s even a “Declaration of Interdependence,” which along with laying out the company’s approach to food and its customers clearly articulates how it feels about its employees. Whole Foods claims it has no room for “us-versus-them” thinking. Active, broad participation is its continuous mantra. Some of the ways the company says it achieves those things are worth repeating: Self-directed teams that meet regularly to discuss issues, solve problems, and appreciate each other’s contributions. Increased communication through Team Member Forums and Advisory Groups, and open-book, open-door, and open-people practices. Commitment to make our jobs more fun by combining work and play, and through friendly competition to improve our stores. Continuous-learning opportunities about company values, food, nutrition, and job skills. In other words, teams are the backbone of Whole Foods. And the lifeblood of its operations is collaboration. Chances are if you talk to other Whole Foods regulars, you’ll hear similar stories. Whole Foods workers go out of their way to help customers find products and answer questions about everything from a great fish sauce to how to prepare a certain dish. They’re generally in good spirits and eager to help. This shouldn’t be any surprise. They’re part of a close-knit group. As far as they’re concerned, they’re on a winning team. To me the lesson for Collaborators is simple: Transform the work of your organization into projects headed by teams. Give them a powerful role in their work. My experience tells me you’re bound to reap positive results. Who knows? You just might even pump profit into a traditional business that the pundits gave up on long ago.

19. SEVEN SECRETS TO BRAINSTORMING Here are a few highlights on how to tune up your brainstorms: 1 Sharpen Your Focus Begin with a clear statement of the problem, a question that’s open-ended but not too broad. Focusing on a specific latent customer need or one step of the customer journey can often spark a good ideation session. For example, “How could we gain deeper insights into the experience of our first-time customers?” would be a useful brainstorming topic for many organizations. 2 Mind the Playground Rules We’ve stenciled our brainstorming rules high on the walls of many of our conference rooms: Go for Quantity, Encourage Wild Ideas, Be Visual, Defer Judgment, One Conversation at a Time. Even in a rule-averse culture, we’ve found these basic principles to be both instructive and empowering. 3 Number Your Ideas Numbering your ideas motivates participants, sets a pace, and adds a little structure. A hundred ideas per hour is usually a sign of a good, fluid brainstorm, and even if the group is nearly out of steam when you hit number ninety-four, it’s human nature to want to push on for at least half a dozen more. 4 Jump and Build Even the best brainstorms hit plateaus. You have a flurry of ideas and then they start to get repetitive or peter out. That’s when the facilitator may need to suggest switching gears: “How might we apply these ideas to… ?” Push forward with a small variation or cycle back to a promising earlier idea to maintain momentum and build energy. 5 Remember to Use the Space Leverage the physical environment to make your brainstorm more effective. Let your brainstorm literally take shape and fill the room—write and draw your concepts with markers on giant Post-its stuck to every vertical surface. Capture your ideas in visual, low-tech mediums that everyone can share. Spatial memory is a powerful force you can use to guide the participants back on track. 6 Stretch First Ask attendees to do a little homework on the subject the night before. Play a zippy word game to clear the mind and set aside everyday distractions. Borrowing from the world of improv, we often start with some form of warm-up, like free association, where I toss out a word or idea and another person quickly builds on it and tosses it to someone else. Athletes stretch. So do brainstormers. 7 Get Physical At IDEO, we keep foam core, tubing, duct tape, hot-melt glue guns, and other prototyping basics on hand to sketch, diagram, and make models. Some of our best brainstorms have quickly leaped to roughing out an idea with a crude prototype.

20. Smart companies avoid defining their staff too narrowly when matching people to tasks. Many people boast diverse talents and skills apart from their formal training. It’s important to look for and leverage those complementary gifts where possible. Knowing that someone is a photographer by avocation, for example, might sway us to put them on a project where they could build an image database to help tell the story afterward. Or knowing that someone is an avid cyclist might make us more likely to put them on a wellness-related project team.

21. Before embarking on a continuous-innovation program, it’s crucial to set expectations. How committed will your organization be to the process? Here are seven questions we’ve found that help companies prepare to launch new efforts. Answering them will help ready you for the hard work ahead. How will your company define a successful innovation program? How will your organization fund the innovation process? What corporate resources (staff, space, technology, etc.) will be available to support your effort? How often will the stakeholder groups meet to review your innovation propositions? How many task teams will you sponsor yearly? How often will you put together these teams? How much logistical support will be given to your innovation staff (time away from regular duties, prototyping tools, administrative support, etc.)? What rewards or recognition can people expect for participating in this program? Pay attention to how you answer these questions. If it’s a struggle to answer them, your innovation program may lack the organizational and logistical support it needs. Good Directors give their innovation teams every edge they can. Lobby your firm’s management to gain the financial and corporate backing that can help make your innovation programs a success.

22. Sleep for Success For the past few decades, people in Director roles at IDEO have known that brainstorms hum in the morning, when energy and creativity seem to peak. Only recently has the idea occurred to us that with a good nap in the middle of the day, perhaps you could get two peaks, like having two mornings in the same day. We haven’t done any scientific experiments yet, but it seems worth looking into. Certainly, some of the most prolific and creative people in history have been daytime nappers. Luminaries from Thomas Edison to Winston Churchill have sworn by the rejuvenating powers of a good nap. Churchill began his day with a five-hour morning shift. Smack in the middle came the hearty lunch and ample nap, followed by an evening of work and meetings that often ran till 2 A.M. Albert Einstein said that naps “refreshed the mind” and helped make him more creative. Brahms napped at the piano and da Vinci between brushstrokes. With a good nap in the middle of the day, perhaps you could get twopeaks, like having two mornings in the same day. Today, while the vast majority of corporations consider napping unconventional at best, science has come down firmly on the side of the power nappers. NASA believes in naps, and a number of recent studies have shown that naps can have a tremendous restorative effect. One Harvard study showed that a midday nap reduced “information overload.” Naps appear to improve the brain’s ability to learn a variety of tasks and consolidate memories.

23. Team members see environments and problems in a fresh light. The question becomes how, rather than whether, to change. Directors intuitively understand the importance of making these emotional connections. We’re human, after all. Exploring new ideas isn’t just about making better things and services. It’s about changing people’s behaviors and attitudes. Which may be the most critical step in innovation.

24. Does your group have an innovation Director or two? A catalyst to keep innovation buzzing year-round? It’s everybody’s job in the company to be on the side of innovation, but having a few people wholeheartedly adopt the role of the Director can be worthwhile.

25. Maybe it’s not the hoteliers’ fault. It’s the clock radio people who have thrown in so many superfluous features that the alarms are now impenetrably difficult to figure out the first time you go to set them. And unfortunately, most hotel guests are first-time users of whatever clock radio they encounter in tonight’s room. After about five minutes of wrestling with a user-unfriendly alarm clock, I simply give up trying. (I carry two backups in my suitcase for this worst-case scenario.) Ever wonder why the quaint custom of hotel wake-up calls still exists? It’s not customers clinging to tradition. It’s those darned alarm clocks. Ever wonder why the quaint custom of hotel wake-up calls still exists? It’s not customers clinging to tradition. It’s those darned alarm clocks. Nor am I alone in my frustration and disappointment. The folks at Hampton Inn recently examined more than 150 models in their search for a simple, functional alarm clock for their hotel rooms. When none fit the bill, they took the extraordinary step of designing their own. I consider it a pretty significant failure in the consumer electronics industry that a hotel chain is forced to create its own alarm clock, but that’s exactly what happened. They took out all the useless features (like dual alarms) and made it dirt simple to set correctly. Then they labeled the radio presets with a clear and simple graphic, so you can select rock or jazz or classical even if you don’t know the most popular local stations. What was the result? Not only are customers happier with the simpler models, but they are asking to buy the clock radios for use at home. I don’t know how nice their beds are, but Hampton Inn has certainly hit another trigger point. Give me a reliable alarm clock and I will rest just a little bit easier. Save me from the embarrassment of oversleeping and I will likely return. When it comes to the customer experience, sometimes you gain an edge with just one or two trigger points. Fixing a problem or designing a great experience around those trigger points can be very rewarding.

26. One of the central premises of this chapter is that some of the highest levels of caregiving are inspired by a human touch. But when automated systems have become ubiquitous, how do you maintain that personal connection? What guiding principles might Caregivers keep in mind when it comes to Web-based or other computer-driven services? Interestingly enough, low-tech services may help inform us about what’s critical in a technically charged world. For instance, consider a relatively impersonal style of service most business travelers have experienced—ordering morning coffee at a hotel using the card you hang on your doorknob the night before. You take your pen and check off the options. Check here for decaf… for cream… skim milk… sugar, and so on. Most of the time you get your coffee, but I’d dare say it wasn’t much of an experience. Compare that to Starbucks, where a far wider and richer range of options is laid out before you. Heightening the experience is the invigorating scent of espresso brewing and the sound of beans grinding. The barista is there to help you create your perfect coffee and, of course, offer you a blueberry muffin if you desire. The point is that, unlike checking off the doorknob card, you get the chance to play a more integral role in the process. It’s not purely for operational reasons that they ask for your name at Starbucks. Doing so helps personalize the experience. There’s a value in maintaining human control and interaction—no matter the level of automation. Make sure that the people who use these new services have real, tangible interactions that enable them to fashion an experience or product they can call their own.

27. Just because full automation is possible doesn’t mean it’s necessarily desirable. Mat Hunter, a talented interaction designer who heads our London office, uses a simple expression that says a lot: “Mediate, don’t automate.” “Figuring out what you don’t want the service or machine to do may be the most critical step,” says Hunter. In other words, leave what’s best done by humans to, well, humans. Too often there’s an assumption that the software has to take control and resolve every problem. Better design, says Hunter, is to realize that you can’t automate your way around every crisis—and that, in a high-tech world, sometimes the best services are those that use the wonders of technology to deliver even better traditional person-to-person customer service. This is why no matter how high-tech the best hotels in the world become, there will still be someone at the front desk for you to talk to if you so wish. This is why the real key to improved customer service will be using sophisticated technical information to help smart and well-trained people deliver even better customer service. And why companies that struggle to solve too many problems for their customers—without inviting them to have a hand in the process—may be trying to do too much and offering too little.

28. Stories persuade in a way that facts, reports, and market trends seldom do, because stories make an emotional connection.

29. Storytelling expert Stephen Denning reminds us that not just any story will do. In books like The Leader’s Guide to Storytelling, he helps us match up the right kind of narrative with the right situation. Denning says that business stories have focused purposes like sparking action, transmitting values, fostering collaboration, or leading people into the future. Before you begin a story, it’s important to know what specific outcome you are hoping to attain. For example, when my kids were toddlers, I used to read them a bedtime story most nights with the intent of calming them down and helping them go to sleep, but if you get that outcome in a business setting very often, it’s time to work on your Storyteller role. Regardless of which type of story you’re telling, Denning urges business leaders to be conscious of the distinction between “true” and “authentic.” He says corporations spend too much time speaking at the boundaries of truth, when they should aspire to stay at the heart of authenticity. Truth-in-advertising laws insist that the majority of messages you hear from companies are true—at least in the narrow sense of the word—but authentic is more like “the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” He distinguishes between the two with a quick historical illustration: A true story would be “Titanic sails on maiden voyage. Seven hundred ‘happy’ passengers arrive in New York.” Technically true, yes, but it fails to hold up to any further scrutiny. True stories can have a lot of spin to them. Authentic stories have deep integrity. Customers, employees, and members of the world community can tell the difference. Denning urges business leaders to be conscious of the distinction between “true” and “authentic.” He says corporations spend too much time speaking at the boundaries of truth, when they should aspire to stay at the heart of authenticity.

30. Storytelling builds credibility. We often tell stories about firsthand field research during our initial client meeting. Even though the client may have decades of experience in their industry, the immediacy of our first-person narrative (drawn from recent observations) offers credibility, even if—maybe especially if—it goes against the client’s sense of the market. Passion and a fresh perspective demand respect. The client may know a particular market, but the Storyteller with an intriguing first-person narrative is the world expert on their own experiences.
   - Location: 3602-3607
   - Page: 235

31. 2 Storytelling unleashes powerful emotions and helps teams bond. Captivating stories trigger emotional responses that frequently spark valuable insights. As I mentioned earlier, we’ll often kick off a project by asking clients to tell stories about particularly positive or negative service experiences. We’ve had participants cry when talking about extraordinarily good—and noticeably bad—encounters. By the time everyone’s had a laugh or a nod of recognition, the team is stronger and more focused. You’d be surprised. Even executives fond of a left-brain, analytical approach can get pretty fired up about a story that cuts to the essential human questions.
   - Location: 3607-3613
   - Page: 236

32. 3 Stories give “permission” to explore controversial or uncomfortable topics. Sometimes we invite team members to try a little show-and-tell: to bring in a favorite object and tell us a story about it. One client recently brought in a mountaineer’s ice pick to symbolize his belief in his product’s need for dependability, reliability, and trust. Most likely, he would have been uncomfortable discussing such “touchy-feely” concepts in the abstract, but in the context of a story, it felt very natural to do so. Storytelling can act as a kind of Trojan horse, getting past our initially defensive reactions of doubt or skepticism, enabling us to have an open discussion about a relevant idea.
   - Location: 3613-3619
   - Page: 236

33. 4 Storytelling sways a group’s point of view. We aren’t opposed to studying demographics, industry dynamics, and market trends. But facts alone provide little direction or inspiration for a new project. A compelling story can serve as a parable that helps shape a group’s perspective. Most great leaders have used storytelling as a part of their strategy for success—in ancient times around evening fires, and now using all the modern communication options that are available to them.
   - Location: 3619-3623

34. 7 Good stories help make order out of chaos. We have too many items on our to-do list, too many voice-mail messages, and too many unread e-mails. We cope in part by developing a protective form of attention-deficit disorder that allows us to jump from subject to subject—to screen out, ignore, neglect, or actively forget what would otherwise overwhelm. Good storytelling cuts through the clutter. Think back a few years: Most likely you will have trouble remembering a specific e-mail or phone conversation. But I bet you can remember a good story told to you by your parents long ago, or by your first boss or your best friend. Telling stories is one of the ways you begin building a relationship—whether it’s in life or business.

35. Remember the idea of well-rounded, T-shaped people that is so intrinsic to IDEO’s strategy for hiring and professional development? Maybe for you, your personas can be the bar of your T. If you have spent years building depth of experience in your functional area, then becoming a Collaborator or a Caregiver or an Experimenter might give you breadth. We believe the future belongs to T-shaped people. And it’s not easy to replace a T-shaped person. The broader your talents, the more your ability lies in the overlaps between disciplines, the less likely you will find yourself outsourced. While I believe in all ten of the personas, you don’t need every persona on every project, and certainly not at every moment. A good analogy might be the tools in a carpenter’s toolbox. You seldom need all the tools at once, but the perfect kit of tools is a set where you use all of them pretty frequently.

36. Innovation doesn’t happen on its own, but with the right team, you’re up to the challenge. So find new paths of learning with the Anthropologist, the Experimenter, and the Cross-Pollinator. Organize for innovation with the Hurdler, the Collaborator, and the Director. Ask the Set Designer to help build your stage, and bring on the Experience Architect, the Caregiver, and the Storyteller to wow your audience. Innovation doesn’t just turn companies around. It becomes a way of life. It’s fun. It’s invigorating. It works. With all ten personas on your side, you can drive creativity through the whole organization and build your own unique culture of innovation.

## Quicklet on Richard Dawkins' the Selfish Gene
**Author:** Elspeth Michaels

### Highlights (2)

1. Dawkins asks an interesting question here, “Can we reconcile the idea that copying errors are an essential prerequisite for evolution to occur, with the statement that natural selection favours high copying-fidelity?” (17) While in vague, general terms evolution is seen as a good thing, Dawkins points out that “nothing actually wants to evolve.” (18) Evolution happens despite the efforts of replicators and genes that try to prevent it.

   - Page: 7

2. Dawkins states that we leave two things behind when we die: genes and memes. In many instances, genes and memes reinforce each other, however there are examples of conflict. For example, in some societies, celibacy is a popular meme. Celibacy goes in direct opposition with sex, and thus, gene replication.

4. Creating a workplace culture in which creativity can flourish is never easy and much has been written about how best to do this. Essentially, there are two schools of thought: chaos and process.
   - Location: 153-156
   - Page: 10

5. The chaos theory is one followed by many creative companies: Have very little structure and foster an atmosphere of mild mayhem, an atmosphere in which ideas get thrown around and timetables largely ignored. That is, until panic sets in and results have to be produced. Eventually out of this freewheeling, unencumbered atmosphere, greatness will emerge. Or so you hope. Anyone who has seen the documentary on the making of The Rolling Stones’ album Exile on Main Street will understand what I mean by creative chaos. For many people chaos will be scary. Undisciplined and unpredictable.

6. Whatever you’re creating, simplicity is the ultimate goal. The power of reduction, as we say in advertising, means taking a complex thought and reducing it down to a simple, powerful message.
   - Location: 199-200
   - Page: 13

7. How then to create something that has the power to stay in someone’s mind and capture their imagination? At the foundation of any great idea is the truth, the most powerful force in creativity. Just think of any great work, regardless of medium. It is almost certainly expressing a distinct point of view. But if that point of view doesn’t contain a truth, then you can bet that the work’s impact will be fleeting. And so it is that anyone who wants to create has to find their voice, their truth. At its most basic level, if you don’t believe in what you’re doing, why should anyone else? Finding your own truth and expressing it imaginatively is the skill you must develop, and very often keeping it simple will show you the way. Blaise Pascal, the great French philosopher, summed it up well when writing to a friend. He concluded his letter: ‘My apologies for this letter being so long. Had I more time it would have been shorter.’ So whether you’re writing, painting, acting, directing, or designing, the truth simply expressed is the difference between that piece of work being meaningful or meaningless.

8. No one creates just for the sake of creating. We create to make a point. To express an attitude, a belief. Even if, like me, you work in advertising. The greatest strategy you can employ is the truth. It is handy also, because you can always remember what you’ve said.
   - Location: 222-225

9. Head vs. Heart Stop thinking. Start feeling. Creativity is an intellectual process, but it is also one driven by the heart. Irish writer James Stephens summed it up perfectly when he wrote: What the heart knows today, the head will understand tomorrow. As humans, we respond more to emotions than we do to logic. Anyone who doubts this should try and explain why people go on smoking, despite the warning sign on every pack that reads: SMOKING KILLS
   - Location: 226-237
   - Page: 15

10. When I’m asked, When do you do your best thinking? My answer is always, When I’m not thinking. That’s why a brainstorming session is a complete and utter waste of time for the truly creative person. The idea that, say at ten o’clock on Thursday morning, you can attend a meeting and suddenly be creative is ridiculous. Creativity doesn’t work like that. Too much thinking jeopardizes the creative process, slowing or stopping altogether your imagination and emotions from exploring every possibility out there. And exploration is essential to being creative.

14. The greatest creative people are great precisely because they hold on to a childlike simplicity and urge to question everything. This is sometimes referred to as creative ignorance, not just the rejection of accepted practices but a complete ignorance of them. It’s the creatives who challenge accepted ways of thinking, consciously or unconsciously, that end up making the very best work.
   - Location: 400-403
   - Page: 27

15. The truly great creative people I know are constantly working. Looking, thinking, watching. They are curious by nature, fascinated not just by their own interests and experiences but those of other people too. Everything they encounter is being absorbed, processed, and re-formed, eventually to return in some new shape as an idea. I think of these people as transmitters – they absorb diverse, random messages, influences, and thoughts, then reinterpret and play them back to an audience in new and fresh ways.
   - Location: 408-412

16. Ultimately, if you don’t have a guiding philosophy underpinning your thinking and work then what you produce won’t touch people. It can’t. And that’s the most important task of any piece of creativity.

## Pre-Suasion
**Author:** Robert Cialdini

### Highlights (2)

1. the rise of behavioral economics, an approach to understanding human economic choices that has challenged and, in certain domains, swept away classical economic thinking. Although staking out its own territory, behavioral economics has incorporated aspects of social psychological thinking (for instance, the frequent irrationality of human conduct) and methodology (randomized, controlled experiments). Some of my colleagues feel that behavioral economists have robbed them of credit by claiming various discoveries as their own without acknowledging existing, highly similar social psychological findings. I don’t share the resentment. Although there’s some overlap, it’s not extensive. Moreover, if anything, behavioral economics has raised the public stature of social psychology by adopting some core features and legitimizing them in the minds of decision makers. There was a time, as recently as ten years ago, when social psychologists wouldn’t be invited to international conferences on government or economic policy. Again, those days are gone.

2. All told, there are any of a number of first steps, besides establishing trust, persuaders can take that will make audiences more receptive to the case they intend to present. The steps can take multiple forms, and, accordingly, they’ve been given multiple labels by behavioral scientists. They can be called frames or anchors or primes or mindsets or first impressions. We will encounter each of those types in the remainder of these pages, where, throughout, I’m going to refer to them as openers—because they open up things for influence in two ways. In the first, they simply initiate the process; they provide the starting points, the beginnings of persuasive appeals. But it is in their second function that they clear the way to persuasion, by removing existing barriers.

3. The Grace app gives some nonverbal autistics a chance to “speak” for the first time. It starts with four hundred images that were chosen by nonverbal people as communication starters. Categories include colors, food and drink, my body, and places. Grace allows the users to build their “photo vocabulary” by snapping their own photos to use within the app. The app’s creator, Lisa Domican, named Grace after her autistic daughter. Another app is iConverse, five communication tiles that represent basic needs: food, drink, bathroom break, sick, and help. An AAC (Alternative Augmentative Communication) device can be as simple as making gestures to interact. And you don’t have to be nonverbal to benefit from it. These tools allow a child to express their feelings, thoughts, and needs. He can ask for things at home and school. She can be understood better with less frustration. The goal is to encourage independent social interaction by allowing the child to take control.

## Tribe
**Author:** Sebastian Junger

### Highlights (13)

1. A 2006 study comparing depression rates in Nigeria to depression rates in North America found that across the board, women in rural areas were less likely to get depressed than their urban counterparts. And urban North American women—the most affluent demographic of the study—were the most likely to experience depression. The mechanism seems simple: poor people are forced to share their time and resources more than wealthy people are, and as a result they live in closer communities. Inter-reliant poverty comes with its own stresses—and certainly isn’t the American ideal—but it’s much closer to our evolutionary heritage than affluence. A wealthy person who has never had to rely on help and resources from his community is leading a privileged life that falls way outside more than a million years of human experience. Financial independence can lead to isolation, and isolation can put people at a greatly increased risk of depression and suicide. This might be a fair trade for a generally wealthier society—but a trade it is.

2. In fact, public defenders, who have far lower status than corporate lawyers, seem to lead significantly happier lives. The findings are in keeping with something called self-determination theory, which holds that human beings need three basic things in order to be content: they need to feel competent at what they do; they need to feel authentic in their lives; and they need to feel connected to others. These values are considered “intrinsic” to human happiness and far outweigh “extrinsic” values such as beauty, money, and status.

3. “The economic and marketing forces of modern society have engineered an environment… that maximize[s] consumption at the long-term cost of well-being,” a study in the Journal of Affective Disorders concluded in 2012. “In effect, humans have dragged a body with a long hominid history into an overfed, malnourished, sedentary, sunlight-deficient, sleep-deprived, competitive, inequitable, and socially-isolating environment with dire consequences.”

4. In America during the 1970s, mothers maintained skin-to-skin contact with babies as little as 16 percent of the time, which is a level that traditional societies would probably consider a form of child abuse. Also unthinkable would be the modern practice of making young children sleep by themselves. In two American studies of middle-class families during the 1980s, 85 percent of young children slept alone in their own room—a figure that rose to 95 percent among families considered “well educated.” Northern European societies, including America, are the only ones in history to make very young children sleep alone in such numbers. The isolation is thought to make many children bond intensely with stuffed animals for reassurance. Only in Northern European societies do children go through the well-known developmental stage of bonding with stuffed animals; elsewhere, children get their sense of safety from the adults sleeping near them. The point of making children sleep alone, according to Western psychologists, is to make them “self-soothing,” but that clearly runs contrary to our evolution. Humans are primates—we share 98 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees—and primates almost never leave infants unattended, because they would be extremely vulnerable to predators. Infants seem to know this instinctively, so being left alone in a dark room is terrifying to them.

5. During the 1960s, senior executives in America typically made around twenty dollars for every dollar earned by a rank-and-file worker. Since then, that figure has climbed to 300-to-1 among S&P 500 companies, and in some cases it goes far higher than that. The US Chamber of Commerce managed to block all attempts to force disclosure of corporate pay ratios until 2015, when a weakened version of the rule was finally passed by the SEC in a strict party-line vote of three Democrats in favor and two Republicans opposed. In hunter-gatherer terms, these senior executives are claiming a disproportionate amount of food simply because they have the power to do so. A tribe like the !Kung would not permit that because it would represent a serious threat to group cohesion and survival, but that is not true for a wealthy country like the United States. There have been occasional demonstrations against economic disparity, like the Occupy Wall Street protest camp of 2011, but they were generally peaceful and ineffective.

6. The Blitz, as bad as it was, paled in comparison to what the Allies did. Dresden lost more people in one night than London did during the entire war. Firestorms engulfed whole neighborhoods and used up so much oxygen that people who were untouched by the blasts reportedly died of asphyxiation instead. Fully a third of the German population was subjected to bombardment, and around one million people were killed or wounded.

7. The Iroquois Nation presumably understood the transformative power of war when they developed parallel systems of government that protected civilians from warriors and vice versa. Peacetime leaders, called sachems, were often chosen by women and had complete authority over the civil affairs of the tribe until war broke out. At that point war leaders took over, and their sole concern was the physical survival of the tribe. They were not concerned with justice or harmony or fairness, they were concerned only with defeating the enemy. If the enemy tried to negotiate an end to hostilities, however, it was the sachems, not the war leaders, who made the final decision. If the offer was accepted, the war leaders stepped down so that the sachems could resume leadership of the tribe.

10. wild. A modern soldier returning from combat—or a survivor of Sarajevo—goes from the kind of close-knit group that humans evolved for, back into a society where most people work outside the home, children are educated by strangers, families are isolated from wider communities, and personal gain almost completely eclipses collective good. Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything collectively. Whatever the technological advances of modern society—and they’re nearly miraculous—the individualized lifestyles that those technologies spawn seem to be deeply brutalizing to the human spirit.

11. Iroquois warriors who dominated just about every tribe within 500 miles of their home territory would return to a community that still needed them to hunt and fish and participate in the fabric of everyday life. There was no transition when they came home because—much like in Israel—the battlefield was an extension of society, and vice versa. Recent studies of something called “social resilience” have identified resource sharing and egalitarian wealth distribution as major components of a society’s ability to recover from hardship. And societies that rank high on social resilience—such as kibbutz settlements in Israel—provide soldiers with a significantly stronger buffer against PTSD than low-resilience societies. In fact, social resilience is an even better predictor of trauma recovery than the level of resilience of the person himself.

12. The earliest and most basic definition of community—of tribe—would be the group of people that you would both help feed and help defend. A society that doesn’t offer its members the chance to act selflessly in these ways isn’t a society in any tribal sense of the word; it’s just a political entity that, lacking enemies, will probably fall apart on its own. Soldiers experience this tribal way of thinking at war, but when they come home they realize that the tribe they were actually fighting for wasn’t their country, it was their unit. It makes absolutely no sense to make sacrifices for a group that, itself, isn’t willing to make sacrifices for you. That is the position American soldiers have been in for the past decade and a half.

13. Early hominids lived a precarious existence where freeloaders were a direct threat to survival, and so they developed an exceedingly acute sense of whether they were being taken advantage of by members of their own group. But by the same token, one of the hallmarks of early human society was the emergence of a culture of compassion that cared for the ill, the elderly, the wounded, and the unlucky. In today’s terms, that is a common liberal concern that also has to be taken into account. Those two driving forces have coexisted for hundreds of thousands of years in human society and have been duly codified in this country as a two-party political system.

## Subliminal
**Author:** Leonard Mlodinow

### Highlights (55)

1. HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS the product of an endless stream of perceptions, feelings, and thoughts, at both the conscious and the unconscious levels.

2. The unconscious envisioned by Freud was, in the words of a group of neuroscientists, “hot and wet; it seethed with lust and anger; it was hallucinatory, primitive, and irrational,” while the new unconscious is “kinder and gentler than that and more reality bound.”12 In the new view, mental processes are thought to be unconscious because there are portions of the mind that are inaccessible to consciousness due to the architecture of the brain, rather than because they have been subject to motivational forces like repression. The inaccessibility of the new unconscious is not considered to be a defense mechanism, or unhealthy. It is considered normal.

3. Conscious thought is a great aid in designing a car or deciphering the mathematical laws of nature, but for avoiding snake bites or cars that swerve into your path or people who may mean to harm you, only the speed and efficiency of the unconscious can save you. As we’ll see, to ensure our smooth functioning in both the physical and the social world, nature has dictated that many processes of perception, memory, attention, learning, and judgment are delegated to brain structures outside conscious awareness.

5. Studies show that flowery modifiers not only tempt people to order the lyrically described foods but also lead them to rate those foods as tasting better than the identical foods given only a generic listing.17 If someone were to ask about your taste in fine dining and you were to say, “I lean toward food served with vivid adjectives,” you’d probably get a pretty strange look; yet a dish’s description turns out to be an important factor in how it tastes.

6. The point is that we are not like computers that crunch data in a relatively straightforward manner and calculate results. Instead, our brains are made up of a collection of many modules that work in parallel, with complex interactions, most of which operate outside of our consciousness. As a consequence, the real reasons behind our judgments, feelings, and behavior can surprise us.

7. How about rating one detergent as being superior to another because it comes in a blue-and-yellow box? Or would you buy German wine rather than French because German beer hall music was playing in the background as you walked down the liquor aisle? Would you rate the quality of silk stockings as higher because you liked their scent? In each of these studies, people were strongly influenced by the irrelevant factors—the ones that speak to our unconscious desires and motivations, which traditional economists ignore. Moreover, when quizzed about the reasons for their decisions, the subjects proved completely unaware that those factors had influenced them. For example, in the detergent study, subjects were given three different boxes of detergent and asked to try them all out for a few weeks, then report on which they liked best and why. One box was predominantly yellow, another blue, and the third was blue with splashes of yellow. In their reports, the subjects overwhelmingly favored the detergent in the box with mixed colors. Their comments included much about the relative merits of the detergents, but none mentioned the box. Why should they? A pretty box doesn’t make the detergent work better. But in reality it was just the box that differed—the detergents inside were all identical.20 We judge products by their boxes, books by their covers, and even corporations’ annual reports by their glossy finish. That’s why doctors instinctively “package” themselves in nice shirts and ties and it’s not advisable for attorneys to greet clients in Budweiser T-shirts.

8. In the wine study, four French and four German wines, matched for price and dryness, were placed on the shelves of a supermarket in England. French and German music were played on alternate days from a tape deck on the top shelf of the display. On days when the French music played, 77 percent of the wine purchased was French, while on the days of German music, 73 percent of the wine purchased was German. Clearly, the music was a crucial factor in which type of wine shoppers chose to buy, but when asked whether the music had influenced their choice, only one shopper in seven said it had.21

9. when you run cool wine over your tongue, you don’t just taste its chemical composition; you also taste its price. The same effect has been demonstrated in the Coke-Pepsi wars, only with regard to brand. The effect was long ago dubbed the “Pepsi paradox,” referring to the fact that Pepsi consistently beats Coke in blind taste tests, although people seem to prefer Coke when they know what they are drinking. Over the years, various theories have been proposed to explain this. One obvious explanation is the effect of the brand name, but if you ask people whether it is all those uplifting Coke ads they’ve seen that they are really tasting when they slurp their beverage, they almost always deny it.

10. Both direct, explicit aspects of life (the drink, in this case) and indirect, implicit aspects (the price or brand) conspire to create our mental experience (the taste). They key word here is “create.” Our brains are not simply recording a taste or other experience, they are creating it.

11. According to a textbook on human physiology, the human sensory system sends the brain about eleven million bits of information each second.9 However, anyone who has ever taken care of a few children who are all trying to talk to you at once can testify that your conscious mind cannot process anywhere near that amount. The actual amount of information we can handle has been estimated to be somewhere between sixteen and fifty bits per second. So if your conscious mind were left to process all that incoming information, your brain would freeze like an overtaxed computer. Also, though we don’t realize it, we are making many decisions each second. Should I spit out my mouthful of food because I detect a strange odor? How shall I adjust my muscles so that I remain standing and don’t tip over? What is the meaning of the words that person across the table from me is uttering? And what kind of person is he, anyway?

13. compare two forms of mental activity: vegging out, in which your conscious mind is basically idle, and playing chess. Assuming that you are a good player with an excellent knowledge of all the possible moves and strategies and are concentrating deeply, does all that conscious thought tax your conscious mind to the same degree that running taxed your muscles? No. Not remotely. Deep concentration causes the energy consumption in your brain to go up by only about 1 percent. No matter what you are doing with your conscious mind, it is your unconscious that dominates your mental activity—and therefore uses up most of the energy consumed by the brain. Regardless of whether your conscious mind is idle or engaged, your unconscious mind is hard at work doing the mental equivalent of push-ups, squats, and wind sprints.

14. ONE OF THE most important functions of your unconscious is the processing of data delivered by your eyes. That’s because, whether hunting or gathering, an animal that sees better eats better and avoids danger more effectively, and hence lives longer. As a result, evolution has arranged it so that about a third of your brain is devoted to processing vision: to interpreting color, detecting edges and motion, perceiving depth and distance, deciding the identity of objects, recognizing faces, and many other tasks. Think of it—a third of your brain is busy doing all those things, yet you have little knowledge of or access to the processing. All that hard work proceeds outside your awareness, and then the result is offered to your conscious mind in a neat report, with the data digested and interpreted.

15. What Koch’s group found, however, was that if they present a changing image to one eye and a static one to the other, people will see only the changing image, and never the static one.22 In other words, if your right eye were exposed to a film of two monkeys playing Ping-Pong and your left to a photo of a hundred-dollar bill, you’d be unaware of the static photo even though your left eye had recorded the data and transmitted it to your brain. The technique provides a powerful tool for creating, in a sense, artificial blindsight—a new way to study unconscious vision without destroying any part of the brain. Employing the new technique, another group of scientists performed an experiment on normal people analogous to the one the facial expression researchers performed on patient TN.23 They exposed each subject’s right eye to a colorful and rapidly changing mosaic-like image, and each subject’s left eye to a static photograph that pictured an object. That object was positioned near either the right edge of the photograph or the left, and it was their subjects’ task to guess where the object was, even though they did not consciously perceive the static photo. The researchers expected that, as in the case of TN, the subjects’ unconscious cues would be powerful only if the object pictured was of vital interest to the human brain. This led to an obvious category. And so when the researchers performed this experiment, they selected, for one of the static images, pornography—or, in their scientific jargon, a “highly arousing erotic image.” You can get erotica at almost any newsstand, but where do you get scientifically controlled erotica? It turns out that psychologists have a database for that. It is called the International Affective Picture System, a collection of 480 images ranging from sexually explicit material to mutilated bodies to pleasant images of children and wildlife, each categorized according to the level of arousal it produces. As the researchers expected, when presented with unprovocative static images and asked whether the object was on the left- or the right-hand side of the photo, the subjects’ answers were correct about half the time, which is what you would expect from completely random, uninformed guesses, a rate comparable to TN’s when he was making guesses about circles versus squares. But when heterosexual male subjects were shown an image of a naked woman, they gained a significant ability to discern on which side of the image she was located, as did females who were shown images of naked men. That didn’t happen when men were shown naked men, or when women were shown naked women—with one exception, of course. When the experiment was repeated on homosexual subjects, the results flipped in the manner you might expect. The results mirrored the subjects’ sexual preferences. Despite their successes, when asked afterward what they had seen, all the subjects described just the tedious progression of rapidly changing mosaic images the researchers had presented to their right eye. The subjects were clueless that while their conscious minds were looking at a series of snoozers, their unconscious minds were feasting on Girls (or Boys) Gone Wild.

16. PHILOSOPHERS HAVE FOR centuries debated the nature of “reality,” and whether the world we experience is real or an illusion. But modern neuroscience teaches us that, in a way, all our perceptions must be considered illusions. That’s because we perceive the world only indirectly, by processing and interpreting the raw data of our senses. That’s what our unconscious processing does for us—it creates a model of the world. Or as Kant said, there is Das Ding an sich, a thing as it is, and there is Das Ding für uns, a thing as we know it. For example, when you look around, you have the feeling that you are looking into three-dimensional space. But you don’t directly sense those three dimensions. Instead, your brain reads a flat, two-dimensional array of data from your retinas and creates the sensation of three dimensions.

17. Stand facing your partner, with about four inches separating your noses, then ask your partner to fixate midway between your eyes. Next, have your partner look toward your left ear and back. Repeat this a couple of times. Meanwhile, your job is to observe your partner’s eyes and note that you have no difficulty seeing them move back and forth. The question is, If you could stand nose to nose with yourself and repeat the procedure, would you see your own eyes move? If it is true that your brain edits out visual information received during eye movements, you would not. How can you perform this test? Stand facing a mirror, with your nose two inches from the mirror’s surface (this corresponds to four inches from a real person). Look first right between your eyes, then at your left ear, then back. Repeat a couple of times. Miraculously, you get the two views but never see your eye move between them.

18. The blind spot, saccades, poor peripheral vision—all these issues should cause you severe problems. When you look at your boss, for example, the true retinal image would show a fuzzy, quivering person with a black hole in the middle of his or her face. However emotionally appropriate that may seem, it is not an image you’ll ever perceive, because your brain automatically processes the data, combining the input from both eyes, removing the effects of the jiggling, and filling in gaps on the assumption that the visual properties of neighboring locations are similar.

Even when the entire syllable “gis” in “legislatures” was obliterated by the cough, subjects could not identify the missing sound.26 The effect is called phonemic restoration, and it’s conceptually analogous to the filling in that your brain does when it papers over your retinal blind spot, and enhances the low resolution in your peripheral vision—or

20. IN PHYSICS, SCIENTISTS invent models, or theories, to describe and predict the data we observe about the universe. Newton’s theory of gravity is one example; Einstein’s theory of gravity is another. Those theories, though they describe the same phenomenon, constitute very different versions of reality. Newton, for example, imagined that masses affect each other by exerting a force, while in Einstein’s theory the effects occur through a bending of space and time and there is no concept of gravity as a force. Either theory could be employed to describe, with great accuracy, the falling of an apple, but Newton’s would be much easier to use. On the other hand, for the calculations necessary for the satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) that helps you navigate while driving, Newton’s theory would give the wrong answer, and so Einstein’s must be used. Today we know that actually both theories are wrong, in the sense that both are only approximations of what really happens in nature. But they are also both correct, in that they each provide a very accurate and useful description of nature in the realms in which they do apply. As I said, in a way, every human mind is a scientist, creating a model of the world around us, the everyday world that our brains detect through our senses. Like our theories of gravity, our model of the sensory world is only approximate and is based on concepts invented by our minds. And like our theories of gravity, though our mental models of our surroundings are not perfect, they usually work quite well. The world we perceive is an artificially constructed environment whose character and properties are as much a result of unconscious mental processing as they are a product of real data. Nature helps us overcome gaps in information by supplying a brain that smooths over the imperfections, at an unconscious level, before we are even aware of any perception.

22. Read the following list of words, and please pay careful attention: candy, sour, sugar, bitter, good, taste, tooth, nice, honey, soda, chocolate, heart, cake, eat, and pie. If you read only the first few words carefully and then skimmed the rest because you lack patience and feel silly allowing yourself to be ordered around by a book, please reconsider—it is important. Please read through the list. Study it for half a minute. Now cover the list so you can’t see the words, and keep it covered while you read the next paragraph. If you are a Shereshevsky you’ll have no trouble recalling all the words on the list, but chances are, your memory works a bit differently. In fact, I have given the little exercise I am about to give you to a dozen groups over the years, and the result is always the same. I’ll tell you the punch line after I explain the exercise. It is simple: just identify which of the following three words appeared on the above list: taste, point, sweet. Your answer doesn’t have to be just one word. Perhaps all of them were listed? Or none of them? Please give this some thought. Assess each word carefully. Can you picture seeing it on the list? Are you confident? Don’t choose a word as being on the list unless you are sure of it and can picture it there. Please settle on your answer. Now please uncover the list in the previous paragraph and see how you did.

23. The vast majority of people recall with great confidence that “point” was not on the list. The majority also recall that “taste” was. The punch line of the exercise has to do with the other word: “sweet.” If you recalled seeing that word, it is an illustration of the fact that your memory is based on your recollection of the gist of the list you saw and not the actual list: the word “sweet” was not on the list, but most of the words on the list were related thematically to the concept of sweetness.

24. Dan Simons and his fellow psychologist Daniel Levin created videos depicting simple events in which the actor playing a particular character changed from scene to scene.28 Then they recruited sixty Cornell University students, who agreed to watch the videos in exchange for candy. In a typical video, as depicted by the sample frames below, a person sitting at a desk hears a phone ring, gets up, and walks toward the door. The video then cuts to a view of the hallway, where a different actor walks to the telephone and answers it. The change is not as drastic as, say, replacing Brad Pitt with Meryl Streep. But neither were the two actors hard to tell apart. Would the students notice the switch? Figure provided by Daniel Simons After viewing the film, the students were asked to write a brief description of it. If they didn’t mention the actors’ change, they were asked directly, “Did you notice that the person who was sitting at the desk was a different person than the one who answered the phone?” About two-thirds of them admitted that they hadn’t noticed. Surely during each shot they were aware of the actor and her actions. But they didn’t retain in their memory the details of her identity.

25. They examined whether this phenomenon, called change blindness, also occurred in real-world interactions. This time they took their experiment outdoors, onto the Cornell University campus.29 There, a researcher carrying a campus map approached unsuspecting pedestrians to ask for directions to a nearby building. After the researcher and pedestrian had spoken for ten or fifteen seconds, two other men, each holding one end of a large door, rudely passed between them. As the door passed, it blocked the pedestrian’s view of the experimenter for about one second. During that time, a new researcher with an identical map stepped in to continue the direction-asking interaction while the original researcher walked off behind the door. The substitute researcher was two inches shorter, wore different clothing, and had a noticeably different voice than the original. The pedestrian’s conversational partner had suddenly morphed into someone else. Still, most of the pedestrians didn’t notice, and were quite surprised when told of the switch.

26. In the last chapter we saw how our unconscious takes the incomplete data provided by our senses, fills in what’s missing, and passes the perception to our conscious minds. When we look at a scene we think we are seeing a sharp, well-defined picture, like a photograph, but we really see only a small part of the picture clearly, and our subliminal brains paint in the rest. Our brains use the same trick in memory. If you were designing the system for human memory, you probably would not choose a process that tosses out data wholesale and then, when asked to retrieve it, makes things up. But for the vast majority of us, the method works well, most of the time. Our species would not have survived if that weren’t so. Through evolution, perfection may be abandoned, but sufficiency must be achieved. The lesson that teaches me is to be both humble and grateful. Humble, because any great confidence I feel in any particular memory could well be misplaced; but grateful, both for the memories I retain and the ability to not retain all of them.

27. humans place a high value on kindness. Scientists have even found that parts of our brain linked to reward processing are engaged when we participate in acts of mutual cooperation, so being nice can be its own reward.2 Long before we can verbalize attraction or revulsion, we are attracted to the kind and repelled by the unkind.

28. Eons ago, having a sushi dinner involved skills a bit more advanced than saying, “Pass the wasabi.” It required catching a fish. Before about fifty thousand years ago, humans did not do that; nor did they eat other animals that were available but difficult to catch. Then, rather abruptly (on the evolutionary scale of time), humans changed their behavior.8 According to evidence uncovered in Europe, within the span of just a few millennia people started fishing, catching birds, and hunting down dangerous but tasty and nutritious large animals. At about the same time, they also started building structures for shelter and creating symbolic art and complex burial sites. Suddenly they had both figured out how to gang up on woolly mammoths and begun to participate in the rituals and ceremonies that are the rudiments of what we now call culture. In a brief period of time, the archaeological record of human activity changed more than it had in the previous million years. The sudden manifestation of the modern capacity for culture, ideological complexity, and cooperative social structure—without any change in human anatomy to explain it—is evidence that an important mutation may have occurred within the human brain, a software upgrade, so to speak, that enabled social behavior and thereby bestowed on our species a survival advantage.

29. When we think of humans versus dogs and cats, or even monkeys, we usually assume that what distinguishes us is our IQ. But if human intelligence evolved for social purposes, then it is our social IQ that ought to be the principal quality that differentiates us from other animals. In particular, what seems special about humans is our desire and ability to understand what other people think and feel. Called “theory of mind,” or “ToM,” this ability gives humans a remarkable power to make sense of other people’s past behavior and to predict how their behavior will unfold given their present or future circumstances. Though there is a conscious, reasoned component to ToM, much of our “theorizing” about what others think and feel occurs subliminally, accomplished through the quick and automatic processes of our unconscious mind. For example, if you see a woman racing toward a bus that pulls away before she can get on it, you know without giving it any thought that she was frustrated and possibly ticked off about not reaching the bus in time, and when you see a woman moving her fork toward and away from a piece of chocolate cake, you assume she’s concerned about her weight. Our tendency to automatically infer mental states is so powerful that we apply it not only to other people but to animals and even, as the six-month-olds did in the wooden disk study I described above, to inanimate geometrical shapes.

30. One measure of ToM is called intentionality.13 An organism that is capable of reflecting about its own state of mind, about its own beliefs and desires, as in I want a bite of my mother’s pot roast—is called “first-order intentional.” Most mammals fit in that category. But knowing about yourself is a far different skill from knowing about someone else. A second-order intentional organism is one that can form a belief about someone else’s state of mind, as in I believe my son wants a bite of my pot roast. Second-order intentionality is defined as the most rudimentary level of ToM, and all healthy humans have it, at least after their morning coffee. If you have third-order intentionality you can go a step further, reasoning about what a person thinks a second person thinks, as in I believe my mom thinks that my son wants a bite of her pot roast. And if you are capable of going a level beyond that, of thinking I believe my friend Sanford thinks that my daughter Olivia thinks that his son Johnny thinks she is cute or I believe my boss, Ruth, knows that our CFO, Richard, thinks that my colleague John doesn’t believe her budgets and revenue projections can be trusted, then you’re engaging in fourth-order intentionality, and so on. Fourth-order thinking makes for a pretty complicated sentence, but if you ponder these for a minute, you’ll probably realize you engage in it quite frequently, for it is typical of what is involved in human social relationships.

31. The evidence on nonhuman primates seems to show that they fall somewhere between first- and second-order thinking. A chimp may think to itself, I want a banana or even I believe George wants my banana, but it wouldn’t go as far as thinking, I believe George thinks that I want his banana. Humans, on the other hand, commonly engage in third- and fourth-order intentionality and are said to be capable of sixth-order.

32. The genus Homo, of which humans, Homo sapiens, are the only surviving species, first evolved about two million years ago. Anatomically, Homo sapiens reached its present form about two hundred thousand years ago, but as I’ve said, behaviorally, we humans did not take on our present characteristics, such as culture, until about fifty thousand years ago. In the time between the original Homo species and ourselves, the brain doubled in size.

33. And so the new field of social cognitive neuroscience, or, simply, social neuroscience, emerged. It is a ménage à trois, a “household of three”: social psychology, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. I said earlier that the first ever social neuroscience meeting took place in April 2001. To get an idea of how fast the field exploded, consider this: The first ever academic publication employing fMRI came in 1991.41 In 1992, there were only four such publications in the entire year. Even as late as 2001, an Internet search using the words “social cognitive neuroscience” yielded just 53 hits. But an identical search performed in 2007 yielded more than 30,000.42 By then, neuroscientists were turning out fMRI studies every three hours.

34. As anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of a fellow driver’s display of the middle finger knows, nonverbal communication is sometimes quite obvious and conscious. But then there are those times when a significant other says, “Don’t look at me like that,” and you respond, “Don’t look at you like what?,” knowing full well the nature of the feelings you were so sure you had hidden. Or you might smack your lips and proclaim that your spouse’s scallop-and-cheddar casserole is yummy but somehow still elicit the response “What, you don’t like it?” Don’t fret; if a horse can read you, why not your spouse?

35. Nonverbal communication forms a social language that is in many ways richer and more fundamental than our words. Our nonverbal sensors are so powerful that just the movements associated with body language—that is, minus the actual bodies—are enough to engender within us the ability to accurately perceive emotion. For example, researchers made video clips of participants who had about a dozen small lights or illuminated patches attached at certain key positions on their bodies, as in the picture here.36 The videos were shot in light so dim that only the patches were visible. In these studies, when the participants stood still, the patches gave the impression of a meaningless collection of points. But when the participants stirred, observers were able to decode a surprising amount of information from the moving lights. They were able to judge the participants’ sex, and even the identity of people with whom they were familiar, from their gait alone. And when the participants were actors, mimes, or dancers asked to move in a way that expressed the basic emotions, the observers had no trouble detecting the emotion portrayed. Courtesy of A. P.

36. Remember Shereshevsky, the man with the flawless memory who had great trouble recognizing faces? In his memory, each person had many faces: faces as viewed from different angles, faces in varying lighting, faces for each emotion and for each nuance of emotional intensity. As a result, the encyclopedia of faces on the bookshelf of Shereshevsky’s brain was exceptionally thick and difficult to search, and the process of identifying a new face by matching it to one previously seen—which is the essence of what categorization is—was correspondingly cumbersome. Every object and person we encounter in the world is unique, but we wouldn’t function very well if we perceived them that way. We don’t have the time or the mental bandwidth to observe and consider each detail of every item in our environment. Instead, we employ a few salient traits that we do observe to assign the object to a category, and then we base our assessment of the object on the category rather than the object itself. By maintaining a set of categories, we thus expedite our reactions.

37. it is easy to underestimate the complexity of what is involved in categorization because we usually do it quickly and without conscious effort. When we think of food types, for example, we automatically consider an apple and a banana to be in the same category—fruit—though they appear quite different, but we consider an apple and a red billiard ball to be in different categories, even though they appear quite similar. An alley cat and a dachshund might both be brown and of roughly similar size and shape, while an Old English sheepdog is far different—large, white, and shaggy—but even a child knows that the alley cat is in the category feline and the dachshund and sheepdog are canines.

38. when we categorize, we polarize. Things that for one arbitrary reason or another are identified as belonging to the same category seem more similar to each other than they really are, while those in different categories seem more different than they really are. The unconscious mind transforms fuzzy differences and subtle nuances into clear-cut distinctions. Its goal is to erase irrelevant detail while maintaining information on what is important.

39. The moral of the story is that if we wish to overcome unconscious bias, it requires effort. A good way to start is by taking a closer look at those we are judging, even if they are not on trial for murder but, instead, are simply asking for a job or a loan—or our vote. Our personal knowledge of a specific member of a category can easily override our category bias, but more important, over time repeated contact with category members can act as an antidote to the negative traits society assigns to people in that category.

42. Emotions, in today’s neo-Jamesian view, are like perceptions and memories—they are reconstructed from the data at hand. Much of that data comes from your unconscious mind, as it processes environmental stimuli picked up by your senses and creates a physiological response. The brain also employs other data, such as your preexisting beliefs and expectations, and information about the current circumstances. All of that information is processed, and a conscious feeling of emotion is produced.

43. If emotions are constructed from limited data rather than direct perception, similar to the way vision and memory are constructed, then, as with perception and memory, there must be circumstances when the way the mind fills in the gaps in the data results in your “getting it wrong.” The result would be “emotional illusions” that are analogous to optical and memory illusions.

44. THE EXAMPLES I’VE talked about so far imply that we often don’t understand our feelings. Despite that, we usually think that we do. Moreover, when asked to explain why we feel a certain way, most of us, after giving it some thought, have no trouble supplying reasons. Where do we find those reasons, for feelings that may not even be what we think they are? We make them up.

45. Teachers aren’t any more realistic: 94 percent of college professors say they do above-average work.4 Psychologists call this tendency for inflated self-assessment the “above-average effect,” and they’ve documented it in contexts ranging from driving ability to managerial skills.5 In engineering, when professionals were asked to rate their performance, between 30 percent and 40 percent put themselves in the top 5 percent.6 In the military, officers’ assessments of their leadership qualities (charisma, intellect, and so on) are far rosier than assessments of them made by their subordinates and superiors.7 In medicine, doctors’ assessments of their interpersonal skill are far higher than the ratings they received from their patients and supervisors, and their estimates of their own knowledge are far higher than objective tests bear out.8 In one study, in fact, physicians who diagnosed their patients as having pneumonia reported an average of 88 percent confidence in that diagnosis but proved correct only 20 percent of the time.9 This kind of inflation is equally the rule in the corporate world. Most business executives think their company is more likely to succeed than the typical company in their business, because it’s theirs,10 and CEOs display overconfidence when entering into new markets or embarking on risky projects.11 One result of this is that when companies acquire other firms, they typically pay 41 percent more for the target firm’s stock than its current price, feeling they can run it more profitably, while the combined value of the merging firms usually falls, indicating that impartial observers feel otherwise.

46. Ironically, people tend to recognize that inflated self-assessment and overconfidence can be a problem—but only in others.14 That’s right, we even overestimate our ability to resist overestimating our abilities. What’s going on?

47. As the psychologist Jonathan Haidt put it, there are two ways to get at the truth: the way of the scientist and the way of the lawyer. Scientists gather evidence, look for regularities, form theories explaining their observations, and test them. Attorneys begin with a conclusion they want to convince others of and then seek evidence that supports it, while also attempting to discredit evidence that doesn’t. The human mind is designed to be both a scientist and an attorney, both a conscious seeker of objective truth and an unconscious, impassioned advocate for what we want to believe. Together these approaches vie to create our worldview.

49. Visual perception, memory, and even emotion are all constructs, made of a mix of raw, incomplete, and sometimes conflicting data. We use the same kind of creative process to generate our self-image. When we paint our picture of self, our attorney-like unconscious blends fact and illusion, exaggerating our strengths, minimizing our weaknesses, creating a virtually Picassoesque series of distortions in which some parts have been blown up to enormous size (the parts we like) and others shrunk to near invisibility. The rational scientists of our conscious minds then innocently admire the self-portrait, believing it to be a work of photographic accuracy. Psychologists call the approach taken by our inner advocate “motivated reasoning.” Motivated reasoning helps us to believe in our own goodness and competence, to feel in control, and to generally see ourselves in an overly positive light. It also shapes the way we understand and interpret our environment, especially our social environment, and it helps us justify our preferred beliefs.

The Catholic says, “I was a good man all my life, but I suffered a lot of discrimination. What do I have to do to get into heaven?” “That’s easy,” says God. “All you have to do to enter heaven is spell one word.” “What’s that?” the Catholic asks. “God,” answers the Lord. The Catholic spells it out, G-O-D, and is let in. Then the Jew approaches. He, too, says, “I was a good man.” And then he adds, “And it wasn’t easy—I had to deal with discrimination all my life. What do I have to do to get into heaven?” God says, “That’s easy. All you have to do is spell one word.” “What’s that?” the Jew asks. “God,” answers the Lord. The Jew says, “G-O-D,” and he, too, is let in. Then the black man approaches and says that he was kind to everyone, although he faced nasty discrimination because of the color of his skin. God says, “Don’t worry, there is no discrimination here.” “Thank you,” says the black man. “So how do I get into heaven?” “That’s easy,” says God. “All you have to do is spell one word!” “What’s that?” the black man asks. “Czechoslovakia,” answers the Lord.

52. In one study, participants considered applications from a male and a female candidate for the job of police chief. That’s a stereotypically male position, so the researchers postulated that the participants would favor the male applicant and then unwittingly narrow the criteria by which they judged the applicants to those that would support that decision. Here is how the study worked: There were two types of résumés. The experimenters designed one to portray a streetwise individual who was poorly educated and lacking in administrative skills. They designed the other to reflect a well-educated and politically connected sophisticate who had little street smarts. Some participants were given a pair of résumés in which the male applicant had the streetwise résumé and the female was the sophisticate. Others were given a pair of résumés in which the man’s and the woman’s strong points were reversed. The participants were asked not just to make a choice but to explain it. The results showed that when the male applicant had the streetwise résumé, the participants decided street smarts were important for the job and selected him, but when the male applicant had the sophisticate’s résumé, they decided that street smarts were overrated and also chose the male. They were clearly making their decisions on the basis of gender, and not on the streetwise-versus-sophisticated distinction, but they were just as clearly unaware of doing so. In fact, when asked, none of the subjects mentioned gender as having influenced them.40

53. The artist Salvador Dalí once said, “Every morning upon awakening, I experience a supreme pleasure: that of being Salvador Dalí, and I ask myself, wonderstruck, what prodigious thing will he do today, this Salvador Dalí?”46 Dalí may have been a sweet guy or he may have been an insufferable egomaniac, but there is something wonderful about his unrestrained and unabashedly optimistic vision of his future. The psychological literature is full of studies illustrating the benefits—both personal and social—of holding positive “illusions” about ourselves.47 Researchers find that when they induce a positive mood, by whatever means, people are more likely to interact with others and more likely to help others. Those feeling good about themselves are more cooperative in bargaining situations and more likely to find a constructive solution to their conflicts. They are also better problem solvers, more motivated to succeed, and more likely to persist in the face of a challenge. Motivated reasoning enables our minds to defend us against unhappiness, and in the process it gives us the strength to overcome the many obstacles in life that might otherwise overwhelm us. The more of it we do, the better off we tend to be, for it seems to inspire us to strive to become what we think we are. In fact, studies show that the people with the most accurate self-perceptions tend to be moderately depressed, suffer from low self-esteem, or both.48 An overly positive self-evaluation, on the other hand, is normal and healthy.49

## The Geography of Genius: A Search for the World's Most Creative Places from Ancient Athens to Silicon Valley
**Author:** Eric Weiner

### Highlights (41)

1. My favorite definition of creative genius comes from researcher and artificial-intelligence expert Margaret Boden. The creative genius, she says, is someone with “the ability to come up with ideas that are new, surprising, and valuable.” Those also are the criteria the US Patent Office uses when deciding whether an invention deserves a patent. Consider something as simple as a coffee cup. I might invent one that is painted an unusual shade of fluorescent orange. Yes, it is new, but not especially surprising or all that useful. Now let’s say I invent a coffee cup with no bottom. That is certainly new, and definitely surprising, but, again, not particularly useful. No, to qualify for a patent, I would have to invent, say, a self-cleaning coffee cup or a folding one that doubles as a flash drive—something that fulfilled all three criteria: new, surprising, and useful. The toddler steps of incremental innovation don’t earn you a patent, or the title of genius. Only a leap does.

2. I’ve selected six historic places of genius, as well as one current one. Some are huge metropolises, such as Vienna of 1900; others, such as Renaissance Florence, are tiny by modern standards. Some, such as ancient Athens, are well-known; others such as nineteenth-century Calcutta, less so. Each of these places, though, represented an apex of human achievement. Nearly all are cities. We may be inspired by nature—a walk in the woods, the sound of a waterfall—but something about an urban setting is especially conducive to creativity. If it takes a village to raise a child, as the African proverb goes, it takes a city to raise a genius.

3. “Creativity cannot be separated from its recognition,” says psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the main advocate of this theory. Put more bluntly, someone is only a genius if we say so.

4. Recently, researchers have begun to investigate scientifically the link between walking and creativity. In a recent study, Stanford University psychologists Marily Oppezzo and Daniel Schwartz divided participants into two groups: walkers and sitters. They then administered something called Guilford’s Alternative Uses test, in which participants come up with alternative uses for everyday objects. It’s designed to measure “divergent thinking,” an important component of creativity. Divergent thinking is when we come up with multiple, unexpected solutions to problems. Divergent thinking is spontaneous and free-flowing. Convergent thinking, by contrast, is more linear and entails a narrowing, rather than an expanding, of your options. Convergent thinkers are trying to find the one correct answer to a question. Divergent thinkers reframe the question. The results, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, confirm that the ancient Greeks were onto something. Creativity levels were “consistently and significantly” higher for the walkers versus the sitters. Curiously, it didn’t matter whether participants walked outdoors in the fresh air or indoors on a treadmill staring at a blank wall. They still produced twice as many creative responses compared with the sedentary group. It didn’t take a lot of walking to boost creativity, either—anywhere from five to sixteen minutes.

5. Disorder is embedded in the Greek creation myth, where in the beginning there was not light but chaos. That wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. For the Greeks—and, as I’d later learn, Hindus, too—chaos is the raw material of creativity.

6. In a landmark study, Teresa Amabile, a psychologist at Harvard University, examined what effect a promised reward has on creative thinking. She divided a team of volunteers into two groups. Each group was asked to produce a collage. One group, though, was told that their work would be evaluated by a panel of artists and that those who produced the most creative collages would receive a monetary award. The second group was told, essentially, to have fun. The results weren’t even close. By a wide margin, those who were neither evaluated nor observed produced the most creative collages (as determined by a panel of art teachers). In many follow-up studies, Amabile and her colleagues found similar results. The expectation of a reward or evaluation, even a positive evaluation, squelched creativity. She calls this phenomenon the intrinsic theory of motivation. Stated simply: “People will be most creative when they feel motivated primarily by interest, enjoyment, satisfaction, and the challenge of the work itself—not by external pressures.” She warns that many schools and corporations, by placing such emphasis on rewards and evaluation, are inadvertently suppressing creativity.

7. Some recent studies cast doubt on the intrinsic theory of motivation. Jacob Eisenberg, a professor of business at University College Dublin, and William Thompson, a psychologist at Macquarie University, found that experienced musicians improvised more creatively when enticed with cash prizes and publicity. These results appear to fly in the face of the intrinsic theory of motivation. Is the theory flawed or the study? Neither, actually. What matters, Eisenberg and Thompson suspect, is the type of people involved in the studies. Amabile’s participants tended to be novices, with no background in art, while Eisenberg’s were veteran musicians, with at least five years’ experience. Competition apparently motivates experienced creators but inhibits inexperienced ones. An evolving theory suggests that some combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is ideal. Some, for instance, might initially be motivated by the promise of an external reward (money, status, etc.), but once immersed in the work they enter a psychological state known as flow. They forget about any external pressure and even lose track of time.

8. Civic life, though, was not optional, and Aristotle tells me the Athenians had a word for those who refused to participate in public affairs: idiotes. It is where we get our word idiot. There was no such thing as an aloof, apathetic Athenian, at least not for long. “The man who took no interest in the affairs of state was not a man who minded his own business, but a man who had no business being in Athens at all,” said the great historian Thucydides.

9. It’s the intellectual equivalent of anosognosia, and this phenomenon, now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, explains a lot. It explains why most people consider themselves above-average drivers, a statistical impossibility. (Somebody has to be below average.)

10. The first step in any breakthrough is realizing that a breakthrough is necessary, realizing that your knowledge is imperfect. Those who possess this “thoroughly conscious ignorance,” as the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell put it, are more likely to achieve creative breakthroughs than those who are convinced they have it all figured out.

11. On an individual level, psychologists have identified this “openness to experience” as the single most important trait of exceptionally creative people. The same holds true for societies, as Dean Simonton’s research shows. He examined a country that has, historically, been among the world’s most closed societies: Japan. Looking at a long stretch of time, from 580 until 1939, Simonton compared Japan’s “extra cultural influx” (travel abroad, immigration, etc.) and its national achievements in such fields as medicine, philosophy, painting, and literature. He found a consistent correlation: the greater Japan’s openness, the greater its achievements, especially in the arts.

12. disproportionately large number of geniuses, of any era, lost a parent, usually a father, at a young age. A study of some seven hundred historical figures by psychologist J. M. Eisenstadt found that 35 percent lost a parent by age fifteen and nearly half, 45 percent, by age twenty. The list includes Dante, Bach, Darwin, Michelangelo, Dostoyevsky, Mark Twain, and Virginia Woolf. These geniuses possessed not only an ability to rebound from suffering but to transform that suffering into productive, and creative, outlets.

13. Shen possessed many talents but, ultimately, I think his was the genius of observation. Not any kind of observation, mind you, but the kind that leads to instantaneous insight—what author Robert Grudin calls “the beauty of sudden seeing.” His was the kind of observation Charles Darwin had in mind when he warned, “It is a fatal fault to reason whilst observing.” Darwin advocated observation unencumbered by assumptions and expectations. See what is before you, the thing itself. Analyze later. Every great discovery, every world-changing invention, every bold theorem, began with this simple act of observation. The genius looks at what everyone else is looking at and sees something different. The world sees another Viennese housewife suffering from hysteria; Freud sees the inklings of something more profound. The world sees two unrelated species of finches; Darwin sees a connection, and a possible explanation for how humans progressed. The grand theories—of the unconscious and of evolution, respectively—would come later, but already their seeds had been planted through simple observation. Only, of course, it is not so simple. We acclimate to our environment so we no longer see it. Creative people are able to avoid this deadening of perception and “make the familiar strange.”

15. Marjorie Shostak interviewed members of the Kalahari Desert’s !Kung San tribe, known for their bead weaving, storytelling, and music. When asked who were the most creative members of their tribe, they invariably replied, “Everyone.” In primitive societies, most people participate in creative activities. In more “advanced” ones, creativity becomes something special and therefore an option for fewer and fewer people.

16. Asian cultures—especially Confucian ones such as China and Korea—approach creativity very differently from Western ones. Westerners tend to be concerned solely with the outcome of creativity. The product, as it were. Asians care about process, the journey as much as the destination. Also, Western cultures equate creativity with novelty; for us to consider something, anything, creative it must represent a radical break from tradition. Not so in Confucian countries such as China. The Chinese are less concerned with the novelty of an invention or idea and much more concerned with its utility. Not “Is this innovation new and surprising?” but “Is it useful?” In China, creativity represents not a break from tradition but a continuation of it, a circling back. Why such different approaches? Our notions of creativity and genius are deeply rooted in our creation myths. These myths are extremely powerful. Even if you’re not the least bit religious, chances are you have internalized them. “In the beginning God created heaven and earth.” The impact of those words, on the religious and the secular alike, is enormous. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is possible—indeed admirable—to create something ex nihilo, from nothing. That is what God did in creating the world, and that is what we humans aim to do, too. In this worldview, the artist (or architect or software engineer) creates something out of the blue, something that did not exist before. The creative act, like time itself, is linear. The creator starts at X and advances—in fits and starts, with plenty of coffee breaks—until he or she reaches Y. In Chinese cosmology, though, the universe, the Tao, has no beginning nor is there a creator. There has always been something and always will be. The creative act, therefore, is not one of invention but of discovery. The Chinese way is creatio in situ. Creation in context.

19. The problem with much of what passes for “creativity training” in corporate retreats these days is that it starts with the assumption that creativity is a free-floating skill that can be taught on its own. It cannot, any more than athletics can be taught. You can teach someone tennis. You can teach them basketball. You cannot teach them athletics.

20. Normally we think of creativity strictly in terms of problem solving. We are presented with a difficult puzzle, then we deploy our “creative skills” to solve the assigned problem. That is admirable, but what if we don’t know what the problem is we’re trying to solve? Enter “problem finding.” Problem solvers answer questions. Problem finders discover new questions, and then answer them. It is these new questions, even more than the answers, that distinguish the genius. Which is why Picasso once quipped, “Computers are stupid. They only give you answers.”

21. Hume was a rationalist, but not in the cold, robotic sense of the word. “Indulge your passion for science but let your science be human,” he urged. “Reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions.” With those few words, he upturned centuries of philosophical thought. Most philosophers, dating back to Aristotle, argued that what distinguished man from other animals was his ability to reason, but “Hume quietly pointed out that human beings are not, and never have been, governed by their rational capacities,” writes Herman, the historian. Reason, Hume argued, doesn’t determine what we want but only how we obtain it.

22. another trait common to geniuses: an utter and complete lack of self-consciousness. Hutton simply didn’t care what others thought of him. Few geniuses do. Think of Socrates’s nose. Or Einstein’s hair. That is not the hair of someone who devoted much of his considerable gray matter to personal grooming. And who can blame him? He didn’t want to pay the opportunity cost. Time spent combing your hair is time not spent contemplating the speed of light.

23. the Zeigarnik effect. Bluma Zeigarnik was a Russian psychologist. She was at a restaurant one day and noticed how the waiters kept perfect track of orders, but as soon as the plates hit the table, they “deleted” the information. She conducted a series of experiments and determined that we recall information associated with incomplete tasks much more readily than other types of information. Something about an unsolved problem boosts our memory and sharpens our thinking.

24. Places of genius are not only densely populated, they are also intimate, and intimacy always includes a degree of trust. The Greek philosophers and poets gathered at a symposium trusted one another, so a degree of intimacy was established. Verrocchio trusted his craftsmen to complete their assigned tasks. Today, the cities and companies that excel creatively are those where trust and intimacy are high.

25. Smart people plus conversation do not necessarily add up to genius. It certainly wasn’t what emerged from the oven after President John F. Kennedy held a series of closed-door meetings with his closest, and smartest, advisers. No, the result was the ill-conceived 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Nearly all of the fourteen hundred CIA-trained Cuban exiles were captured or killed. Cuba moved even deeper into the Soviet orbit. It was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in American history. How could it have happened, given the combined intellectual throw weight gathered in that room? A decade later, a psychologist named Irving Janis investigated the meetings that led to the botched invasion and concluded that the profound error in judgment was due not to stupidity, but rather to a quirk of human nature. When people from similar backgrounds get together, are isolated from dissenting views, and are trying to please a strong leader, the result is consensus around the preferred position, even if it is clearly wrongheaded. Janis coined a term for this tendency: groupthink. Groupthink is the flip side of group genius. It is the bugaboo in every theory that celebrates the virtues of collective intelligence. Groupthink is collective stupidity, and every culture is susceptible to it. The question is, why does it rear its head at certain times and not others? Why is it that when you get one group of smart people together the result is genius, and with another group of equally smart people the result is groupthink? That question has no simple answer, but psychologists suspect a lot hinges on a group’s willingness to entertain dissenting views. Groups that tolerate dissent generate more ideas, and more good ideas, than groups that don’t, studies have found. This holds true even if those dissenting views turn out to be completely wrong. The mere presence of dissent—even if wrongheaded—improves creative performance. How we talk matters at least as much as what we’re talking about. Conflict isn’t only acceptable in a place of genius. It is indispensable.

26. blind variation and selective retention. It’s a theory of creativity that Simonton has been developing for the past twenty-five years, and it speaks directly to the geniuses of Edinburgh. Creative genius, Simonton believes, involves “superfluidity and backtracking.” Superfluidity is the willingness to pursue hunches that might well turn out to be dead ends. Backtracking is when you return to these supposed dead ends and give them a second look. Geniuses, as we’ve seen, don’t have a higher batting average than the rest of us; if anything, they miss more often, but—and this is key—they are able to recall exactly where they missed and why. Psychologists call these markers “failure indices.”

27. Complicated things can be explained by examining their individual parts. Complex ones cannot. They are always greater than the sum of their parts. This dynamic has nothing to do with the number of parts or, say, the cost of the object. A jet engine is complicated. Mayonnaise is complex.

28. Complex systems are more likely to produce what scientists call an emergent phenomenon. A simple example of emergence is wetness. What does it mean, from a molecular point of view, to say that something is wet? You can examine individual molecules of water yet not detect anything resembling wetness. Only when enough molecules coalesce does the quality we call wetness emerge. An emergent phenomenon represents a new kind of order created from an old system.

29. As we saw in China, creativity is inextricably tied to a culture’s ancient creation myths. The West’s notion of creation ex nihilo, “from nothing,” is only one way of thinking about creativity. There is also an Indian way, and I suspect this, too, explains the creative flourishing.
   - Location: 3305-3307

30. The Hindu cosmology in some ways resembles the Chinese one. As you recall, the Chinese adhere to a cyclical conception of time and history. There is nothing to invent, only old truths to rediscover and combine in imaginative ways. “Since man cannot create out of nothing, he can only bring existing materials into new relationships,” says Hallman, noting how this contrasts with the Western view, with its emphasis on novelty. So ingrained is our fixation on novelty that we can hardly imagine a concept of creativity where it doesn’t feature prominently. If the creative person isn’t actually creating something new, what is she doing? The answer, says Hallman, lies in “substituting intensity for originality.” For Hindus, the genius is like a lightbulb illuminating a room. The room has always been there and always will. The genius does not create or even discover the room. She illuminates it. This is not insignificant. Without that illumination, we remain ignorant of the room’s existence, and of the wonders that lie inside. Different faiths emphasize different senses as pathways to the divine. For Hindus, it is vision. When a Hindu goes to a temple, he doesn’t go to “worship” but for darsan, to see the image of a deity. Seeing isn’t part of worship, it is worship. Seeing, when done properly, is an act not only of devotion but of creation. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, Yahweh speaks and the world is created. In Hindu cosmology, Brahma sees that the world is already there. Likewise, the creative person sees what others do not. “He has a capacity for noting things, for allowing them to fill his full field of vision,” says Hallman. It is vision as a form of knowledge.

31. Mozart wanted to reach a broad audience, yet not everyone has the same “musical intelligence.” What to do? Dumbing down his music was not an option; he was too much the virtuoso for that. So Mozart happened upon a solution that was way ahead of his time. He constructed his symphonies the way Pixar constructs movies: designed to appeal to two distinct audiences at the same time. In the case of Pixar, those audiences are children and their parents. Much of the humor soars over the kids’ heads, but the parents get it and appreciate it. Mozart also had two distinct target audiences. He explains his approach in a letter to his father, dated December 28, 1782: “There are passages here and there from which connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction, but these passages are written in such a way that the less learned cannot fail to be pleased, though without knowing why.” Perhaps all works of genius—from The Magic Flute to The Incredibles—are like that. They operate on several levels simultaneously. Like the Parthenon, their linear appearance is an illusion; all great works contain hidden curves. It’s been said that originality is the art of concealing your sources.

32. “An ecology of human creativity,” psychologist David Harrington calls it. What does this mean? For starters, it means viewing genius from a more holistic perspective, realizing that all the parts are connected. Biologists studying ecosystems know that it’s impossible to tinker with one part of that system without fundamentally altering the whole. Creatologists, Harrington argues, need to think about creative genius in the same way. For instance, take the concept of “selective migration.” That’s when organisms flock to a certain environment not because they have been displaced by some natural disaster, or because their inner GPS dictates such a move, but because they have identified that environment as beneficial. They know they will thrive there. This is precisely what Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn did. They moved to Vienna because the habitat met their particular needs and they knew they’d flourish there. Another term that Harrington borrows from biology is biochemical demand. We know that organisms place certain demands on the ecosystems that they inhabit. Plants, for instance, consume sunlight and water. If the ecosystem can meet those demands, then the organisms will survive; if not, they will perish. It’s that simple. Likewise, Harrington argues, creative people place certain “psychosocial demands” on their ecosystem—“demands that must be met if the creative processes are to flourish.” These demands include time, workspace, communication channels, and access to audiences. Harrington, again borrowing from biology, emphasizes the importance of “organism-environment fit.” Ultimately, whether an organism survives depends not on the organism itself but on its relationship with its environment. Likewise, creative people must be a good “fit” with their environment if they are to realize their potential. For instance, some people thrive in an environment that encourages risk taking while others do not. A “good” cultural fit, though, isn’t necessarily a frictionless one. Socrates is the best, and most tragic, example of this. Finally, as any biologist knows, environments don’t only shape organisms, they are shaped by them. These organisms deplete resources, yes, but also give something back. Plants suck up carbon dioxide but also emit much-needed oxygen into the atmosphere. Similarly, creative geniuses drain the cultural resources of a city—money, space, time—but deliver something in return. One look at the Parthenon or the Duomo tells you that.

34. Several studies have found that we are more creative when surrounded by creative coworkers, even if we don’t interact directly with these colleagues. And recall that we get a creativity boost from merely watching “schema violations” (someone eating pancakes for dinner, for instance). Something about being in the presence of creativity inspires us to think more creatively ourselves.

35. One of the biggest myths about Silicon Valley, says Chuck, is that people here take risks. It is a myth that is simultaneously true and untrue, a Janusian construction that would tickle a Scot. Chuck says Silicon Valley celebrates risk, yet at the same time “it has some of the best mechanisms for avoiding the consequences of risk in the world.” “Such as?” “Just think about it. These entrepreneurs, we’re told, deserve their money because of the risk they take. But you don’t see people jumping off the tops of buildings here. They tend to land on their feet. They tend to land in places like this, drinking cappuccinos, because the risk is a peculiar kind of risk. Most of the people in high tech will admit if they lost their job, they would find another one. They might even find a better one.” “So they’re working with a net?” “Yes. A huge net. It’s easier to take risk when you are insulated from it.”

36. In 1973, a young sociologist named Mark Granovetter wrote an academic paper that, over the years, has become the most cited paper in all of sociology (29,672 citations at last count). It’s called “The Strength of Weak Ties.” A short paper, a “fragment of a theory,” he called it at the time, it is nonetheless fascinating for both its simplicity and its intriguing, counterintuitive thesis. The title says it all. What we think of as weak ties—acquaintances, coworkers, etc.—are actually incredibly powerful. Likewise, what we think of as strong ties—close friends, family—are actually weak. In his paper, Granovetter concedes this doesn’t appear to make sense but adds, teasingly, “Paradoxes are a welcome antidote to theories which explain everything all too neatly.”

37. How can weak ties be strong? “You are more likely to learn something new from a weak tie,” he tells me. This holds true for a number of reasons. A weak tie is more likely to come from a different background than you, thus the benefits of an immigrant society such as Vienna or Silicon Valley. (Today, 50 percent of all start-ups in Silicon Valley have at least one cofounder who was born outside the United States.) Also, we are more willing to offend someone with whom we have weak ties, and a willingness to offend is an important part of creativity. Strong ties make us feel good, make us feel that we belong, but they also constrict our worldview. A group with strong ties is more likely to lapse into groupthink than one with weak ties.

38. The beauty of Granovetter’s weak-ties theory is that it not only describes the process of Silicon Valley but also many of its products. What is Facebook, after all, but a supermarket of weak ties? Mark Zuckerberg didn’t invent weak ties, but he did make them “a lot less expensive,” says Granovetter.

39. It is not the randomness of meteorological conditions that makes predicting the weather so difficult but their interconnectedness. That sounds an awful lot like creativity, and especially collaborative creativity. When a jazz trio improvises, it produces something that none of the individual musicians could on their own. “Even if we knew everything there was to know about the mental makeup of each musician, we’d still have trouble predicting the emergence of the group’s improvisation,” says psychologist and jazz musician Keith Sawyer. The whole of the ensemble is greater than the sum of its parts. Now take that small ensemble and enlarge it into the size of an orchestra, then a small town, then, larger still, into a teeming city, such as Athens or Florence. You see the problem. Golden ages are nonlinear systems, and these are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict. We can’t explain them by homing in on any single factor. They are complex, interlocking systems, like the weather or a loaf of sourdough. So while we can examine discrete parts of a golden age (tolerance, money, etc.), this doesn’t enable us to predict where and when one will appear. Small inputs balloon into huge, and unexpected, outcomes, but we can’t easily identify which small inputs matter the most. Just as not all butterflies produce a hurricane, not all outbreaks of bubonic plague produce a Renaissance.

40. Another mysterious aspect of creativity centers on what the great historian Arnold Toynbee called “challenge and response.” All great human advancements, he believed, represented a creative response to a challenge. Makes sense. Why, though, do some people respond to personal tragedy—a debilitating illness, the death of a parent at a young age—by shutting down (or acting out), while others use these tragedies as fuel for bursts of creative genius? Likewise, why do some places respond to collective tragedies—an outbreak of plague, for instance—by turning inward, narrowing their gaze, while others expand their horizons and do great things? We don’t know. This is why, I think, we can’t invent a place of genius, any more than we can invent a sunny day.

41. A better set of attributes, I think, are—and I’ll jump on the alliteration bandwagon here—the Three Ds: disorder, diversity, and discernment. Disorder, as we’ve seen, is necessary to shake up the status quo, to create a break in the air. Diversity, of both peoples and viewpoints, is needed to produce not only more dots but also different kinds of dots. Discernment is perhaps the most important, and overlooked, ingredient. Linus Pauling, the renowned chemist and two-time Nobel Prize winner, was once asked by a student how to come up with good ideas. It’s easy, replied Pauling. “You have a lot of ideas and throw away the bad ones.”

## What Technology Wants

1. this growing planetary electronic membrane is already comparable to the complexity of a human brain. It has three billion artificial eyes (phone and webcams) plugged in, it processes keyword searches at the humming rate of 14 kilohertz (a barely audible high-pitched whine), and it is so large a contraption that it now consumes 5 percent of the world’s electricity.

2. the chief advantage of language is not communication but autogeneration. Language is a trick that allows the mind to question itself; a magic mirror that reveals to the mind what the mind thinks; a handle that turns a mind into a tool. With a grip on the slippery, aimless activity of self-awareness and self-reference, language can harness a mind into a fountain of new ideas. Without the cerebral structure of language, we couldn’t access our own mental activity. We certainly couldn’t think the way we do. If our minds can’t tell stories, we can’t consciously create; we can only create by accident. Until we tame the mind with an organization tool capable of communicating to itself, we have stray thoughts without a narrative. We have a feral mind. We have smartness without a tool.

3. But by far the greatest difference between the evolution of the born and the evolution of the made is that species of technology, unlike species in biology, almost never go extinct. A close examination of a supposedly extinct bygone technology almost always shows that somewhere on the planet someone is still producing it. A technique or artifact may be rare in the modern urban world but quite common in the developing rural world. For instance, Burma is full of oxcart technology; basketry is ubiquitous in most of Africa; hand spinning is still thriving in Bolivia. A supposedly dead technology may be enthusiastically embraced by a heritage-based minority in modern society, if only for ritual satisfaction. Consider the traditional ways of the Amish, or modern tribal communities, or fanatical vinyl record collectors. Often old technology is obsolete, that is, it is not very ubiquitous or is second rate, but it still may be in small-time use. For just one of many examples, as late as 1962, in what was then called the atomic age, many small businesses on a block in Boston ran machines using steam power delivered to them by overhead driveshafts. This kind of anachronistic technology is not at all unusual.

## NeuroLogic: The Brain's Hidden Rationale Behind Our Irrational Behavior

6. When we look out into the world, two systems in the brain mold our perceptions. On the one hand, there is the unconscious system that recognizes patterns, anticipates based on those patterns, and deduces how the perceptual fragments fit together. On the other hand, there is the conscious system that accepts the calculations of the unconscious—questioning them when necessary—and formulates decisions based on the wealth of background knowledge to which it has access. Both systems have their uses.
   - Location: 349-354
   - Page: 25

7. The unconscious system in the brain pieces together fragments of our perceptions, anticipating patterns and filling in gaps when necessary, in order to devise a single, meaningful interpretation. It tells a story. The conscious system experiences that story but can also reflect on it and even question it.

8. The sleeping brain is a master storyteller, and that power emerges from its unique environment. When we sleep, our eyes are shut, sounds are muted. Essentially closed off from external sensory noise, the mind begins to fill with imagery generated from within. However, when we dream, we are not completely cut off from the outside. Certain stimuli, like a buzzing insect, can make their way into our nocturnal imagery.
   - Location: 397-401
   - Page: 28

9. Compared with the conscious system, the unconscious abides by a different set of rules. Within each of these systems, different processes are at work that allow for deliberate, conscious reflection during the day and unbounded sensory explorations at night. Yet we have barely seen a glimpse of how these systems function and interact. The hallucinations of Charles Bonnet, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, and peduncular hallucinosis are ways in which they overlap, by allowing dreams—generated by our unconscious circuitry—to invade our waking consciousness. But those are cases of circuit breakdown. Our two systems in the brain are not merely separated by sleep and wakefulness, and they interact far more often than during hallucinations. Modeling the brain as containing two systems of behavioral control—the conscious and the unconscious—goes a long way in explaining not only the subtleties of our everyday thoughts and decisions but also the various ways in which human experience can be disturbed and distorted. There is an underlying logic to the way these two systems interact as well as how they attempt to compensate, for better or worse, when gaps or defects in processing arise. In blindness, the brain may fill the void in perception by generating visual hallucinations or attempting to reconstruct vision using our other senses. In dreams, the unconscious brain collects the random bursts of activity from the brainstem and, as logically as possible, connects them into a single narrative, an all-encompassing fantasy that permeates our minds as we sleep.

10. How can we possibly drive safely while conversing if doing so impairs our vision? It seems obvious that continuous conscious vision is crucial to keep a safe distance from other cars, stay in your lane, make turns, and whatever else you have to do to get home without totaling your car. Yet the research on distracted driving shows that, though your eyes might dart between targets on the road, you often don’t consciously process what you’re looking at. If the conscious experience of vision is turned off, who is controlling the movements of the eyes? The brain takes care of that unconsciously. The unconscious system in the brain is able to generate the necessary eye movements to cars and street signs to keep the driver and passengers out of harm’s way. That’s why accidents are not more frequent and why preoccupied drivers can usually drive safely. Even though conscious vision is limited, the brain’s unconscious processes take over the visual system and guide us to our destination.

11. Research on blindsight shows that patients with isolated damage to the primary visual cortex can correctly identify the location of a target, its color, and even whether it is moving or stationary. Accuracies of up to 100 percent have been reported. What’s more, analysis of eye movements in these patients reveals that they properly move their eyes to focus on the locations of the targets. They are blind, yet they follow objects with their eyes and can accurately describe them.

12. After you had made the trip twenty or thirty times, the drive would become second nature, and your mind would be more likely to wander. What’s changed? The drive has become habit. Maintaining a habit doesn’t seem to require the same level of mental effort that is needed when attempting a task for the first time. Not only does “practice make perfect,” it seems to make our actions automatic.

13. Driving to work is quicker when you don’t have to focus on the naviga tion. However, this system is prone to make errors, as it does when the mouse begins from the north arm or when your presentation is moved to a new location. In contrast, the non-habit system allows the mouse to reflect on its new circumstances and adjust its behavior accordingly.

14. When we’ve practiced something a lot, to the point at which we can do it out of habit, it’s often better if we don’t pay much attention and just let our body do it automatically.

15. A number of distinctions are used to describe the way we store and retrieve information in the brain. One such distinction is between the categories of procedural and episodic memory. Procedural memory is memory for how we do things, like ride a bike, tie a knot, type on a keyboard, or drive a car. This memory becomes stronger the more we practice that procedure. In contrast, episodic memory is for autobiographical events, such as past experiences, feelings, places, and ideas, such as the idea that one must pick up a gallon of milk on the way home. It’s how we remember the episodes that have taken place in our lives.
   - Location: 1197-1201
   - Page: 81

16. Not only do these forms of memory store different types of information, but they also arise from different regions of the brain. Episodic memory is stored in the hippocampus, located deep within the brain and next to the temporal lobe. It tends to be active during non-habit behavior and, as we saw with the mouse in the plus-maze, quiet during habit behavior. On the other hand, procedural memory comes from the outer section of the striatum, the same area responsible for generating habits. This is no coincidence.

17. Not only is habit unable to record information into episodic memory; it can’t retrieve information from it either. It just doesn’t have access. This is the trouble I face as I drive home with my wife’s instructions in the back of my mind. Because I’m spacing out, procedural memory takes over as I drive home. As a result, I lose access to episodic memory and therefore can’t retrieve the important fact that I wanted to remember.

18. In cognitive neuroscience, the term “executive function” is used to describe the highest-order functions of the brain, including planning, decision making, the control of attention, and self-monitoring. Executive function is to the brain as a CEO is to a company. It endows us with the ability to broadly control the way we think and act. When people suffer injury to the frontal lobe and executive functioning is compromised, they can lose the ability to plan, make sound decisions, and even control their own behavior so as to maintain social decorum. What’s more, they tend to act in ways that resemble habit behavior.
   - Location: 1288-1293

19. Allocation of resources for several complex tasks is a difficult endeavor, but the brain does this for us. We are endowed with two parallel systems in the brain that can be used to control behavior. These systems have different strengths and access to different forms of memory. The habit system is procedural, programmable, and fast. It enables us to carry out jobs that are routine, such as driving a familiar route to work or simply turning left in a maze, in a way that is efficient. The automaticity of this system affords us the ability to use our second system simultaneously. This system is that of deliberate, conscious analysis. It may be slower than the habit system, but it is more flexible. It can account for differences in context, such as when construction on the road closes off a familiar driving route and an alternative one must be found. The brain uses its logic to find tasks it can automate, as a computer might free up RAM, so we can focus our conscious efforts on any other undertaking we choose. The key to multitasking is being able to accomplish one of the tasks by habit. Peeling an orange, for example, is something we can easily do while engrossed by our favorite TV show or while speaking to a friend on the phone. However, it would be incredibly difficult to interpret a physics textbook chapter while doing those things. That is not a process that can be automated; it requires conscious attention. But we could read that chapter while peeling an orange because the conscious system can read the chapter and the habit system can peel the orange. This is how we benefit from having dual systems of behavioral control.

20. Experiments have compared the time it takes for people to walk between two points with the time it takes them to imagine making the same trek. Trial after trial, the results showed that the mental and the physical trips take almost exactly the same amount of time. For short walks, the times are within one second of each other. This close correlation occurs when imagining not just walking but any kind of movement. It takes the same amount of time, for example, to imagine yourself drawing a triangle as it does to actually draw it.

21. Just as physically executing a movement and imagining a movement utilize the same brain regions, so too does observing a movement. For example, watching someone move her fingers activates the same region of the brain that you would use to move your own fingers. In addition, just as imagination and action compete for brain resources (it’s difficult to imagine one movement while performing another), observing movement can interfere with our own motor control. For instance, studies show that subjects are worse at performing vertical or horizontal arm movements if they do so while watching arm movements in a different direction. Can you imagine trying to perform a dance routine while the choreographer at the front of the class suddenly decides to try out some new moves? Your own attempt to dance and the conflicting moves you observe will both call upon the same neuronal groups, making it difficult to stay true to your routine.

22. Empathy is the capacity to sense another person’s emotions. Phrases like “I feel for you” and “I feel your pain” are expressions of empathy. By mirror neuron theory, they are also quite appropriate ones. They imply that we feel empathy by experiencing internally what we observe others to be experiencing, and that’s precisely what mirror neurons are thought to do. Though the theory has not been proven, there is emerging evidence that mirror neurons are active as we feel for our fellow man.

23. Why is pornography so effective? Because a person’s brain internally simulates sex as he watches it. His body responds as if he were the one having sex. Though it may not seem as if this has anything to do with empathy, it does. The mirror neuron theory of empathy is that it arises because we internally simulate the experiences of others, whether they be pain or pleasure or even extreme pleasure. The fact that the mirror neuron system is active while a person watches sex is, surprising as it seems, consistent with the neuroscientific view of empathy.

24. Somatic markers are a type of emotional memory, re-instantiations of information that the brain has acquired in the past. But we just experience them as “gut feelings.” Stored and activated unconsciously, these memories emerge at relevant moments in our lives to help guide our decisions.

25. In this chapter, we have seen the ways in which we can train the unconscious system in the brain. Physical practice, mental rehearsal, and observing others are forms of learning that build up neuronal connections through repetitive use. Once we establish this infrastructure, the unconscious brain gives back. In sports, it improves our performance without our having to think about it, strengthening muscle and perfecting technique. Through mirror neurons, it simulates what we see so we can learn about one another, express empathy, and understand pain and pleasure. Finally, through somatic markers, it uses our past experiences to guide future decisions. Through the recollection and rehearsal of past experience, the unconscious simulates old information to help us learn and grow. It draws from our vast store of memories to empower decision making. Memory, however, is not always a dependable source of information. Yet the unconscious depends on it to construct its simulations. So, what happens when that information is incomplete or misleading?

26. The interconnected nature of memory is what allows it to change over time. Just as the brain links memories that have similar features and emphasizes the moments that we consider most significant, it can reorganize those connections later based on new thoughts and experiences. No memory is made in a vacuum, and no memory is fixed. Like any well-written story, memory has a direction and a point of view and is subject to revision.

September 11 was a national tragedy that affected us all, an event that changed the course of history, but the first memory we all share (except for those directly affected) is whatever insignificant activity we were doing on that day. Our recollection of 9/11 is known as a flashbulb memory, a highly detailed vision of a powerful, intensely emotional event.

28. The brain often organizes the snapshots of our history in an ego-protective fashion. If the unconscious brain were a news channel, it would be a biased one. Just as many Democrats watch liberal-leaning television and many Republicans prefer conservative talk radio, the unconscious system has a preference for incorporating life experiences that fall in line with our self-perception and worldview. The brain helps maintain that perspective. It makes the story about us, about the things we care about. Sometimes it fudges the time line a little or conveniently omits the subtle details that don’t neatly fall in line with the story we’d like to believe.

29. We know that memories can be altered or even implanted, such as a person made to falsely remember being lost at the mall. It appears that when the brain is arranging the snapshots of time into continuous memories, those snapshots can come from various sources, whether they be personal experiences or memories of a different kind. The unconscious system collects these snapshots, regardless of their origin, and strings them together in a narrative that aligns with our self-perception.

30. Just as repression protects the ego after emotional trauma, maybe confabulation protects the ego from memory loss or confusion. This would make sense neurologically. Confabulation usually results from damage to the medial temporal lobe—the region responsible for self-centered thinking. It’s the same area that fires when hard-core college basketball fans watch and connect with their favorite players. Damage to the medial temporal lobe places our sense of self under threat. Perhaps confabulation is the brain’s mechanism to preserve it.

31. People with confabulation tend to unconsciously borrow irrelevant thoughts or memories and blend them with ideas they are currently considering. They usually don’t invent things out of thin air. A research group tried testing confabulating patients on memories that they were sure they didn’t have. They asked them questions about completely invented concepts, such as “Where is Premola?” or “Who is Princess Lolita?” or “What is a waterknube?” Confabulating patients were no more likely to fabricate answers to these questions than non-confabulators were. They would just admit ignorance. Having no experience with such topics, they didn’t have any material with which to manufacture a reply.

32. The unconscious system creates connections between various snapshots in our lives, it monitors our emotions at each moment to decide what to emphasize, and it organizes those snapshots in such a way as to tell a story that is unified, straightforward, and, most of all, personal and intimate. That story becomes our conscious life.

33. Mr. Murphy suffered from the Cotard delusion, or “walking corpse syndrome,” a condition in which people believe that they are dead. They feel separated from the world, distant from everyone around them, even the people they know most intimately. As Mr. Murphy described it, “I see everyone moving about and doing their business all around me, but I’m in a different world.” People with Cotard feel as though everyone in the world were acting in a movie—except them. They are spectators emptily watching from afar.
   - Location: 2761-2765
   - Page: 183

34. Nobody knows exactly how the Cotard delusion arises, but the theory is that it’s a failure to connect perceptions with emotions. Neurologically, it’s associated with a disconnect between two areas of the brain: the sensory system and the limbic system. The limbic system processes emotion and memory and includes regions like the amygdala and the hypothalamus, which are located at the interior surface of the temporal lobe. When damage to the temporal and parietal lobes interrupts the communication between the sensory and the limbic systems (or if the limbic system itself is damaged), the theory goes, patients will see, hear, and smell the world as they usually do but without having any emotional reaction.

35. There is a related disorder called Capgras syndrome in which the brain reaches for another, equally bizarre theory. Patients believe that every one they know has been replaced by a physically identical impostor. As one patient tells her doctor, “Every time you left the room, I thought another person dressed in your clothes was coming back into the room…it wasn’t scary, just another person dressed in your clothes, doing your job.” In another, especially illustrative case, a seventy-year-old gentleman whom we’ll call Mr. Patel developed the belief that his wife had been replaced by a stranger who looked like her, behaved like her, and had the same name. According to his wife, Mrs. Patel, the two of them began having sex frequently, far more than usual. However, after intercourse her husband would beg her not to tell his wife about it. Mr. Patel would whisper to her, saying how much he enjoyed their sex and how much better it was than sex with his wife. He even developed new sexual practices. After forty-five years together, Mr. Patel claimed that sex with his wife was too “ordinary,” but it was more exciting with this “new woman.” Mrs. Patel was distraught over her husband’s behavior. He treated her as if she were his mistress. Even though her husband wasn’t actually cheating on her, he believed that he was, and he assumed he was getting away with it.

37. The fact that Brandon, like others with his condition, can interrupt the voice in his head by interrupting his own subvocal speech is further evidence that the voice in his head is actually his own voice. He admits that the voice has surprising access to his knowledge and memories (“he knows everything”). The voice often expresses thoughts that he himself has had. Nobody else hears the voice but him, and he can quiet the voice on occasion by speaking at the same time.

38. Though the deaf do experience a version of auditory hallucinations, it is from inner speech, not subvocal speech, that the voices arise. If auditory hallucinations can happen in people who can’t hear, that implies that not all schizophrenics are hearing their own subvocal speech. Some are experiencing their own imagined inner speech. That means that the neurological problem posed by schizophrenia, the defect in the corollary discharge system, is bigger than we suspected: Schizophrenics lose more than their ability to recognize their own voice. They lose the ability to recognize their own thoughts.
   - Location: 3431-3436
   - Page: 227

39. These symptoms seem to follow the same pattern as auditory hallucinations: attributing self-generated thoughts and actions to external sources. A problem in the corollary discharge system elegantly explains all of these strange experiences in a single model. When a defect in the brain prevents a person from recognizing that she is the author of her thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, she is left to conclude that those thoughts and feelings were implanted in her mind and that those behaviors are controlled by someone else. The presence of these symptoms suggests that schizophrenia is not just a problem of hallucinations and delusions. It is a more general disorder of self-monitoring. It is a disease that causes, among other things, the inability to distinguish self from nonself. And the corollary discharge is at the heart of it all.
   - Location: 3479-3486
   - Page: 230

40. So how does the corollary discharge explain tickling? When you attempt to tickle yourself, a copy of the intended motor action is sent to the sensory system, and the corollary discharge is generated. If the corollary discharge matches the actual sensory experience—the feeling of fingers moving along your ribs at the time and in the pattern that you intended—the brain detects a match and the corollary discharge will dampen the effect of the tickle. In other words, when your brain knows when and how the tickle monster is coming, it’s ready to defend itself. The sensation cancels out, and you don’t get the feeling of tickliness. In contrast, when the timing and pattern of stimulation you feel do not reflect the pattern you intend, as in the second part of the tickling experiment, the corollary discharge will not match the sensory feedback from the skin. The brain will therefore treat the sensation as though it were not self-generated but rather produced by someone else. As a result, you feel the tickliness. The defenses are down, and the tickle monster has free rein.

   - Page: 232

41. If schizophrenia is a problem of self-recognition, as we have said, then the question arises: Can schizophrenics tickle themselves? Because they attribute their own behaviors to external sources, shouldn’t they be unable to distinguish the sensation of trying to tickle themselves from that of being tickled by someone else? When a group of schizophrenic patients compared the sensation of tickling their own hand with that of having their hand tickled by the experimenter, they reported equal levels of tickliness! Because of a global problem in distinguishing self from nonself, schizophrenic patients can do something that the rest of us cannot: they can tickle themselves.

42. How can a never-before-seen place elicit an overwhelming feeling of recognition? When discussing the defect that leads to auditory hallucinations, I mentioned that the brain generates a false negative match; it incorrectly reports that an expected and an actual sensory experience do not match when in fact they do. So what would a false positive match be like? It would be like déjà vu. It would be the feeling of having a personal connection to, or personal ownership of, a certain sensory experience that doesn’t reflect a true connection or true ownership in reality. It would be the feeling of recognition when it doesn’t belong. It’s amazing how such a simple neuronal misfiring can cause such a profound conscious experience. When we talk about individual circuits in the brain, things can seem simple. If the appearance of an ice cream shop matches one in memory, I feel a sense of recognition. If the sound of a voice matches the sound of your voice, then it’s yours. There doesn’t seem to be much to it. It is only when false information is passed around that we can really begin to appreciate how much the brain is doing unconsciously. When my brain misfired in Connecticut, I didn’t just have a feeling of familiarity; I made an assertion regarding my personal travel history. The brain is supremely logical: if I recognize the place in which I am standing, if it matches a place in my memory, then the most likely reason is that I’ve been there in the past. It’s hard for me to remember, so it must have happened a long time ago, when I was a kid. Who would have taken me there? Probably my parents. It’s a sensible story. Yes, the unconscious system used false information to draw the conclusion, but the reasoning itself is sound. My brain just used the information available to fill in the gaps and created a streamlined narrative to make sense of the situation.

43. Hypnosis eliminates the Stroop effect not by preventing conflict monitoring but by interrupting conflict reporting, a feat it accomplishes by disconnecting two regions that would otherwise communicate. Consider what this means. By decoupling the activity in the anterior cingulate cortex from that of the frontal lobe, hypnosis modifies the way the brain sorts through our perceptions, recognizes conflicts, and deals with errors. Gruzelier says that this is why hypnotized people may do outrageous things that they wouldn’t do otherwise.

45. One Brain, Two Systems At any given moment in our lives, innumerable unconscious processes are occurring in our brains. There are subconscious stimuli streaming through the nervous system of every person, leaving unique and often unforeseen neurological footprints. Whether they consist of the jingles or slogans of advertisements, the words we don’t pay attention to at a cocktail party, or the subtle emotions we have whenever we meet someone, visit a new place, or have a distinctive experience, those stimuli have real effects on the way we think and make decisions, but they don’t control us. The totality of these effects, combined with our conscious sensations, knowledge, and memories, is what constitutes our life experience. It helps create the fabric of our vast background knowledge from which we draw our wisdom and insight. Whenever our perceptions are incomplete or whenever we face a scenario in which we don’t have all the facts, the brain unconsciously draws on this background knowledge to help supply the rest of the story. The way we make associations between ideas is guided by the unconscious mind, and we need that perspective to help narrow down the field of choice and, ultimately, to make the best decisions we can. In this book, we have followed two brain systems, the conscious and the unconscious, to see how their interaction engenders our thoughts and behavior. The conscious system gives rise to our life experience. It’s what allows us to feel our senses and emotions, reflect on our thinking, and deliberate our decisions. The conscious system creates our sense of self. The unconscious system, on the other hand, has an extraordinary ability that we have seen demonstrated again and again. It recognizes patterns, using context to anticipate events before they happen. It fills in the gaps, reconciling disconnected elements of our experience in order to maintain a complete personal narrative. The unconscious system does this when stitching together the plotlines of our dreams or generating gut feelings. In memory disorders, it may confabulate, bridging holes in recall by substituting related anecdotes from the brain’s store of knowledge. In schizophrenia, it ventures as far as to fabricate elaborate stories, featuring government conspiracies or supernatural intrusions, to cover up an internal defect in self-recognition. It helps us rationalize our thoughts and behavior, even if we act because of external influences such as hypnosis, subliminal messages, or advertising. The unconscious system in the brain goes to great lengths to fill in the gaps, to rationalize irrational behavior, and to concoct logical explanations for thoroughly illogical situations. Throughout this journey of ours, we’ve seen case after case and study after study that demonstrate that, but the question is, why? Why maintain a complete narrative? Why is it necessary to invent an explanation that reconciles confusing or conflicting experiences? The reason, as we will see, is to preserve our sense of self. As human beings, we have a need to understand the order and organization of the world around us, as well as our place in it. In order to contemplate our needs and desires, as well as to set goals and devise plans to fulfill them, we each must appreciate our personal history, be able to reflect on it, and gain insight into ourselves. Losses of memory, gaps in our perceptions or thinking, conflicts in our experience, external subversions—these are all threats to our personal narrative, and the brain endeavors to protect it. The unconscious system maintains the unity and continuity of the self and will go to extremes to secure that end. There is one circumstance, however, in which the brain goes so far in pursuit of this goal that it actually breaks apart the self in order to preserve it.

46. many aspects of human identity that can be expunged by brain injury: the ability to recognize ourselves and those we care about; the memory of our personal history; a consistent sense of our personality and how we differ from others; a feeling of control over our thoughts and actions.

47. In one experiment, Gazzaniga showed the word “walk” to a split-brain patient’s right hemisphere by placing it in the left visual field. The patient stood up and began walking. When the patient was later asked why he began to walk, he provided a reason: “I wanted to go get a Coke.” The left brain, responsible for language production, generated that explanation, yet it did so without knowing that the instruction “walk” was ever displayed. Only the right brain saw that. The left brain simply made up a reason.
   - Location: 4388-4392
   - Page: 290

48. Even when surgically separated, the two halves of the brain don’t behave as separate entities. They somehow find a way to preserve a unified sense of self by trying to reconcile each other’s behavior. Gazzaniga attributes this phenomenon to the efforts of the left hemisphere, because that’s the side of the brain that came up with all the excuses in his experiments. He hypothesizes that there is a “left-hemisphere interpreter,” a region of the left brain that tries to pull together all of our daily experiences and construct a single, unified narrative to make sense of them. He acknowledges the extensive research we saw that seems to imply that the sense of self emerges from the right hemisphere (specifically the right frontotemporal region, as we saw earlier) but argues that self-processing is actually spread throughout the brain—and the left hemisphere plays a crucial role. It binds our experiences to create our personal stories, our internal, unconscious rationalizations that we’ve been calling neuro-logic. At least in the split-brain experiments, the left brain is filling in the gaps.

49. The brain has a tendency to fill voids in our thinking and perceptions whenever they may be incomplete. Each time the brain fills in the gaps, it does so with a purpose: to preserve our sense of self. The unconscious system is thoroughly focused on protecting our personal narrative, the stability of human identity, and its efforts are never more evident than in cases of emotional trauma.

50. Neuroscientists today have similarly shown that hypnosis can induce the symptoms of conversion disorder. In one case, researchers used hypnosis to induce left leg paralysis in a twenty-five-year-old volunteer. They then asked him to try moving each leg, one at a time, while a PET scanner monitored what his brain was doing. The results showed that as the man moved his right leg (the one unaffected by the hypnosis), the motor cortex illuminated on the PET scan. That’s what we would expect for any healthy person. On the other hand—or other leg, I should say—when the man tried and failed to move his left leg, his motor cortex was quiet. Just as the visual cortex is suppressed in Evelyn’s conversion blindness, the motor cortex can be silenced in hypnotic paralysis. The man’s anterior cingulate, however, was overactive, just as it is in conversion disorder. So, not only can hypnosis cause the symptoms of conversion disorder, it also creates the same pattern of brain activity, just as we saw with dissociation.
   - Location: 4693-4701
   - Page: 310

51. From the clinical standpoint, hypnosis can cause or cure conversion disorder the same way that it can cause or cure dissociative identity disorder. From the neurological standpoint, both conditions exhibit brain activity reminiscent of a hypnotic trance, involving an overactive anterior cingulate cortex.
   - Location: 4717-4720
   - Page: 312

52. Evelyn isn’t the only one to have these two diagnoses simultaneously. People with dissociative identity disorder often have a component of conversion disorder because the two conditions arise from the same cause. What’s more, the alter egos in dissociative identity disorder and the visual or motor changes in conversion disorder emerge in the same way: autosuggestion, or self-hypnosis. To protect human identity from traumatic memories and emotions, the brain focuses our attention away from them, interrupting their access to consciousness.
   - Location: 4732-4737
   - Page: 313

53. Perhaps we can now see why cutting the corpus callosum in split-brain patients does not lead to two distinct selves, yet Evelyn, with no brain injury at all, had her personality fragmented. The answer may lie in the different role of the unconscious system in each case. In a split-brain patient, the unconscious system tries to fill in the gaps, as it would in anyone else. It attempts to reconcile all aspects of experience into a single narrative, even those generated by the opposite hemisphere, in order to preserve the integrity of the self. For those with dissociative disorders, however, the unconscious system in the brain has a different goal. For once, it doesn’t want a single narrative. The single narrative is dangerous, as it would expose the self to toxic information. So, the brain intentionally splits the story. It segregates harmful emotions and memories from the person’s sense of self in order to protect it. For once, the brain doesn’t fill in the gaps.

## Lateral Thinking
**Author:** Edward De Bono

### Highlights (26)

1. Culture is concerned with establishing ideas. Education is concerned with communicating those established ideas. Both are concerned with improving ideas by bringing them up to date. The only available method for changing ideas is conflict which works in two ways. In the first way there is a head on confrontation between opposing ideas. One or other of the ideas achieves a practical dominance over the other idea which is suppressed but not changed. In the second way there is a conflict between new information and the old idea. As a result of this conflict the old idea is supposed to be changed. This is the method of science which is always seeking to generate new information to upset the old ideas and bring about new ones. It is more than the method of science — it is the method of human knowledge.

2. Insight, creativity and humour are so elusive because the mind is so efficient The mind functions to create patterns out of its surroundings. Once the patterns are formed it becomes possible to recognize them, to react to them, to use them. As the patterns are used they become ever more firmly established.
   - Location: 104-107
   - Page: 7

3. But inseparable from the great usefulness of a patterning system are certain limitations. In such a system it is easy to combine patterns or to add to them but it is extremely difficult to restructure them for the patterns control attention. Insight and humour both involve the restructuring of patterns. Creativity also involves restructuring but with more emphasis on the escape from restricting patterns. Lateral thinking involves restructuring, escape and the provocation of new patterns.
   - Location: 112-116
   - Page: 8

4. Lateral thinking is also concerned with breaking out of the concept prisons of old ideas. This leads to changes in attitude and approach; to looking in a different way at things which have always been looked at in the same way. Liberation from old ideas and the stimulation of new ones are twin aspects of lateral thinking.
   - Location: 125-127
   - Page: 9

5. The purpose of thinking is to collect information and to make the best possible use of it Because of the way the mind works to create fixed concept patterns we cannot make the best use of new information unless we have some means for restructuring the old patterns and bringing them up to date. Our traditional methods of thinking teach us how to refine such patterns and establish their validity. But we shall always make less than the best use of available information unless we know how to create new patterns and escape from the dominance of the old ones. Vertical thinking is concerned with proving or developing concept patterns. Lateral thinking is concerned with restructuring such patterns (insight) and provoking new ones (creativity). Lateral and vertical thinking are complementary. Skill in both is necessary. Yet the emphasis in education has always been exclusively on vertical thinking. The need for lateral thinking arises from the limitations of the behaviour of mind as a self-maximizing memory system.

6. A landscape is a memory surface. The contours of the surface offer an accumulated memory trace of the water that has fallen upon it The rainfall forms little rivulets which combine into streams and then into rivers. Once the pattern of drainage has been formed then it tends to become ever more permanent since the rain is collected into the drainage channels and tends to make them deeper. It is the rainfall that is doing the sculpting and yet it is the response of the surface to the rainfall that is organizing how the rainfall will do its sculpting. With a landscape the physical properties of the surface will have a strong effect on the way the rainfall affects the surface. The nature of the surface will determine what sort of river is formed. Outcrops of rock will determine which way the river goes.

7. there is often an alternative way of arranging available information. This means that there can be a switch over to another arrangement Usually this switch over is sudden.* If the switch over is temporary it gives rise to humour. If the switch over is permanent it gives rise to insight It is interesting that the reaction to an insight solution is often laughter even when there is nothing funny about the solution itself.

8. The mind handles information in a characteristic way. This way is very effective and it has huge practical advantages. But it also has limitations. In particular the mind is good at establishing concept patterns but not at restructuring them to bring them up to date. It is from these inherent limitations that the need for lateral thinking arises.

19. The differences between lateral and vertical thinking are very fundamental. The processes are quite distinct. It is not a matter of one process being more effective than the other for both are necessary. It is a matter of realizing the differences in order to be able to use both effectively. With vertical thinking one uses information for its own sake in order to move forward to a solution. With lateral thinking one uses information not for its own sake but provocatively in order to bring about repatterning.

24. New ideas Most of the time one is not conscious of the need for new ideas even though one is grateful enough when they turn up. One does not try and generate new ideas because one suspects that new ideas cannot be generated by trying. Though new ideas are always useful there are times when one is very much aware of the need for a new idea. There are also jobs which demand a continual flow of new ideas (research, design, architecture, engineering, advertising etc). The deliberate generation of new ideas is always difficult Vertical thinking is not much help otherwise new ideas would be far easier to come by, indeed one would be able to programme a computer to churn them out One can wait for chance or inspiration or one can pray for the gift of creativity. Lateral thinking is a rather more deliberate way of setting about it. Many people suppose that new ideas mean new inventions in the form of mechanical contrivances. This is perhaps the most obvious form a new idea can take but new ideas include new ways of doing things, new ways of looking at things, new ways of organizing things, new ways of presenting things, new ideas about ideas. From advertising to engineering, from art to mathematics, from cooking to sport, new ideas are always in demand. This demand need not be just a general indication but can be as specific as one likes. One can actually set out to generate new ideas.

25. Problem solving Even if one has no incentive to generate new ideas problems are thrust upon one. There is little choice but to try and solve them. A problem does not have to be presented in a formal manner nor is it a matter for pencil and paper working out A problem is simply the difference between what one has and what one wants. It may be a matter of avoiding something, of getting something, of getting rid of something, of getting to know what one wants.

## Objectivity
**Author:** Stephen Gaukroger

### Highlights (1)

1. Objectivity requires us to stand back from our perceptions, our beliefs and opinions, to reflect on them, and subject them to a particular kind of scrutiny and judgement. Above all, it requires a degree of indifference in judging that may conflict with our needs and desires.

Remember how earnestly she begged you not to tell a soul? And remember what you did next? Well, if you’re like most people, you probably went and told someone else. (Don’t be embarrassed, your secret is safe with me.) As it turns out, if something is supposed to be secret, people might well be more likely to talk about it. The reason? Social currency.

6. Word of mouth, then, is a prime tool for making a good impression—as potent as that new car or Prada handbag. Think of it as a kind of currency. Social currency. Just as people use money to buy products or services, they use social currency to achieve desired positive impressions among their families, friends, and colleagues.

7. Remarkable things provide social currency because they make the people who talk about them seem, well, more remarkable. Some people like to be the life of the party, but no one wants to be the death of it. We all want to be liked. The desire for social approval is a fundamental human motivation. If we tell someone a cool Snapple fact it makes us seem more engaging. If we tell someone about a secret bar hidden inside a hot dog restaurant, it makes us seem cool. Sharing extraordinary, novel, or entertaining stories or ads makes people seem more extraordinary, novel, and entertaining. It makes them more fun to talk to, more likely to get asked to lunch, and more likely to get invited back for a second date.

8. group of psychologists from the University of Illinois recruited pairs of students for what seemed like a study of group planning and performance. Students were told they would get to cook a small meal together and were escorted to a real working kitchen. In front of them were all the ingredients necessary to cook a meal. Piles of leafy green vegetables, fresh chicken, and succulent pink shrimp, all ready to be chopped and thrown into a pan. But then things got interesting. Hidden among the vegetables and chicken, the researchers had planted a small—but decidedly creepy—family of cockroaches. Eww! The students shrieked and recoiled from the food. After the bedlam subsided, the experimenter said that someone must be playing a joke on them and quickly canceled the study. But rather than send people home early, he suggested that they go participate in another study that was (conveniently) taking place just next door. They all walked over, but along the way they were quizzed about what had happened during the aborted experiment. Half were asked by the experimenter, while the other half were asked by what seemed like another student (who was actually covertly helping the experimenter). Depending on whom participants happened to tell the story to, it came out differently. If they were talking to another student—that is, if they were trying to impress and entertain rather than simply report the facts—the cockroaches were larger, more numerous, and the entire experience more disgusting. The students exaggerated the details to make the story more remarkable. We’ve all had similar experiences. How big was the trout we caught last time we went fishing in Colorado? How many times did the baby wake up crying during the night? Often we’re not even trying to exaggerate; we just can’t recall all the details of the story. Our memories aren’t perfect records of what happened. They’re more like dinosaur skeletons patched together by archeologists. We have the main chunks, but some of the pieces are missing, so we fill them in as best we can. We make an educated guess. But in the process, stories often become more extreme or entertaining, particularly when people tell them in front of a group. We don’t just guess randomly, we fill in numbers or information to make us look good rather than inept. The fish doubles in size. The baby didn’t wake just twice during the night—that wouldn’t be remarkable enough—she woke seven times and required skillful parenting each time to soothe her back to sleep.

11. Toilet paper? Hardly seems remarkable. But a few years ago I made toilet paper one of the most talked-about conversation topics at a party. How? I put a roll of black toilet paper in the bathroom. Black toilet paper? No one had ever seen black toilet paper before. And that remarkability provoked discussion. Emphasize what’s remarkable about a product or idea and people will talk.

12. A few years ago, students at Harvard University were asked to make a seemingly straightforward choice: which would they prefer, a job where they made $50,000 a year (option A) or one where they made $100,000 a year (option B)? Seems like a no-brainer, right? Everyone should take option B. But there was one catch. In option A, the students would get paid twice as much as others, who would only get $25,000. In option B, they would get paid half as much as others, who would get $200,000. So option B would make the students more money overall, but they would be doing worse than others around them. What did the majority of people choose? Option A. They preferred to do better than others, even if it meant getting less for themselves. They chose the option that was worse in absolute terms but better in relative terms. People don’t just care about how they are doing, they care about their performance in relation to others. Getting to board a plane a few minutes early is a nice perk of achieving Premier status. But part of what makes this a nice perk is that you get to board before everyone else. Because levels work on two, well, levels. They tell us where we are at any time in absolute terms. But they also make clear where we stand relative to everyone else. Just like many other animals, people care about hierarchy. Apes engage in status displays and dogs try to figure out who is the alpha.

15. Back in mid-1997, the candy company Mars noticed an unexpected uptick in sales of its Mars bar. The company was surprised because it hadn’t changed its marketing in any way. It wasn’t spending additional money on advertising, it hadn’t changed its pricing, and it hadn’t run any special promotions. Yet sales had gone up. What had happened? NASA had happened. Specifically, NASA’s Pathfinder mission.

In this way, Ziploc bags are the antithesis of me going to teach dressed like a pirate. The pirate story is interesting, but it’s here today, gone tomorrow. Ziploc bags may be boring, but they get mentioned week in and week out because they are frequently triggered. By acting as reminders, triggers not only get people talking, they keep them talking.

18. So rather than just going for a catchy message, consider the context. Think about whether the message will be triggered by the everyday environments of the target audience. Going for interesting is our default tendency. Whether running for class president or selling soda, we think that catchy or clever slogans will get us where we need to go. But as we saw in our fruits and vegetables study, a strong trigger can be much more effective than a catchy slogan.

19. The more the desired behavior happens after a delay, the more important being triggered becomes. Market research often focuses on consumers’ immediate reaction to an advertising message or campaign. That might be valuable in situations where the consumer is immediately offered a chance to buy the product. But in most cases, people hear an ad one day and then go to the store days or weeks later. If they’re not triggered to think about it, how will they remember that ad when they’re at the store?

20. Products and ideas also have habitats, or sets of triggers that cause people to think about them. Take hot dogs. Barbecues, summertime, baseball games, and even wiener dogs (dachshunds) are just a few of the triggers that make up the habitat for hot dogs. Compare that with the habitat for Ethiopian food. What triggers most people to think of Ethiopian food? Ethiopian food is certainly delicious, but its habitat is not as prevalent.

22. According to psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt, awe is the sense of wonder and amazement that occurs when someone is inspired by great knowledge, beauty, sublimity, or might. It’s the experience of confronting something greater than yourself. Awe expands one’s frame of reference and drives self-transcendence. It encompasses admiration and inspiration and can be evoked by everything from great works of art or music to religious transformations, from breathtaking natural landscapes to human feats of daring and discovery. Awe is a complex emotion and frequently involves a sense of surprise, unexpectedness, or mystery.

23. KINDLING THE FIRE: THE SCIENCE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL The idea that emotions can be categorized as positive or pleasant and negative or unpleasant has been around for hundreds if not thousands of years. Even a child can tell you that happiness or excitement feels good and anxiety or sadness feels bad. More recently, however, psychologists have argued that emotions can also be classified based on a second dimension. That of activation, or physiological arousal. What is physiological arousal? Think about the last time you gave a speech in front of a large audience. Or when your team was on the verge of winning a huge game. Your pulse raced, your palms sweated, and you could feel your heart pounding in your chest. You may have had similar feelings the last time you saw a scary movie or went camping and heard a weird noise outside your tent. Though your head kept saying you weren’t really in danger, your body was convinced otherwise. Every sense was heightened. Your muscles were tensed and you were alert to every sound, smell, and movement. This is arousal.

26. In their wonderful book Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath talk about using the “Three Whys” to find the emotional core of an idea. Write down why you think people are doing something. Then ask “Why is this important?” three times. Each time you do this, note your answer, and you’ll notice that you drill down further and further toward uncovering not only the core of an idea, but the emotion behind it. Take online search. Why is search important? Because people want to find information quickly. Why do they want to do that? So they can get answers to what they are looking for. Why do they want those answers? So they can connect with people, achieve their goals, and fulfill their dreams. Now that’s starting to get more emotional.

27. If situational factors end up making us physiologically aroused, we may end up sharing more than we planned. So be careful the next time you step off the treadmill, barely avoid a car accident, or experience a turbulent plane ride. Because you’ve been aroused by these experiences, you may overshare information with others in the aftermath.

29. Emotions drive people to action. They make us laugh, shout, and cry, and they make us talk, share, and buy. So rather than quoting statistics or providing information, we need to focus on feelings. As Anthony Cafaro, the designer who helped develop the “Parisian Love” video at Google, noted: Whether it’s a digital product, like Google, or a physical product, like sneakers, you should make something that will move people. People don’t want to feel like they’re being told something—they want to be entertained, they want to be moved. Some emotions kindle the fire more than others. As we discussed, activating emotion is the key to transmission. Physiological arousal or activation drives people to talk and share. We need to get people excited or make them laugh. We need to make them angry rather than sad. Even situations where people are active can make them more likely to pass things on to others.

30. The fact that most students were against binge drinking seemed to bode well for eliminating the drinking problem—until she thought about it closely. If most students were uncomfortable with the drinking culture, then why was it happening in the first place? Why were students drinking so much if they don’t actually like it? Because behavior is public and thoughts are private. Put yourself in a college student’s situation. When you look around, you’d see a lot of drinking. You’d see tailgates at the football games, keg parties at the frat house, and open bars at the sorority formal. You’d witness your peers drinking and seeming happy about it, so you’d assume that you are the outlier and that everyone else likes drinking more than you do. So you’d have another drink. But what students don’t realize is that everyone is having similar thoughts. Their peers are having the same experience. They see others drinking, so they drink, too. And the cycle continues because people can’t read one another’s thoughts. If they could, they’d realize that everyone felt the same way. And they wouldn’t feel all this social proof compelling them to drink as much. For a more familiar example, think about the last time you sat through a bewildering PowerPoint presentation. Something about equity diversification or supply chain reorganization. At the end of the talk, the speaker probably asked the audience if anyone had any questions. The response? Silence. But not because everyone else understood the presentation. The others were probably just as bewildered as you were. But while they would have liked to raise their hands, they didn’t because each one is worried that he or she is the only person who didn’t understand. Why? Because no one else was asking questions. No one saw any public signal that others were confused so everyone keeps his doubts to him- or herself. Because behavior is public and thoughts are private.

31. Observability has a huge impact on whether products and ideas catch on. Say a clothing company introduces a new shirt style. If you see someone wearing it and decide you like it, you can go buy the same shirt, or something similar. But this is much less likely to happen with socks. Why? Because shirts are public and socks are private. They’re harder to see.
   - Location: 1784-1787

32. If people can’t see what others are choosing and doing, they can’t imitate them. And, like the binge-drinking college students, people might change their behavior for the worse because they feel their views aren’t supported.* Solving this problem requires making the private public. Generating public signals for private choices, actions, and opinions. Taking what was once an unobservable thought or behavior and transforming it into a more observable one. Koreen Johannessen was able to reduce Arizona students’ drinking by making the private public. She created ads in the school newspaper that merely stated the true norm. That most students had only one or two drinks, and 69 percent have four or fewer drinks, when they party. She didn’t focus on the health consequences of drinking, she focused on social information. By showing students that the majority of their peers weren’t bingeing, she helped them realize that others felt the same way. That most students didn’t want to binge. This corrected the false inferences students had made about others’ behavior and led them to reduce their own drinking as a result.

33. Designing products that advertise themselves is a particularly powerful strategy for small companies or organizations that don’t have a lot of resources. Even when there is no money to buy television ads or a spot in the local paper, existing customers can act as advertisements if the product advertises itself. It’s like advertising without an advertising budget.

34. But when publicly visible, these remnants facilitate imitation and provide chances for people to talk about related products or ideas. Take voting. It’s hard to get people to turn out to vote. They have to figure out where their polling stations are located, take the morning off from work, and stand in line, sometimes for hours, until they get the chance to cast their ballots. But these hurdles are compounded by the fact that voting is a private act. Unless you actually happen to see all the people who go to the polls, you have no idea how many other people decided voting was worth the effort. So there is not much social proof. But in the 1980s election officials came up with a nice way to make voting more observable: the “I Voted” sticker. Simple enough, but by creating behavioral residue, the sticker made the private act of voting much more public, even after people left the polling station. It provided a ready reminder that today is the day to vote, others are doing it, and you should too.

35. Communications professor Bob Hornik wanted to see whether anti-drug ads were actually effective. So he collected data on the drug use of thousands of teens over the time the anti-drug ads ran. Whether teens had seen the ads and whether they had ever smoked marijuana. Then he looked at whether the public service announcements seemed to decrease marijuana use. They didn’t. In fact, the messages actually seemed to increase drug use. Kids aged twelve and a half to eighteen who saw the ads were actually more likely to smoke marijuana. Why? Because it made drug use more public.
   - Location: 1990-1995
   - Page: 130

36. But anti-drug ads often say two things simultaneously. They say that drugs are bad, but they also say that other people are doing them. And as we’ve discussed throughout this chapter, the more others seem to be doing something, the more likely people are to think that thing is right or normal and what they should be doing as well. Imagine you’re a fifteen-year-old who has never considered using drugs. You’re sitting at home watching cartoons one afternoon when a public service announcement comes on telling you about the dangers of drug use. Someone’s going to ask you if you want to try drugs and you need to be ready to say no. Or even worse, the cool kids are going to be the ones asking. But you shouldn’t say yes. You never see public service announcements for avoiding cutting off your hand with a saw or not getting hit by a bus, so if the government spent the time and money to tell you about drugs, a lot of your peers must be doing them, right? Some of them are apparently the coolest kids in school. And you had no idea! As Hornik said, Our basic hypothesis is that the more kids saw these ads, the more they came to believe that lots of other kids were using marijuana. And the more they came to believe that other kids were using marijuana, the more they became interested in using it themselves. As with many powerful tools, making things more public can have unintended consequences when not applied carefully. If you want to get people not to do something, don’t tell them that lots of their peers are doing it.

37. It’s been said that when people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate one another. We look to others for information about what is right or good to do in a given situation, and this social proof shapes everything from the products we buy to the candidates we vote for. But as we discussed, the phrase “Monkey see, monkey do” captures more than just our tendency to follow others. If people can’t see what others are doing, they can’t imitate them. So to get our products and ideas to become popular we need to make them more publicly observable. For Apple this was as easy as flipping its logo. By cleverly leveraging moustaches, Movember drew huge attention and donations for men’s cancer research. So we need to be like Hotmail and Apple and design products that advertise themselves. We need to be like Lululemon and Livestrong and create behavioral residue, discernible evidence that sticks around even after people have used our product or engaged with our ideas. We need to make the private public. If something is built to show, it’s built to grow.

38. When writer and editor William F. Buckley Jr. was asked which single book he would take with him to a desert island, his reply was straightforward: “A book on shipbuilding.” Useful things are important. Further, as the stories of Ken’s corn and the vacuum-discussing hikers illustrate, people don’t just value practical information, they share it. Offering practical value helps make things contagious.

39. Kahneman received the Nobel for his work with Amos Tversky on what they called “prospect theory.” The theory is amazingly rich, but at its core, it’s based on a very basic idea. The way people actually make decisions often violates standard economic assumptions about how they should make decisions. Judgments and decisions are not always rational or optimal. Instead, they are based on psychological principles of how people perceive and process information. Just as perceptual processes influence whether we see a particular sweater as red or view an object on the horizon as far away, they also influence whether a price seems high or a deal seems good. Along with Richard Thaler’s work, Kahneman and Tversky’s research is some of the earliest studying what we now think of as “behavioral economics.” ————— One of the main tenets of prospect theory is that people don’t evaluate things in absolute terms. They evaluate them relative to a comparison standard, or “reference point.” Fifty cents for coffee isn’t just fifty cents for coffee. Whether that seems like a fair price or not depends on your expectations. If you live in New York City, paying fifty cents for a cup of coffee seems pretty cheap. You’d chuckle at your good luck and buy coffee from that place every day. You might even tell your friends. If you live in rural India, though, fifty cents might seem hugely expensive. It would be way more than you would dream of paying for coffee and you’d never buy it. If you told your friends anything it would be your outrage at the price gouging. You see the same phenomenon at work if you go to the movies or the store with people in their seventies or eighties. They often complain about the prices. “What?” they exclaim. “No way am I paying eleven dollars for a movie ticket. That’s such a rip-off!” It might seem that old people are stingier than the rest of us. But there is a more fundamental reason that they think the prices are unfair. They have different reference points. They remember the days when a movie ticket was forty cents and steak was ninety-five cents a pound, when toothpaste was twenty-nine cents and paper towels cost a dime. Because of that, it’s hard for them to see today’s prices as fair. The prices seem so much higher than what they remember, so they balk at paying them.

42. A NOTE ON TRUTH You may have heard that vaccines cause autism. If so, you’re not alone. In 1998, a paper was published in a medical journal suggesting that an immunization against measles, mumps, and rubella could cause autism in children. Health-related news spreads fast, particularly when it relates to kids, and soon lots of people were talking about the potential downsides to vaccines. As a result, childhood vaccination rates decreased. All this would be good if the link between vaccines and autism were true. But it’s not. There is no scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. The original paper turned out to be a fraud. The doctor who authored it had manipulated evidence, apparently owing to conflict of interest, and after being found guilty of serious professional misconduct, lost his medical license. But even though the information was false, lots of people shared it. The reason is practical value. People weren’t trying to share false things, they just heard something they thought was useful and they wanted others’ kids to be safe. But many people didn’t hear the news that the original report had been discredited, and so they continued to share an incorrect narrative. Our desire to share helpful things is so powerful that it can make even false ideas succeed. Sometimes the drive to help takes a wrong turn. So the next time someone tells you about a miracle cure, or warns about the health risks of a particular food or behavior, try to verify that information independently before you pass it on. False information can spread just as quickly as the truth.

43. Practical value is about helping. This chapter discussed the mechanics of value and the psychology of deals, but it’s important to remember why people share that type of information in the first place. People like to help one another. We go out of our way to give advice or send others information that will make them better off. Sure, some of this may be selfish. We think we’re right and we can’t help but toss our two cents into other people’s lives. But not all of it is about us. It’s also about altruism, the inherent goodness of people. We care about others and we want to make their lives better.

44. Of the six principles of contagiousness that we discuss in the book, Practical Value may be the easiest to apply. Some products and ideas already have lots of Social Currency, but to build it into a video for a blender takes some energy and creativity. Figuring out how to create Triggers also requires some effort, as does evoking emotion. But finding Practical Value isn’t hard. Almost every product or idea imaginable has something useful about it. Whether it saves people money, makes them happier, improves health, or saves them time, all of these things are news you can use. So thinking about why people gravitate to our product or idea in the first place will give us a good sense of the underlying practical value. The harder part is cutting through the clutter. There are lots of good restaurants and helpful websites, so we need to make our product or idea stand out. We need to highlight incredible value and use the Rule of 100. Like Vanguard, we need to package our knowledge and expertise so that people learn about us while they pass it along. We need to make it clear why our product or idea is so useful that people just have to spread the word. News you can use.

45. the story of the Trojan Horse also carries an underlying message: “Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.” A more general interpretation would be “never trust your enemies, even when they seem friendly.” In fact it is exactly when they are making such overtures that you should be especially suspicious. So the tale of the Trojan Horse is more than just an entertaining story. It also teaches an important lesson. Still, if Homer and Virgil had simply wanted to teach people a lesson, couldn’t they have done it more efficiently? Couldn’t they have gotten right to the point rather than writing an epic poem with hundreds of lines of poetry? Of course. But would the lesson have had the same impact? Probably not. By encasing the lesson in a story, these early writers ensured that it would be passed along—and perhaps even be believed more wholeheartedly than if the lesson’s words were spoken simply and plainly. That’s because people don’t think in terms of information. They think in terms of narratives. But while people focus on the story itself, information comes along for the ride.

46. BUILD A TROJAN HORSE Stories thus give people an easy way to talk about products and ideas. Subway might have low-fat subs, and Lands’ End might have great customer service, but outside of triggers in a conversation, people need a reason to bring that information up. And good stories provide that reason. They provide a sort of psychological cover that allows people to talk about a product or idea without seeming like an advertisement. So how can we use stories to get people talking? We need to build our own Trojan Horse—a carrier narrative that people will share, while talking about our product or idea along the way.

48. If you want to craft contagious content, try to build your own Trojan Horse. But make sure you think about valuable virality. Make sure the information you want people to remember and transmit is critical to the narrative. Sure, you can make your narrative funny, surprising, or entertaining. But if people don’t connect the content back to you, it’s not going to help you very much. Even if it goes viral. So build a Social Currency–laden, Triggered, Emotional, Public, Practically Valuable Trojan Horse, but don’t forget to hide your message inside. Make sure your desired information is so embedded into the plot that people can’t tell the story without it.

How can you grow the habitat and make it come to mind more often?    Emotion    Focus on feelings. Does talking about your product or idea generate emotion? How can you kindle the fire?    Public    Does your product or idea advertise itself? Can people see when others are using it? If not, how can you make the private public? Can you create behavioral residue that sticks around even after people use it?    Practical Value    Does talking about your product or idea help people help others? How can you highlight incredible value, packaging your knowledge and expertise into useful information others will want to disseminate?    Stories    What is your Trojan Horse? Is your product or idea embedded in a broader narrative that people want to share? Is the story not only viral, but also valuable?

## Man the Hunted
**Author:** Donna Hart

### Highlights (1)

1. During one decade near the end of the twentieth century (between 1975 and 1985) 425 people were killed by tigers on the Indian portion of the delta and another 187 on the Bangladesh side.7 Plastic face masks—constructed to be worn on the back of the head—have been distributed by the Indian authorities. Locals wear them as a deterrent to tiger predation while they are boating through the swamps in the Sundarbans delta. These masks help reduce tiger attacks because big cats like to stalk prey that are unaware of impending danger.

1. Memory scientists often speak of the important difference between knowing that a certain fact is true and knowing how you came to learn it. For example, here’s a simple question: What’s the capital of France? The answer probably leapt to your mind in an instant. Now, here’s another question: When exactly did you learn that Paris is the capital of France? If you’re like most people, you have no idea. That particular fact twinkles in your mind amid an enormous constellation of other facts, most of them forever disconnected from the moment they first sprang to life. That store of mostly disconnected facts is known as your semantic memory. Your semantic memory is contrasted with your episodic memory, which is your memory of fleshed-out narratives rather than merely facts. When you engage your episodic memory, you engage in a form of mental time travel, bringing yourself back to a particular place and time, reimagining a scene you’ve already lived. When you engage your semantic memory you are doing the mental equivalent of flipping through an encyclopedia or photo album, plucking out bits of information whose origins might be unclear. Incidentally, semantic memory can also be autobiographical. You might know for certain that you are capable of walking on your hands without remembering the day you first learned how to do so. In neuroscientific shorthand, this is known as the difference between “knowing that” and “knowing how.”

2. Through a series of experiments, Corkin and her colleagues demonstrated that virtually all of Henry’s episodic memories, even the ones that had been created prior to the operation, either no longer existed or were completely inaccessible to him. He didn’t just have no postoperative episodic memories, he had no episodic memories, period. Instead of being able to do what the rest of us can do—use our minds to reexperience and reexamine many of the stories of our lives—Henry was left with the ability only to rifle through his mind’s files of disconnected facts, never knowing the context or origins of any of them, never stringing them together into real, living narratives. As Corkin put it, Henry’s entire past, even predating the operation, had become “semanticized.”

3. Memory scientists divide amnesia into two basic types: anterograde and retrograde. Anterograde means “moving forward” and retrograde means “moving backward.” It was obvious since almost the moment he emerged from the operating room that Henry suffered from profound anterograde amnesia: He could hardly remember any new events as he moved forward through time. But he also, though less obviously, suffered from severe retrograde amnesia. Many of the years immediately preceding the operation were blank to him, and interviews helped paint a picture of just how far back Henry’s retrograde amnesia stretched. His personal recollection of major world events appeared to be more or less intact up to 1944 and the German surrender. His personal recollection of the Japanese surrender the following year, however, appeared to have dropped away. He could remember where he was at the beginning of the war but not the end. This fit nicely with the dominant theory of how experiences are turned into permanent long-term memories. According to that theory, memory traces—the first products of lived experiences—exist in a fragile, impermanent state for years, a limbo of sorts. These traces reside in various parts of the brain, but if they’re going to stay accessible down the road, the hippocampus must work on them, strengthening them, sending neural impulses to them and receiving impulses from them for years, until one day they become strong enough to live on their own, at least somewhat independent of the medial temporal lobes.

1. all. There's a beauty to imperfection. This is the essence of the Japanese principle of wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi values character and uniqueness over a shiny facade. It teaches that cracks and scratches in things should be embraced. It's also about simplicity. You strip things down and then use what you have. Leonard Koren, author of a book on wabi-sabi, gives this advice: Pare down to the essence, but don't remove the poetry. Keep things clean and unencumbered but don't sterilize.

## Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
**Author:** Yuval Noah Harari

### Highlights (51)

1. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government diverting money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to neurons. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy for survival on the savannah. A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.

2. nuts, insects and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.

3. beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started doing very special things. Around that date Sapiens bands left Africa for a second time. This time they drove the Neanderthals and all other human species not only from the Middle East, but from the face of the earth. Within a remarkably short period, Sapiens reached Europe and East Asia. About 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea and landed in Australia – a continent hitherto untouched by humans. The period from about 70,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago witnessed the invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (essential for sewing warm clothing). The first objects that can reliably be called art date from this era (see the Stadel lion-man on this page), as does the first clear evidence for religion, commerce and social stratification. Most researchers believe that these unprecedented accomplishments were the product of a revolution in Sapiens’ cognitive abilities. They maintain that the people who drove the Neanderthals to extinction, settled Australia, and carved the Stadel lion-man were as intelligent, creative and sensitive as we are. If we were to come across the artists of the Stadel Cave, we could learn their language and they ours. We’d be able to explain to them everything we know – from the adventures of Alice in Wonderland to the paradoxes of quantum physics – and they could teach us how their people view the world. The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that

5. What, then, is so special about our language? The most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison. A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means of sharing information about the world. But the most important information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison. Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.

6. Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid. Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled. Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the Cognitive Revolution. Many animals and human species could previously say, ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our tribe.’ This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of Sapiens language.

7. once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust. How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.
   - Location: 447-452
   - Page: 30

8. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths. Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees. Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.
   - Location: 452-460

9. Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals. Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.

11. It is, however, a mistake to look for the differences at the level of the individual or the family. One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding. If you tried to bunch together thousands of chimpanzees into Tiananmen Square, Wall Street, the Vatican or the headquarters of the United Nations, the result would be pandemonium. By contrast, Sapiens regularly gather by the thousands in such places. Together, they create orderly patterns – such as trade networks, mass celebrations and political institutions – that they could never have created in isolation. The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups.

12. We obviously have no written records from the age of foragers, and the archaeological evidence consists mainly of fossilised bones and stone tools. Artefacts made of more perishable materials – such as wood, bamboo or leather – survive only under unique conditions. The common impression that pre-agricultural humans lived in an age of stone is a misconception based on this archaeological bias. The Stone Age should more accurately be called the Wood Age, because most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were made of wood.

13. The heated debates about Homo sapiens’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities.

   - Page: 49

14. There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging.5 Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. Foragers mastered not only the surrounding world of animals, plants and objects, but also the internal world of their own bodies and senses. They listened to the slightest movement in the grass to learn whether a snake might be lurking there. They carefully observed the foliage of trees in order to discover fruits, beehives and bird nests. They moved with a minimum of effort and noise, and knew how to sit, walk and run in the most agile and efficient manner. Varied and constant use of their bodies made them as fit as marathon runners. They had physical dexterity that people today are unable to achieve even after years of practising yoga or t’ai chi.

15. One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it. Let’s take another familiar example from our own time. Over the last few decades, we have invented countless time-saving devices that are supposed to make life more relaxed – washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, telephones, mobile phones, computers, email. Previously it took a lot of work to write a letter, address and stamp an envelope, and take it to the mailbox. It took days or weeks, maybe even months, to get a reply. Nowadays I can dash off an email, send it halfway around the globe, and (if my addressee is online) receive a reply a minute later. I’ve saved all that trouble and time, but do I live a more relaxed life? Sadly not. Back in the snail-mail era, people usually only wrote letters when they had something important to relate. Rather than writing the first thing that came into their heads, they considered carefully what they wanted to say and how to phrase it. They expected to receive a similarly considered answer. Most people wrote and received no more than a handful of letters a month and seldom felt compelled to reply immediately. Today I receive dozens of emails each day, all from people who expect a prompt reply. We thought we were saving time; instead we revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed and made our days more anxious and agitated.

16. The story of the luxury trap carries with it an important lesson. Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted. Nobody plotted the Agricultural Revolution or sought human dependence on cereal cultivation. A series of trivial decisions aimed mostly at filling a few stomachs and gaining a little security had the cumulative effect of forcing ancient foragers to spend their days carrying water buckets under a scorching sun.

17. A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them. In order to safeguard an imagined order, continuous and strenuous efforts are imperative. Some of these efforts take the shape of violence and coercion. Armies, police forces, courts and prisons are ceaselessly at work forcing people to act in accordance with the imagined order.

18. Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food) or a service (housekeeping, relationship therapy, yoga classes). Every television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service will make life better. Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism. Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‘market of experiences’, on which the modern tourism industry is founded. The tourism industry does not sell flight tickets and hotel bedrooms. It sells experiences. Paris is not a city, nor India a country – they are both experiences, the consumption of which is supposed to widen our horizons, fulfil our human potential, and make us happier.

19. The earliest Sumerian writing was a partial rather than a full script. Full script is a system of material signs that can represent spoken language more or less completely. It can therefore express everything people can say, including poetry. Partial script, on the other hand, is a system of material signs that can represent only particular types of information, belonging to a limited field of activity. Latin script, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Braille are full scripts. You can use them to write tax registers, love poems, history books, food recipes and business law. In contrast, the earliest Sumerian script, like modern mathematical symbols and musical notation, are partial scripts. You can use mathematical script to make calculations, but you cannot use it to write love poems.

20. Despite its proclamation of the equality of all men, the imagined order established by the Americans in 1776 also established a hierarchy. It created a hierarchy between men, who benefited from it, and women, whom it left disempowered. It created a hierarchy between whites, who enjoyed liberty, and blacks and American Indians, who were considered humans of a lesser type and therefore did not share in the equal rights of men. Many of those who signed the Declaration of Independence were slaveholders. They did not release their slaves upon signing the Declaration, nor did they consider themselves hypocrites. In their view, the rights of men had little to do with Negroes.

21. AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION, human societies grew ever larger and more complex, while the imagined constructs sustaining the social order also became more elaborate. Myths and fictions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called culture’.

22. Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable environment cannot avoid change. Unlike the laws of physics, which are free of inconsistencies, every man-made order is packed with internal contradictions. Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions, and this process fuels change. For instance, in medieval Europe the nobility believed in both Christianity and chivalry. A typical nobleman went to church in the morning, and listened as the priest held forth on the lives of the saints. ‘Vanity of vanities,’ said the priest, ‘all is vanity. Riches, lust and honour are dangerous temptations. You must rise above them, and follow in Christ’s footsteps. Be meek like Him, avoid violence and extravagance, and if attacked – just turn the other cheek.’ Returning home in a meek and pensive mood, the nobleman would change into his best silks and go to a banquet in his lord’s castle. There the wine flowed like water, the minstrel sang of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the guests exchanged dirty jokes and bloody war tales. ‘It is better to die,’ declared the barons, ‘than to live with shame. If someone questions your honour, only blood can wipe out the insult. And what is better in life than to see your enemies flee before you, and their pretty daughters tremble at your feet?’

23. Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality. The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.

24. We begin with the story of the greatest conqueror in history, a conqueror possessed of extreme tolerance and adaptability, thereby turning people into ardent disciples. This conqueror is money. People who do not believe in the same god or obey the same king are more than willing to use the same money. Osama Bin Laden, for all his hatred of American culture, American religion and American politics, was very fond of American dollars. How did money succeed where gods and kings failed?

27. Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability. Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This involves two distinct criteria: 1. Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of human whims or agreements. Professional football is not a religion, because despite its many laws, rites and often bizarre rituals, everyone knows that human beings invented football themselves, and FIFA may at any moment enlarge the size of the goal or cancel the offside rule. 2. Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it considers binding. Many Westerners today believe in ghosts, fairies and reincarnation, but these beliefs are not a source of moral and behavioural standards. As such, they do not constitute a religion.

28. Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks. In classical Greek polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and their colleagues were subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate (Moira, Ananke). Nordic gods, too, were in thrall to fate, which doomed them to perish in the cataclysm of Ragnarök (the Twilight of the Gods). In the polytheistic religion of the Yoruba of West Africa, all gods were born of the supreme god Olodumare, and remained subject to him. In Hindu polytheism, a single principle, Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirits, humankind, and the biological and physical world. Atman is the eternal essence or soul of the entire universe, as well as of every individual and every phenomenon. The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans. It’s pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health or for rain, because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no difference whether a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether a particular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman.

29. In the 300 years from the crucifixion of Christ to the conversion of Emperor Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no more than four general persecutions of Christians. Local administrators and governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.1 In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion. The religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved accepted Christ’s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God’s greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven depends upon his or her own good deeds magnifies his own importance, and implies that Christ’s suffering on the cross and God’s love for humankind are not enough. These theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds of thousands. On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God’s love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours.

30. Polytheism continued to give birth here and there to other monotheist religions, but they remained marginal, not least because they failed to digest their own universal message. Judaism, for example, argued that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, yet His chief interest is in the tiny Jewish nation and in the obscure land of Israel. Judaism had little to offer other nations, and throughout most of its existence it has not been a missionary religion. This stage can be called the stage of ‘local monotheism’.

31. The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.

32. So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.

33. Dualistic religions flourished for more than a thousand years. Sometime between 1500 BC and 1000 BC a prophet named Zoroaster (Zarathustra) was active somewhere in Central Asia. His creed passed from generation to generation until it became the most important of dualistic religions – Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians saw the world as a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god Angra Mainyu. Humans had to help the good god in this battle. Zoroastrianism was an important religion during the Achaemenid Persian Empire (550–330 BC) and later became the official religion of the Sassanid Persian Empire (AD 224–651). It exerted a major influence on almost all subsequent Middle Eastern and Central Asian religions, and it inspired a number of other dualist religions, such as Gnosticism and Manichaeanism. During the third and fourth centuries AD, the Manichaean creed spread from China to North Africa, and for a moment it appeared that it would beat Christianity to achieve dominance in the Roman Empire. Yet the Manichaeans lost the soul of Rome to the Christians, the Zoroastrian Sassanid Empire was overrun by the monotheistic Muslims, and the dualist wave subsided. Today only a handful of dualist communities survive in India and the Middle East. Nevertheless, the rising tide of monotheism did not really wipe out dualism. Jewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous dualist beliefs and practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what we call ‘monotheism’ are, in fact, dualist in origin and spirit. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in a powerful evil force – like the one Christians call the Devil or Satan – who can act independently, fight against the good God, and wreak havoc without God’s permission. How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is impossible. Either you believe in a single omnipotent God or you believe in two opposing powers, neither of which is omnipotent. Still, humans have a wonderful capacity to believe in contradictions. So it should not come as a surprise that millions of pious Christians, Muslims and Jews manage to believe at one and the same time in an omnipotent God and an independent Devil. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews have gone so far as to imagine that the good God even needs our help in its struggle against the Devil, which inspired among other things the call for jihads and crusades.

34. In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from different sources. It’s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.

35. the religious history of the world does not boil down to the history of gods. During the first millennium BC, religions of an altogether new kind began to spread through Afro-Asia. The newcomers, such as Jainism and Buddhism in India, Daoism and Confucianism in China, and Stoicism, Cynicism and Epicureanism in the Mediterranean basin, were characterised by their disregard of gods. These creeds maintained that the superhuman order governing the world is the product of natural laws rather than of divine wills and whims. Some of these natural-law religions continued to espouse the existence of gods, but their gods were subject to the laws of nature no less than humans, animals and plants were.

36. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama himself attained nirvana and was fully liberated from suffering. Henceforth he was known as ‘Buddha’, which means ‘The Enlightened One’. Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries to others so that everyone could be freed from suffering. He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is. This law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by Buddhists as a universal law of nature. That ‘suffering arises from craving’ is always and everywhere true, just as in modern physics E always equals mc2. Buddhists are people who believe in this law and make it the fulcrum of all their activities. Belief in gods, on the other hand, is of minor importance to them.

37. History cannot be explained deterministically and it cannot be predicted because it is chaotic. So many forces are at work and their interactions are so complex that extremely small variations in the strength of the forces and the way they interact produce huge differences in outcomes. Not only that, but history is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system. Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system.

38. Politics, too, is a second-order chaotic system. Many people criticise Sovietologists for failing to predict the 1989 revolutions and castigate Middle East experts for not anticipating the Arab Spring revolutions of 2011. This is unfair. Revolutions are, by definition, unpredictable. A predictable revolution never erupts. Why not? Imagine that it’s 2010 and some genius political scientists in cahoots with a computer wizard have developed an infallible algorithm that, incorporated into an attractive interface, can be marketed as a revolution predictor. They offer their services to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and, in return for a generous down payment, tell Mubarak that according to their forecasts a revolution would certainly break out in Egypt during the course of the following year. How would Mubarak react? Most likely, he would immediately lower taxes, distribute billions of dollars in handouts to the citizenry – and also beef up his secret police force, just in case. The pre-emptive measures work. The year comes and goes and, surprise, there is no revolution. Mubarak demands his money back. ‘Your algorithm is worthless!’ he shouts at the scientists. ‘In the end I could have built another palace instead of giving all that money away!’ ‘But the reason the revolution didn’t happen is because we predicted it,’ the scientists say in their defence. ‘Prophets who predict things that don’t happen?’ Mubarak remarks as he motions his guards to grab them. ‘I could have picked up a dozen of those for next to nothing in the Cairo marketplace.’

39. modern science differs from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways: a. The willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge. b. The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories. c. The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies. The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.

40. In 1620 Francis Bacon published a scientific manifesto tided The New Instrument. In it he argued that ‘knowledge is power’. The real test of ‘knowledge’ is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us. Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge.

41. Science is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining what to do with its discoveries.
   - Location: 4153-4154
   - Page: 271

42. In short, scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justifies the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology influences the scientific agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries. Hence in order to comprehend how humankind has reached Alamogordo and the moon – rather than any number of alternative destinations – it is not enough to survey the achievements of physicists, biologists and sociologists. We have to take into account the ideological, political and economic forces that shaped physics, biology and sociology, pushing them in certain directions while neglecting others. Two forces in particular deserve our attention: imperialism and capitalism. The feedback loop between science, empire and capital has arguably been history’s chief engine for the past 500 years.

43. While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth. The colony was threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York. The remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and British are today paved over by the world’s most famous street – Wall Street.

44. As in previous eras, there is today a division of labour between the elite and the masses. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every penny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing their assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt buying cars and televisions they don’t really need.

46. During World War Two, BBC News was broadcast to Nazi-occupied Europe. Each news programme opened with a live broadcast of Big Ben tolling the hour – the magical sound of freedom. Ingenious German physicists found a way to determine the weather conditions in London based on tiny differences in the tone of the broadcast ding-dongs. This information offered invaluable help to the Luftwaffe. When the British Secret Service discovered this, they replaced the live broadcast with a set recording of the famous clock.

49. So maybe Third World discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease, corruption and political oppression but also by mere exposure to First World standards. The average Egyptian was far less likely to die from starvation, plague or violence under Hosni Mubarak than under Ramses II or Cleopatra. Never had the material condition of most Egyptians been so good. You’d think they would have been dancing in the streets in 2011, thanking Allah for their good fortune. Instead they rose up furiously to overthrow Mubarak. They weren’t comparing themselves to their ancestors under the pharaohs, but rather to their contemporaries in Obama’s America.

50. happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in seeing one’s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. There is an important cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the difference to whether we see ourselves as ‘miserable slaves to a baby dictator’ or as ‘lovingly nurturing a new life’.2 As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.

## Systematic
**Author:** James R. Valcourt

### Highlights (21)

1. deconstructing systems into their constituent components has taught us much of what we know about biology today. But we now also have the capability to start putting those pieces back together to understand how they make life work. That’s systems biology.

2. While scientists can build systems that maintain the blood sugar balance, it is difficult to get those machines to perform as well as the body’s own system. The first reason this is difficult is common to both artificial pumps and to the body’s normal insulin delivery system: insulin acts relatively slowly—the insulin the pump releases now won’t be felt for several minutes. That delay makes it difficult to keep the system stable—it’s like trying to guide a car through a high-speed obstacle course by passing notes to the driver from the backseat. In other ways, a human-designed insulin pump actually faces even more challenges than the beta cells do in a healthy person. While the body can ramp up insulin release in anticipation of a big meal—for example, the parasympathetic nervous system can trigger insulin release in response to the taste of food5—a pump that’s just watching the patient’s blood glucose level can’t respond until it sees the sugar actually hit the bloodstream.6 Even if the pump could predict glucose spikes before they happen, dosing insulin preemptively could be risky: if the pump overestimates the need for insulin, blood glucose levels will crash, which is a much more immediately dangerous situation than having too much glucose.

3. In their efforts to understand the cell, modern researchers have access to more tools and types of global information about the cell than ever before. Besides looking at all of the cell’s DNA and RNA, scientists can now, with varying degrees of ease and accuracy, measure vast numbers of proteins, metabolic molecules, and chemical modifications of DNA and proteins. These other types of data can help paint an even more complete picture of what’s happening in the cell if used correctly. But more data does not always lead directly to more understanding. To paraphrase an analogy used by Nathan Kutz, a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Washington,30 today’s scientists—many of whom try to wrangle meaning from large amounts of data—often end up with an answer that resembles the work of the German astronomer Johannes Kepler.
   - Location: 1135-1142
   - Page: 75

4. Much like Kepler, scientists today have plenty of data. We can find patterns in the data, and in many cases, we can describe the behaviors we see quite well. The challenge is then to take all of those measurements and use them to infer the underlying systems that govern cellular behavior—to stop describing orbits and start building rockets.

5. Human DNA is organized into big chunks called chromosomes, and a person’s sex is determined by how many of two special types of chromosomes he or she has. If an embryo gets one copy of the chromosome we call X and one copy of the Y chromosome, it will develop as a male, and if it gets two X chromosomes, it will develop as a female. That sounds straightforward, but having an extra copy of a chromosome isn’t usually something to be taken lightly. People who are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21 develop Down syndrome. Fetuses that have an extra copy of most other chromosomes usually don’t even survive to birth. But a person with an extra copy of the X chromosome … is a woman. Not only is having two copies of the X chromosome not deleterious, it’s a normal part of life for half of the population. How can that be? It turns out that each of a woman’s cells has one copy of the X chromosome wrapped up into a little ball of DNA, often called a Barr body. When it’s packed up in this way, the cell generally can’t make proteins using the balled up chromosome, so females end up with one functional X chromosome per cell, just like males. If it were active, that X chromosome would cause chaos, but by wrapping up the extra X, females are able to inactivate the genes on that chromosome. Interestingly, the decision of which X chromosome to inactivate seems to be more or less random, so women actually are mosaics of cells: some of their cells express one copy of the X chromosome and the rest express the other. This is how calico cats get their patchy patterning: some of the cat’s cells express a gene on one of their X chromosomes that leads to one color, and the other cells express the copy of that gene from the other X chromosome. That’s why almost all calico cats are female1—male cats have only one X chromosome, so they express it in all of their cells. Even people can be patchy: the mosaic pattern is particularly obvious in women with a mutation in one of the genes on the X chromosome that helps with the development of sweat glands. In that case, the woman will have some patches of skin that sweat and some that don’t.

6. Water fleas have about 31,000 genes. Rice has 51,000 genes. The organism that causes the sexually transmitted infection trichomoniasis has 60,000 genes.5 And yet humans have only a little more than 20,000 genes—even fewer than a water flea has.
   - Location: 1182-1185
   - Page: 78

7. And RNAs play many other roles in the cell, too. Besides serving as a template for proteins and helping to degrade other RNAs, they shuttle the building blocks of proteins around the cell. They are a huge part of the cell’s protein-making machine, the ribosome. Some can speed up chemical reactions, and some provide a structural backbone for cellular machines. RNAs are so versatile that some scientists even speculate that life may have started out as self-replicating RNA molecules that eventually evolved to include DNA and proteins—and into all life as we know it today.
   - Location: 1226-1230
   - Page: 80

8. Even though humans have only 20,000 genes, our cells can actually produce multiple versions of a protein from a single gene. When the cell starts the process of turning on a gene by making an initial RNA copy of it, that copy includes regulatory sequences in addition to the sequences that serve as a template for the protein. Those regulatory regions contain sequences that help decide how the RNA is processed and how quickly that template will be degraded—both of which can affect how and when a protein is made from that RNA. In order to make a protein, the cell has to process the initial RNA copy of the gene by cutting and pasting the right pieces together to form a final template in a process called splicing. For some genes, there’s only one way to put the pieces together; for others, there are dozens of possible final templates. Alternative splicing allows a single gene to make many versions of a protein with many different functions. One example of alternative splicing takes place in a fruit fly gene called doublesex. This gene creates proteins that are partially responsible for determining the fly’s sex; one version of the protein turns the fly into a male, and the other turns it into a female. The segments of the RNA that serve as a template for the protein are called exons, and the cell includes or leaves out exons in order to create one of two different possible tails for the protein. If exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 are included, the resulting protein turns the fly into a female, whereas exons 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 together make the male-promoting protein.13

9. there are many other important interactions in a cell that aren’t necessarily directly reflected in gene expression changes, at least not immediately. Take the modifications that many proteins undergo, for example. Proteins can be chemically modified by attaching small molecules or other small proteins to them. These modifications are endless: proteins can be phosphorylated, acetylated, carbonylated, sumoylated, ubiquitinated, palmitoylated, glycosylated, phosphopantetheinylated, and more. Each of these modifications is used to change the protein’s behavior or to signal to other parts of the cell.
   - Location: 1248-1252
   - Page: 82

10. Probably the most famous type of modification is phosphorylation, which involves the addition of one phosphorous and three oxygen atoms to a protein. Phosphorylation can affect the protein’s shape and thereby change how it interacts with other proteins, and many proteins can be phosphorylated in multiple places. The anti-cancer protein p53, which is activated by DNA damage and other stresses, can be phosphorylated in at least 22 different places16—which means the protein could theoretically have over 4 million distinct phosphorylation patterns. And in addition to phosphorylation, p53 is known to undergo at least 8 other types of modification on at least 38 different parts of the protein.17 All of those modifications help determine which of its many helper proteins p53 attaches to and which actions it takes.
   - Location: 1252-1259
   - Page: 82

11. Protein modifications can even be used as sensors of environmental conditions; for example, the protein hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) seems to use one modification to sense how much oxygen is available to the cell.20 HIF-1α is modified by a protein called prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) that consumes oxygen in order to attach a pair of atoms—an oxygen and a hydrogen—to HIF-1α. When there’s plenty of oxygen around, this modification happens easily, and the modified HIF-1α is tagged with ubiquitin and recycled. But if oxygen is in short supply, the modification of HIF-1α; cannot proceed—which means the unmodified HIF-1α is not broken down, and it is free to turn on genes that can help the cell cope with an oxygen deficit.

12. translates those simple instructions into machine code. The ability to design software at a high level has led to the computer revolution—and a similar revolution would be really useful in biological machines. Bacteria and other organisms don’t speak in ones and zeros, but they have another low-level language that is hard for humans to think in: the language of DNA. As much as it is tedious and time-consuming to write computer instructions in machine code, it’s arguably much worse to write in the genetic code. While we fully understand how computer chips work—after all, we designed them—our grasp on how gene expression is regulated is still a work in progress. One early attempt at helping humans “speak DNA” was Biocompiler,4 the brainchild of Dr. Jacob Beal and Dr. Ron Weiss at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their idea, shared by some other scientists, was that one day you will be able to write a program that is then automatically translated into the genetic code necessary to produce the system you designed.

This worked because those cases of dementia were caused by rampant syphilis attacking the brain; the malaria infection got the patient to run a fever, which improved the syphilis.9 The “treatment” killed 15% of the patients who received it, but late-stage syphilis was almost always fatal. The best part? Penicillin was discovered one year later, in 1928. (Though it didn’t become practical to mass-produce until the 1940s, when production was increased in preparation to treat the huge number of Allied casualties expected on D-Day.)

16. Marder sums it up this way: “All healthy brains probably follow the same rules, but all healthy brains are going to be individually different.” And while that’s an exciting notion, it also makes studying the brain that much more difficult: it reinforces the notion that the properties we care about come from many neurons working together rather than the details of any one specific neuron.

17. However, there’s one important system that few people know about, a system that accounts for about half of the cells that actually make up the body. It’s the part of the human body that isn’t human. A typical adult person is composed of about 40 trillion cells, but he or she is host to at least that many microbes living on and in the body.6 These microbes are mostly bacteria, but there are also plenty of less-familiar single-celled organisms. All told, these microbes make up about three or four pounds of a typical person’s weight. Most of them live in the colon and digestive tract, though they also inhabit the skin, ear canal, lungs, and any other space where they can find a hospitable environment. These creatures are constantly growing and living and fighting and dying within us, and most of us have no idea.

18. These days, we know a lot more about cancer. It is a really difficult disease to treat because cancer is actually hundreds of different diseases. As mentioned previously, a tumor is actually just a group of cells that keep on growing when they shouldn’t, and there are a lot of ways for that to happen. The body has many defense mechanisms set up to curb the growth of runaway cells, but when those mechanisms fail, the results are devastating. Cancer starts in one location and can invade others, disrupting vital organs and ultimately killing the patient. Beating cancer is about more than just treating the tumor itself. In fact, the tumor and its environment interact in complicated ways that make it important to think about the tumor and the surrounding tissue as a connected system. In our early screens for cancer drugs, we often looked at cancer cells by themselves. Unfortunately, cancer cells behave rather differently in their “natural” environment from when they are alone in a dish. In fact, sometimes the surrounding cells actually help to protect the cancer cells from our drugs.

19. 2For our purposes, “network” and “system” are essentially synonyms, but many scientists might draw a distinction: a network is any group of components that are connected in a defined way; a system can be thought of as a type of network where the pieces work together to perform some task or produce some coherent behavior. One might also choose the word “network” over “system” when the connections between components aren’t very “real”—for example, a friendship between two people might belong in a network, but perhaps not in a system.

## Ten Types of Innovation

### Highlights (13)

   - Location: 169-170
   - Page: 11

2. Our use of sticky notes and black Sharpie markers has become almost fetishistic,1 one of the many rituals in our collective cult of innovation. Here’s the problem—evidence shows that such techniques do not actually lead to better outcomes. A number of years ago, we researched innovation efforts in industries such as manufacturing and services. A full 95% of these efforts failed.

   - Page: 13

3. 1 Innovation Is not Invention Innovation may involve invention, but it requires many other things as well—including a deep understanding of whether customers need or desire that invention, how you can work with other partners to deliver it, and how it will pay for itself over time.
   - Location: 234-236
   - Page: 16

4. 3 Very Little Is Truly New in Innovation Biologist Francesco Redi established the maxim: “Every living thing comes from a living thing.” Too often, we fail to appreciate that most innovations are based on previous advances. Innovations don’t have to be new to the world—only to a market or industry.3

6. 1 Knowing Where to Innovate Is as Important as Knowing How to Innovate Striking oil or mining lithium depends far more on knowing where to dig than on the digging itself. Identify the right innovation opportunities and be very clear about the nature of the innovation you intend to create before you begin a project.
   - Location: 250-253
   - Page: 17

7. 2 Tackle the Hardest Problems First Don’t look for low-hanging fruit. Instead, target big, gnarly problems with no easy answer. This isn’t about what’s easy for you; it’s about solving deep problems for your customers. When innovating, focus on the hardest parts of a concept you have to get right. The easy stuff can wait until later.

   - Page: 17

8. It Doesn’t Count until It’s in the Market You haven’t finished the process of innovating until you bring the offering to market and you’re getting revenue for it. Or, for social or government contexts, you have helped your stakeholders in a new and better way that can sustain itself over time.
   - Location: 260-262
   - Page: 17

9. Turn Complexity into Simplicity It’s easy to take something simple and make it complex: politicians and lawyers seem to do it for a living. Yet very few innovations are championed for their intricacy. Most are known for bringing elegance and simplicity to even the thorniest problems.
   - Location: 263-265

10. Innovation is a team sport. In fact, an organization that depends on individual innovators alone is destined to fail. Understanding how you can wire innovation into your organization—and build a robust internal innovation capability—is an imperative for any firm doing business in today’s dynamic world.

11. Profit Model How You Make Money Innovative profit models find a fresh way to convert a firm’s offerings and other sources of value into cash. Great ones reflect a deep understanding of what customers and users actually cherish and where new revenue or pricing opportunities might lie. Innovative profit models often challenge an industry’s tired old assumptions about what to offer, what to charge, or how to collect revenues. This is a big part of their power: in most industries the dominant profit model often goes unquestioned for decades. Common examples of profit model innovations include premium prices, where companies figure out how to charge more for their offering than competitors do, or auctions, where the market sets the price for goods. The ideal profit model will vary widely by context and industry. A new entrant may design its profit model to make it easy for customers to try and adopt its products (say, metered use), while the incumbent may counter with models that make it difficult for existing customers to switch (say, subscriptions). One constant: to succeed, profit models—perhaps more than any other type of innovation—must align with a company’s overarching strategy and innovation intent.

12. The “razor and blades” profit model has been celebrated for years and adapted to countless other industries, from printers and cartridges to capsule coffee. The gist is simple—create an installed base by selling the enduring part of the system at low cost (or even a loss), and then enjoy recurring revenue by selling the disposable parts at a premium.

13. Target was designed to “combine the best of the fashion world with the best of the discount world, a quality store with quality merchandise at discount prices.” From the beginning, the stores were intended to be fun and welcoming for the whole family, with easy-to-shop displays. In 1999, Target partnered with architect Michael Graves, who created an exclusive line of kitchen appliances for the store. Since then, the company has worked with more than 75 product designers and more than a dozen world-renowned fashion designers to create items that are only available at Target, burnishing the reputation and reach of both parties. Later, Target expanded its network innovation to include partnerships with other retailers, such as Liberty of London, building pop-up shops that are only open for a short period of time. It’s a deliberate strategy to create buzz, attention, and sales—and it’s one that has had an impact on the bottom line. The company reported that a five-year collaboration with designer Isaac Mizrahi generated $300 million a year in profits, while a line of handbags designed by Anya Hindmarch sold out online within two minutes. These Network innovations have helped Target not only survive but thrive—despite intense competition from other big box retailers.

2. Cancer genes are broadly grouped into oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Using a classical analogy, oncogenes can be compared to a car accelerator, so that a mutation in an oncogene would be the equivalent of having the accelerator continuously pressed.2 Tumor suppressor genes, in contrast, act as brakes,2 so that when they are not mutated, they function to inhibit tumorigenesis.

3. Major types of somatic mutations present in malignant tumors include nucleotide substitutions, small insertions and deletions (indels), chromosomal rearrangements, and copy number alterations.

4. Project was released in 2004,3 and provided a sequence-based map of the normal human genome. This information, together with the construction of the HapMap, which contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), and the underlying genomic structure of natural human genomic variation,6,7 allowed an extraordinary throughput in cataloging somatic mutations in cancer.
   - Location: 470-475

5. Although most cancer genome studies of large gene families have focused on the kinome, recent analyses have revealed that members of other families highly represented in the human genome are also a target of mutational events in cancer. This is the case of proteases, a complex group of enzymes consisting of at least 569 components that constitute the so-called human degradome.

6. The next step forward in the mutational profiling of cancer has been the sequencing of exomes, which is the entire coding portion of the human genome (18,000 protein-encoding genes). The exomes of many different tumors—including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian clear cell carcinomas; glioblastoma multiforme; and medulloblastoma—have been analyzed using Sanger sequencing.

Although the alterations included point mutations, small insertions, deletions, or amplifications, the great majority of the mutations observed were single-base substitutions.45,46   Even within a single cancer type, there is a significant intertumor heterogeneity. This means that multiple mutational patterns (encompassing different mutant genes) are present in tumors that cannot be distinguished based on histologic analysis. The concept that individual tumors have a unique genetic milieu is highly relevant for personalized medicine, a concept that will be further discussed.

13. The number of next-generation sequencing platforms has substantially grown over the past few years and currently includes technologies from Roche/454, Illumina/Solexa, Life/APG’s SOLiD3, Helicos BioSciences/HeliScope, and Pacific Biosciences/PacBio RS.61 Noteworthy also are the recent introduction of the Polonator G.007 instrument, an open source platform with freely available software and protocols; the Ion Torrent’s semiconductor sequencer; as well as those involving self-assembling DNA nanoballs or nanopore technologies.65–67 These new machines are driving the field toward the era of third-generation sequencing, which brings enormous clinical interest because it can substantially increase the speed and accuracy of analyses at reduced costs and can facilitate the possibility of single-molecule sequencing of human genomes.

15. Another important aspect that the comprehensive nature of this melanoma study provided was that cancer mutations are spread out unevenly throughout the genome, with a lower prevalence in regions of transcribed genes, suggesting that DNA repair occurs mainly in these areas.

16. Whole-genome sequencing of cancer genomes has an enormous potential to detect all major types of somatic mutations present in malignant tumors. This large repertoire of genomic abnormalities includes single nucleotide changes, small insertions and deletions, large chromosomal reorganizations, and copy number variations
   - Location: 815-817
   - Page: 54

17. Small insertions and deletions (indels) represent a second category of somatic mutations that can be discovered by whole-genome sequencing of cancer specimens. These mutations are about 10-fold less frequent than nucleotide substitutions, but may also have an obvious impact in cancer progression. Accordingly, specific bioinformatic tools have been created to detect these indels in the context of the large amount of information generated by whole-genome sequencing projects.
   - Location: 846-849

18. Genomewide mutational analyses suggest that the mutational landscape of cancer is made up of a handful of genes that are mutated in a high fraction of tumors, otherwise known as mountains, and most mutated genes are altered at relatively low frequencies, otherwise known as hills (Fig. 1.7).29 The mountains probably give a high selective advantage to the mutated cell, and the hills might provide a lower advantage, making it hard to distinguish them from passenger mutations.
   - Location: 875-880
   - Page: 58

19. By the time a cancer is diagnosed, it is comprised of billions of cells carrying DNA abnormalities, some of which have a functional role in malignant proliferation; however, many genetic lesions acquired along the way have no functional role in tumorigenesis.14 The emerging landscapes of cancer genomes include thousands of genes that were not previously linked to tumorigenesis but are found to be somatically mutated. Many of these changes are likely to be passengers, or neutral, in that they have no functional effects on the growth of the tumor.14 Only a small fraction of the genetic alterations are expected to drive cancer evolution by giving cells a selective advantage over their neighbors. Passenger mutations occur incidentally in a cell that later or in parallel develops a driver mutation, but are not ultimately pathogenic.
   - Location: 911-918
   - Page: 60

20. The most reliable indicator that a gene was selected for and therefore is highly likely to be pathogenic is the identification of recurrent mutations, whether at the same exact amino acid position or in neighboring amino acid positions in different patients. More than that, if somatic alterations in the same gene occur very frequently (mountains in the tumor genome landscape), these can be confidently classified as drivers. For example, cancer alleles that are identified in multiple patients and different tumors types, such as those found in KRAS, TP53, PTEN, and PIK3CA, are clearly selected for during tumorigenesis.
   - Location: 924-929
   - Page: 61

21. Another approach often used to distinguish driver from passenger mutations exploits the statistical analysis of synonymous versus nonsynonymous changes.
   - Location: 939-940
   - Page: 62

22. The repertoire of oncogenic mutations is extremely heterogeneous, suggesting that it would be difficult for independent cancer genome initiatives to address the generation of comprehensive catalogs of mutations in the wide spectrum of human malignancies. Accordingly, there have been different efforts to coordinate the cancer genome sequencing projects being carried out around the world, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC).

23. Cancer genomics has dramatically impacted disease management, because its application is helping researchers determine which patients are likely to benefit from which drug. As discussed in great detail in Chapter 22, good examples for such treatment include targeted therapy using imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and the use of gefitinib and erlotinib for NSCLC patients.

24. The hallmarks of cancer comprise eight biologic capabilities acquired by incipient cancer cells during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis, reprogramming energy metabolism, and evading immune destruction. Facilitating the acquisition of these hallmark capabilities are genome instability, which enables mutational alteration of hallmark-enabling genes, and immune inflammation, which fosters the acquisition of multiple hallmark functions.

Facilitating the acquisition of these hallmark capabilities are genome instability, which enables mutational alteration of hallmark-enabling genes, and immune inflammation, which fosters the acquisition of multiple hallmark functions. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: They contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the tumor microenvironment. Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly influence the development of new means to treat human cancer.

26. The role of defective immunologic monitoring of tumors would seem to be validated by the striking increases of certain cancers in immune-compromised individuals.173 However, the great majority of these are virus-induced cancers, suggesting that much of the control of this class of cancers normally depends on reducing viral burden in infected individuals, in part through eliminating virus-infected cells.
   - Location: 2219-2222
   - Page: 145

27. In recent years, however, an increasing body of evidence, both from genetically engineered mice and from clinical epidemiology, suggests that the immune system operates as a significant barrier to tumor formation and progression, at least in some forms of non–virus-induced cancer.
   - Location: 2223-2225
   - Page: 145

28. Highly immunogenic cancer cell clones are routinely eliminated in immunocompetent hosts—a process that has been referred to as immunoediting—leaving behind only weakly immunogenic variants to grow and generate solid tumors. Such weakly immunogenic cells can thereafter successfully colonize both immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts. Conversely, when arising in immunodeficient hosts, the immunogenic cancer cells are not selectively depleted and can, instead, prosper along with their weakly immunogenic counterparts. When cells from such nonedited tumors are serially transplanted into syngeneic recipients, the immunogenic cancer cells are rejected when they confront, for the first time, the competent immune systems of their secondary hosts.
   - Location: 2239-2244
   - Page: 147

29. We have defined the hallmarks of cancer as acquired functional capabilities that allow cancer cells to survive, proliferate, and disseminate. Their acquisition is made possible by two enabling characteristics (Fig. 2.2). Most prominent is the development of genomic instability in cancer cells, which generates random mutations, including chromosomal rearrangements, among which are rare genetic changes that can orchestrate individual hallmark capabilities. A second enabling characteristic involves the inflammatory state of premalignant and frankly malignant lesions. A variety of cells of the innate and adaptive immune system infiltrate neoplasias, some of which serve to promote tumor progression through various means.

30. The extraordinary ability of genome maintenance systems to detect and resolve defects in the DNA ensures that rates of spontaneous mutation in normal cells of the body are typically very low, both in quiescent cells and during cell division. The genomes of most cancer cells, by contrast, are replete with these alterations, reflecting loss of genomic integrity with concomitantly increased rates of mutation. This heightened mutability appears to accelerate the generation of variant cells, facilitating the selection of those cells whose advantageous phenotypes enable their clonal expansion.

31. Molecular diagnostics is increasingly impacting a number of areas of cancer care delivery including diagnosis, prognosis, in predicting response to particular therapies, and in minimal residual disease monitoring. Each of these depends on detection or measurement of one or more disease-specific molecular biomarkers representing abnormalities in genetic or epigenetic pathways controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, or cell death (Table 3.1). In addition, molecular diagnostics is beginning to play a role in predicting host metabolism of drugs—for example, in predicting fast versus slow thiopurine metabolizers using polymorphisms in the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) allele and in use in dosing patients with thiopurine drugs.
   - Location: 3203-3209
   - Page: 209

32. The ideal cancer biomarker is only associated with the disease and not the normal state. The utility of the biomarker largely depends on what the clinical effect the biomarker predicts for, how large the effect is, and how strong the evidence is for the effect. For clinical application, biomarkers need a high level of analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. Analytic validity refers to the ability of the overall testing process to accurately detect and, in many cases, measure the biomarker. Clinical validity is the ability of a biomarker to predict a particular disease behavior or response to therapy. Clinical utility, arguably the most difficult to assess, addresses whether the information available from the biomarker is actually beneficial for patient care.
   - Location: 3213-3218
   - Page: 210

33. Biomarkers can take many forms including chromosomal translocations and other chromosomal rearrangements, gene amplification, copy number variation, point mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, changes in gene expression (including micro RNAs), and epigenetic alterations. Most biomarkers in widespread use represent either gain of function or loss of function alterations in key signaling pathways. Those that occur early and at a high frequency in tumors tend to be driver mutations, whose function is important for the cancer cell’s proliferation and/or survival. These are particularly useful as biomarkers because they often represent important therapeutic targets. However, cancer cells accumulate many genetic alterations, called passenger mutations, which tend to occur at a lower frequency overall and in a subset of a heterogeneous population of tumor cells that may contribute to the cancer phenotype but are not absolutely essential.2 Distinguishing passenger from driver mutations using various functional assays has become a major focus of translational research in cancer.

34. Copy number variation (CNV) represents the most common type of structural chromosomal alteration. Regions affected by CNVs range from approximately 1 kilobase to several megabases that are either amplified or deleted. It is estimated that about 0.4% of the genomes of healthy individuals differ in copy number.8 CNVs resulting in deletion of genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, mismatch repair genes, and TP53 have been implicated in a wide range of highly penetrant cancers.
   - Location: 3266-3270
   - Page: 213

35. Formally, the term polymorphism is used to describe genetic differences present in ≥1% of the human population, whereas mutation describes less frequent differences. However, in practice, polymorphism is often used to describe a nonpathogenic genetic change, and mutation a deleterious change, regardless of their frequencies.

36. Mutations can be classified according to their effect in the structure of a gene. The most common of these disease-associated alterations are single nucleotide substitutions (point mutations); however, many deletions, insertions, gene rearrangements, gene amplification, and copy number variations have been identified that have clinical significance. Point mutations may affect promoters, splicing sites, or coding regions. Coding region mutations can be classified into three kinds, depending on the impact on the codon: missense mutation, a nucleotide change leads to the substitution of an amino acid to another; nonsense mutation, a nucleotide substitution causes premature termination of codons with protein truncation; and silent mutation, a nucleotide change does not change the coded amino acid.

Loss of function mutations, either through point mutations or deletions in tumor suppression genes such as APC and TP53, are the most common mutations in cancers. Tumor suppression genes require two-hit (biallelic) mutations that inactivate both copies of the gene in order to allow tumorigenesis to occur. The first hit is usually an inherited or somatic point mutation, and the second hit is assumed to be an acquired deletion mutation that deletes the second copy of the tumor suppression gene.

38. Samples typically received for molecular oncology testing include blood, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, fluids, organ-specific fresh tissues in saline or tissue culture media such as Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI), FFPE tissues, and cytology cell blocks. Molecular tests can be ordered electronically or through written requisition forms, but never through verbal requests only. All samples submitted for molecular testing need to be appropriately identified. Sample type, quantity, and specimen handling and transport requirements should conform to the laboratory’s stated requirements in order to ensure valid test results. Blood and bone marrow samples should be drawn into anticoagulated tubes. The preferred anticoagulant for most molecular assays is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; lavender). Other acceptable collection tubes include ACD (yellow) solutions A and B. Heparinized tubes are not preferred for most molecular tests because heparin inhibits the polymerase enzyme utilized in PCR, which may lead to assay failure. Blood and bone marrow samples can be transported at ambient temperature. Blood samples should never be frozen prior to separation of cellular elements because this causes hemolysis, which interferes with DNA amplification. Fluids should be transported on ice. Tissues should be frozen (preferred method) as soon as possible and sent on dry ice to minimize degradation. Fresh tissues in RPMI should be sent on ice or cold packs. Cells should be kept frozen and sent on dry ice; DNA samples can be sent at ambient temperature or on ice.

39. The workflow of a molecular test begins with receipt and accessioning of the specimen in the clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory followed by extraction of the nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), test setup, detection of analyte (e.g., PCR products), data analysis, and result reporting to the patient medical record
   - Location: 3351-3353
   - Page: 219

40. Fresh and frozen tissues also undergo proteinase K digestion prior to nucleic acid extraction. DNA isolation protocols consist of several steps, including cell lysis, DNA purification by salting out the proteins and other debris (nonorganic method), or by solvent extractions of the proteins with phenol and chloroform solutions (organic method). The DNA is then precipitated out of the solution with isopropanol or ethanol. The pellet is washed with 70% to 80% ethanol and then solubilized in buffer, such as Tris-EDTA solution. Proteinase K can be added to assist in the disruption and to prevent nonspecific degradation of the DNA. RNase is sometimes added to eliminate contaminating RNA. The DNA yield is quantitated spectrophotometrically, and the DNA sample integrity is visually checked, if necessary, on an agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining. Intact DNA appears as a high–molecular-weight single band, whereas degraded DNA is identified as a smear of variably sized fragments. After extraction, the DNA is stored at 4°C prior to use in a PCR assay, and is then stored at –70°C after completion of the assay.

41. Following nucleic acid extraction, the assay is set up according to written procedures established during validation/verification of the assay by qualified laboratory staff. Dedicated areas, equipment, and materials are designated for various stages of the test (e.g., extraction, pre-PCR and post-PCR for amplification-based assays). For each molecular oncology test, appropriated positive and negative control specimens are included to each run as a matter of routine quality assessment. A no template (blank) control, containing the complete reaction mixture except for nucleic acids, is also included in amplification-based assays to evaluate for amplicon contamination in the assay reagents that may lead to inaccurate results. The controls are processed in the same manner as patient samples to ensure that established performance characteristics are being met for each step of the assay (extraction, amplification, and detection).
   - Location: 3384-3390
   - Page: 221

42. All assay controls and overall performance of the run must be examined prior to interpretation of sample results. Following acceptance of the controls, results are electronically entered into reports. The final report is reviewed and signed by the laboratory director or a qualified designee who meets the same qualifications as the director, as defined by CLIA (see previous).

43. Several traditional and emerging techniques are currently available for mutation detection in cancer (Table 3.2). In the era of personalized medicine, molecular oncology assays are rapidly moving from a mutational analysis of single genes toward a multigene panel analysis. As the number of “actionable” mutations such as ALK, EGFR, BRAF, and others increase, the use of next-generation sequencing platforms is expected to become much more widespread. Both traditional and emerging testing approaches have advantages and disadvantages that need to be balanced before a test platform is implemented into practice.

44. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific technique that can be employed in different capacities for the detection of point mutations, small deletions, insertions and duplications, as well as gene rearrangements and clonality assessment. Limits of detection can reach 0.1% mutant allele or lower, which is important for the detection of somatic mutations in oncology because tumor specimens are usually composed of a mixture of tumor and normal cells.
   - Location: 3419-3422
   - Page: 223

45. the risk of false positives due to specimen or amplicon contamination is an important issue when using PCR-based techniques; therefore, stringent laboratory procedures, as described previously, are used to minimize contamination.
   - Location: 3425-3427
   - Page: 224

46. Sanger sequencing has the ability to detect a wide variety of nucleotide alterations in the DNA, including point mutations, deletions, insertions, and duplications. This technique is especially useful when mutations are scattered across the entire gene, when genes have not been sufficiently studied to determine mutational hot spots, or when it is relevant to determine the exact change in DNA sequence.
   - Location: 3539-3542
   - Page: 231

47. Limitations of this approach include low throughput and limited diagnostic sensitivity. In general, heterozygous mutations at allelic levels lower than 20% may be difficult to detect by Sanger sequencing.
   - Location: 3544-3545
   - Page: 232

48. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a common event in cancer that usually occurs due to deletion of a chromosome segment and results in a loss of one copy of an allele. LOH is a common occurrence in tumor suppressor genes and may contribute to tumorigenesis when the second allele is subsequently inactivated by a second “hit” due to mutation or deletion.

50. NGS can be used for the detection of single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, translocations, inversions, alternative splicing, and copy number variations given sufficient depth of genomic DNA sequence (Fig. 3.10). Technical limitations of this technique include difficulty in sequencing guanine-cytosine (GC)–rich genomic regions, and erroneous sequencing of homologous DNA regions (e.g., pseudogenes) that may confound interpretation.
   - Location: 3687-3691
   - Page: 241

51. Examples of applications of NGS in oncology include small targeted panels (3 to 50 genes) for non–small-cell lung cancers, melanomas, colon cancers, and acute myeloid leukemias.57,59–62 Larger panels (50 to 500 genes) are increasingly being utilized, particularly in both clinical trials and research.

52. Gene expression signatures of multiple cancer biomarkers are starting to be incorporated into clinical practice as an adjunct to clinical and pathologic information in diverse cancer management settings. An example of a multigene expression–based test in current use includes Oncotype DX, which is a quantitative RT-PCR–based assay that measures the expression of 21 genes in FFPE breast tumors. The test is designed to predict the potential benefit of chemotherapy and the likelihood of distant breast cancer recurrence in women with node negative or node positive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, and HER2-negative invasive breast cancer. This test has been in-corporated into current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for breast cancer management.70 Prospective trials are in progress to evaluate other multigene tests for early stage breast cancer.

53. Some of the many challenges to address will be to provide evidence-based, actionable reports that guide the oncologist to more effective therapies, to learn from the results of such testing to improve the algorithms guiding therapy, to handle the incidental findings in such testing in an ethically responsible way, and ultimately, with the drugs available, to provide sufficient improvements in outcomes so that society will be willing to bear the costs.

56. The histologic subtypes of lung cancer seen in the US population have also shifted with time. Into the early 1980s, squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) were the most common manifestations of lung cancer. However, a rapid rise in adenocarcinomas has been noted, and by the 1990s, had overtaken SCC as the leading type of lung cancer.

Viral infections are estimated to play a causal role in at least 11% of all new cancer diagnoses worldwide.1 A vast majority of cases (>85%) occur in developing countries, where poor sanitation, high rates of cocarcinogenic factors such as HIV/AIDS, and lack of access to vaccines and cancer screening all contribute to increased rates of virally induced cancers. Even in developed countries, where effective countermeasures are widely available, cancers attributable to viral infection account for at least 4% of new cases.

58. A common feature of DNA viruses that depend on host cell DNA polymerases for replication (e.g., papillomaviruses, herpesviruses, and polyomaviruses) is the expression of viral gene products that promote progression into the cell cycle. A typical mechanism of direct oncogenic effects is through the inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins, such as the guardian of the genome, p53, and retinoblastoma protein (pRB). This effectively primes the cell to express the host machinery necessary for replicating the viral DNA.

60. Inflammation is the complex biologic responses of the body to irritation, injury, or infection. The recognition of inflammation dates back to antiquity. As documented by Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a Roman of the 1st century AD, inflammation is characterized by the tissue response to injury that results in rubor (redness, due to hyperemia), tumor (swelling, caused by increased permeability of the microvasculature and leakage of protein into the interstitial space), calor (heat, associated with increased blood flow and the metabolic activity of the cellular mediators of inflammation), and dolor (pain, in part due to changes in the perivasculature and associated nerve endings). Rudolf Virchow subsequently added functio laesa (dysfunction of the organs involved) in the 1850s.

62. Interestingly, inflammation plays a role at all stages of tumor development: initiation, progression, and metastasis.2 In initiation, inflammation induces the release of a variety of cytokines and chemokines that promote the release of inflammatory cells and associated factors. This further causes oxidative damage, DNA mutations, and other changes in the tissue microenvironment, making it more conducive to cell transformation, increased survival, and proliferation. Inflammation also contributes to tissue injury, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, angiogenesis, and fibrosis in diverse target tissues.

## How Chance and Stupidity Have Changed History
**Author:** Erik Durschmied

### Highlights (1)

1. It is interesting to note that the obscene expression of ‘two-fingers’ is not in fact obscene at all, but derives from the English bowmen taunting the French by showing them their bow-fingers. If caught by the French, a bowman would have these two fingers cut off, so that he could no longer pull his string.

## What Patients Say, What Doctors Hear
**Author:** Danielle Ofri

### Highlights (7)

1. Science-fiction movies predicted that medical diagnosis would be achieved by running a handheld machine over the patient’s body. And indeed much diagnosis is made with MRIs, PET scans, and advanced CT technology. Yet the simple verbal exchange between patient and doctor remains the cornerstone of medical diagnosis. The story the patient tells the doctor constitutes the primary data that guide diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and treatment. However, the story the patient tells and the story the doctor hears are often not the same thing. The story Mr. Amadou was telling me and the story I was hearing were not identical. There were so many layers of emotion, frustration, logistics, and desperation, that it was almost as if we were in two different conversations entirely. It is a common complaint of patients. They feel their doctors don’t really listen, don’t hear what they are trying to say.
   - Location: 105-112

2. Already you can probably see the inevitable clash between doctor and patient. The patient has a story to tell and the doctor is scoping out a chief complaint. So it’s not surprising that doctors typically interrupt patients within twelve seconds.5

3. In the past few years I’ve observed that the physical exam has taken on an important role again, though as a slightly different medical tool. Now that the computer is front and center in almost every doctor-patient encounter, doctors spend the bulk of the visit staring at a screen. Not only are our eyes yanked away from the patient, but our attention is fragmented by the disjointed and niggling nature of the typical computer interface. It’s no wonder patients feel ignored by their doctors. But then the doctor and patient move to the exam table and everything changes. This is often the first moment that we can talk directly, without the impediment of technology. We are physically closer to each other, actually touching. This is an intimacy, albeit of the nonromantic type, but an intimacy nonetheless. And all intimacies have the effect of changing the dynamics of an interaction. Obviously, there is a risk of changing it for the worse, but in my experience it is almost always a change for the better. Once a doctor and patient are at the exam table, touching, talking without the computer between them, conversation of a different sort is possible. Countless times I have found that it is only during the physical exam that patients reveal what is truly on their mind. Whether it is the cough that they are reminded of now that I am listening to their lungs or the depression, eating disorder, or genital symptoms that they feel comfortable revealing once we are in a more intimate setting, there is something about touch that changes the dynamic.

4. When patients are experiencing particularly stressful life situations such as inadequate housing or unemployment, doctors’ avoidance of these issues is associated with a six-fold higher risk of nonadherence to medication. It’s often hard for doctors to comprehend that there’s much more to adherence than a patient just opening a bottle and swallowing a pill.

5. Listening has become ingrained in Radboud’s culture, and the hospital even hosted the first European Listening and Healthcare Conference. Medical care has improved and the hospital consistently ranks at the top of the ratings for health-care quality in Europe.

6. She also helps patients sort out their own stories. She is aware that a typical doctor’s visit doesn’t allow the luxury of a full hour for listening, so she helps patients shape their story into a concise three-minute narrative that they can bring to the appointment. She helps them prioritize what they need the doctor to know and what can wait for a follow-up visit.

7. Recently, the Dutch government approved an insurance code for listening—that is, doctors can include listening as a legitimate part of the medical visit, on par with procedures and tests. You might think that listening already is a sine qua non of a doctor’s visit, but because it wasn’t possible to bill for it, procedures and tests naturally took precedence. Saying that a doctor’s visit that consists entirely of talking and listening is as worthy of reimbursement as an endoscopy or MRI is a big step. This has been immensely validating for Corine, as she sees it is a cornerstone of high-quality health care. So far it’s only for listening to patients’ end-of-life concerns. “But it’s a start,” Corine says, with characteristic optimism. Soon maybe insurance companies will recognize that listening to the patient before the end of life is equally important, and can result in tangible medical benefits.

## The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human
**Author:** Jonathan Gottschall

### Highlights (15)

1. Pretend play is deadly serious fun. Every day, children enter a world where they must confront dark forces, fleeing and fighting for their lives.
   - Location: 542-543
   - Page: 36

2. Vivian Paley is a MacArthur Foundation “genius award” winner who has been writing about her experiences as a preschool and kindergarten teacher for decades. In her small masterpiece of kiddie anthropology, Boys and Girls: Superheroes in the Doll Corner, Paley describes a yearlong experiment in the psychology of gender.
   - Location: 603-605
   - Page: 40

3. Paley’s experiment culminated in her declaration of surrender to the deep structures of gender. She decided to let the girls be girls. She admits, with real self-reproach, that this wasn’t that hard for her: Paley always approved more of the girls’ relatively calm and prosocial play. It was harder to let the boys be boys, but she did. “Let the boys be robbers,” Paley concluded, “or tough guys in space. It is the natural, universal, and essential play of little boys.”
   - Location: 630-633
   - Page: 42

4. Sex differences in children’s play reflect the fact that biological evolution is slow, while cultural evolution is fast. Evolution hasn’t caught up with the rapid changes in men’s and women’s lives that have occurred mainly in the past one hundred years. Children’s play still seems to be preparing girls for lives beside the hearth and preparing boys for lives of action in the world. This is the basic division of labor—men doing the hunting and fighting and women doing most of the foraging and parenting—that has characterized human life over tens of thousands of years. Anthropologists have never found a culture where, say, women do the lion’s share of fighting or men do most of the child care.

5. The constant firing of our neurons in response to fictional stimuli strengthens and refines the neural pathways that lead to skillful navigation of life’s problems. From this point of view, we are attracted to fiction not because of an evolutionary glitch, but because fiction is, on the whole, good for us. This is because human life, especially social life, is intensely complicated and the stakes are high. Fiction allows our brains to practice reacting to the kinds of challenges that are, and always were, most crucial to our success as a species.
   - Location: 1002-1006
   - Page: 66

6. James Wallis puts it, “Human beings like stories. Our brains have a natural affinity not only for enjoying narratives and learning from them but also for creating them. In the same way that your mind sees an abstract pattern and resolves it into a face, your imagination sees a pattern of events and resolves it into a story.”
   - Location: 1471-1473
   - Page: 96

7. Conspiracy theories—feverishly creative, lovingly plotted—are in fact fictional stories that some people believe. Conspiracy theorists connect real data points and imagined data points into a coherent, emotionally satisfying version of reality. Conspiracy theories exert a powerful hold on the human imagination—yes, perhaps even your imagination—not despite structural parallels with fiction, but in large part because of them. They fascinate us because they are ripping good yarns, showcasing classic problem structure and sharply defined good guys and villains. They offer vivid, lurid plots that translate with telling ease into wildly popular entertainment.
   - Location: 1554-1559
   - Page: 102

8. David Aaronovitch explains in his book Voodoo Histories,   Conspiracy theories originate and are largely circulated among the educated and middle class. The imagined model of an ignorant, priest-ridden peasantry or proletariat, replacing religious and superstitious belief with equally far-fetched notions of how society works, turns out to be completely wrong. It has typically been the professors, the university students, the managers, the journalists, and the civil servants who have concocted and disseminated the conspiracies.   Conspiracy theories are not, then, the province of a googly- eyed lunatic fringe. Conspiratorial thinking is not limited to the stupid, the ignorant, or the crazy. It is a reflex of the storytelling mind’s compulsive need for meaningful experience. Conspiracy theories offer ultimate answers to a great mystery of the human condition: why are things so bad in the world? They provide nothing less than a solution to the problem of evil. In the imaginative world of the conspiracy theorist, there is no accidental badness. To the conspiratorial mind, shit never just happens. History is not just one damned thing after another, and only dopes and sheeple believe in coincidences. For this reason, conspiracy theories—no matter how many devils they invoke—are always consoling in their simplicity. Bad things do not happen because of a wildly complex swirl of abstract historical and social variables. They happen because bad men live to stalk our happiness. And you can fight, and possibly even defeat, bad men. If you can read the hidden story.

9. This is, in essence, a by-product explanation of religion, and it is the one that most current evolutionary thinkers embrace. We have religion because, by nature, we abhor explanatory vacuums. In sacred fiction, we find the master confabulations of the storytelling mind.
   - Location: 1669-1671
   - Page: 109

10. In his trailblazing book Darwin’s Cathedral, the biologist David Sloan Wilson proposes that religion emerged as a stable part of all human societies for a simple reason: it made them work better. Human groups that happened to possess a faith instinct so thoroughly dominated nonreligious competitors that religious tendencies became deeply entrenched in our species. Wilson argues that religion provides multiple benefits to groups. First, it defines a group as a group. As the sociologist Émile Durkheim wrote, “Religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices . . . which unite into one single moral community called a Church all those who adhere to them.” Second, religion coordinates behavior within the group, setting up rules and norms, punishments and rewards. Third, religion provides a powerful incentive system that promotes group cooperation and suppresses selfishness. The science writer Nicholas Wade expresses the heart of Wilson’s idea succinctly: the evolutionary function of religion “is to bind people together and make them put the group’s interests ahead of their own.”

11. The characters in fiction are just wiggles of ink on paper (or chemical stains on celluloid). They are ink people. They live in ink houses inside ink towns. They work at ink jobs. They have inky problems. They sweat ink and cry ink, and when they are cut, they bleed ink. And yet ink people press effortlessly through the porous membrane separating their inky world from ours. They move through our flesh-and-blood world and wield real power in it. As we have seen, this is spectacularly true of sacred fictions. The ink people of scripture have a real, live presence in our world. They shape our behaviors and our customs, and in so doing, they transform societies and histories. This is also true of ordinary fiction. In 1835, Edward Bulwer-Lytton wrote a novel called Rienzi. The young Richard Wagner was inspired by the novel and decided to base an opera on it. Bulwer-Lytton conjured people out of paper and ink. Wagner put those ink people onstage and told their story in song. Those songs changed Adolf Hitler and, through Hitler, the world. Wagner’s ink people—Siegfried, Parsifal, Rienzi—may have been significant in the wild mix of factors that brought on the worst war in history, and the worst genocide.

12. The emotions of fiction are highly contagious, and so are the ideas. As the psychologist Raymond Mar writes, “Researchers have repeatedly found that reader attitudes shift to become more congruent with the ideas expressed in a [fiction] narrative.” In fact, fiction seems to be more effective at changing beliefs than nonfiction, which is designed to persuade through argument and evidence

13. Among the books burned that night in 1933 was the play Almansor (1821) by the German Jewish writer Heinrich Heine. The play contains this famous and prophetic line: “Where they burn books, they will also ultimately burn people.”

14. as the psychologist Jerome Bruner observes, memory may “serve many masters aside from truth.” If the purpose of memory is to provide a photo-perfect record of the past, then memory is deeply flawed. But if the purpose of memory is to allow us to live better lives, then the plasticity of memory may actually be useful. Memory may be faulty by design.
   - Location: 2289-2291
   - Page: 150

15. As the psychologists Carol Tavris and Eliot Aronson put it, memory is an “unreliable, self-serving historian . . . Memories are often pruned and shaped by an ego-enhancing bias that blurs the edges of past events, softens culpability, and distorts what really happened.” Put differently, we misremember the past in a way that allows us to maintain protagonist status in the stories of our own lives.

## Viral Loop
**Author:** Adam L. Penenberg

### Highlights (3)

1. something known as a power law curve, characterized by a soft-edged L shape (see Figs. 4–7). It has other names, too: the 80–20 rule, Pareto’s law, the law of the vital few, the principle of factor sparsity, the long tail. The concept originated in 1906, the inspiration of Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who realized that 20 percent of the population owned 80 percent of the property in Italy. He fashioned power law curves to posit that wealth follows a “predictable imbalance,” leading to a winner-take-all society. Although no one knows exactly why, power laws describe a dizzying array of natural and unnatural phenomena—everything from ranking the size of planets, galaxies, and lakes by volume to Newtonian physics.

2. Mass audiences on this scale carry serious potential, hence the fantastical valuations viral loop companies have achieved. That’s because if you can get that many people to use your product, someone somewhere will pay you to reach them. Even if your strategy is limited to getting big and bought, you have the opportunity to auction off yourself (and your millions of users) to the highest bidder and let the next guy worry about wringing revenue from your audience.
   - Location: 989-992
   - Page: 65

3. Successful viral expansion loop businesses share the following characteristics: Web-based: They are far better suited to the frictionless world of the Internet. Free: Users consume the product at no charge; after aggregating a mass audience, it may be possible to overlay various revenue streams (offer premium services, for example). Organizational technology: They don’t create content—their users do. They simply organize it. But facilitating can lead to a mass audience. Just ask Google. Simple concept: Easy and intuitive to use. Built-in virality: Users spread the product purely out of their own self-interest and, in the process, offer a powerful word-of-mouth endorsement to each subsequent user. (And word of mouth is widely viewed as the best form of advertising.) This means that viral loop products have within themselves the seeds to grow on their own. Extremely fast adoption: Within a month of Facebook’s launch, half of Harvard’s student body had joined. Within thirteen months, 12 million people had downloaded Skype. Hotmail had 30 million users within thirty months. Yet none of them required a dime for marketing or a sales force. Exponential growth: Because each user attracts more users, there is a tandem growth model. This is in sharp contrast to a “normal” business, which more typically grows linearly (and far more slowly), at a rate usually corresponding to its marketing spend. Virality index: For the user base to grow exponentially, virality must equal or exceed 1.0. In the aggregate, one user becomes two, turns into four, eight, and so on. Anything less than 1 and virality cannot be self-sustaining. Predictable growth rates: If a product is properly designed with viral hooks, it spreads at a constant rate—assuming there are sufficient numbers of people—and can be accurately forecast, in the same way epidemiologists can predict with some certainty how quickly a virus will spread through a city. Network effects: The more who join, the more who have an incentive to join. A telephone, for example, becomes continually more useful to those who already have one as more people are added to the network. Stackability: A viral network can be laid over the top of another, each fostering the other’s growth (PayPal and eBay; YouTube and MySpace). Point of nondisplacement: A tipping point, when a company attracts so many users it continues to grow; it becomes nearly impossible for a competitor to take it down. Ultimate saturation: After a network has spread far and wide, it can reach a point of maturity when growth slows. This happened to both MySpace and Facebook, both of which saw their growth rates slow from 3 percent a month to about 1 percent—and in MySpace’s case even decline slightly. Nevertheless, they had already amassed substantial user bases, with a full 20 percent of users considered “addicts” who made up almost 75 percent of visits.

## Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid
**Author:** Robert J. Sternberg

### Highlights (86)

1. 1. Stupidity contains both cognitive and moral implications. Recall Köhler’s description of how he responds to watching a chimpanzee make a bad or stupid error. He admits feeling frustrated and angry. Similarly, Dweck and other contributors to this book seem to be implying that stupid behavior is somehow morally wrong because the actor is failing to use her existing abilities to full advantage. The failure or departure for optimal behavior is inexcusable given the knowledge and cognitive capacities of the actor.
   - Location: 450-453
   - Page: 30

2. 3. Many acts of stupidity, or seeming stupidity, result from mindlessness. While this seems trivially obvious, we have to be careful about how we explicate this principle. As Perkins and others have noted, because of the limitations of controlled processing, we cannot be mindful of all our actions. Indeed, the overwhelming activity of the brain and cognitive processing occurs outside of conscious control. Some aspects of wisdom, as Sternberg envisions it, and expertise are prototypically automatic, unconscious and “mindless.” To preserve our limited mindful processing capacity for important matters, we have no choice but to automate as many mundane processes as possible. One could argue that it would be stupid to try to be mindful about every situation that we confront. Intelligence and/or wisdom might consist in knowing what to be mindful about and when to delegate processing to mindlessness. Perkins makes the interesting suggestion that it might be possible to develop mindless procedures that actually prevent the sort of folly he discusses.
   - Location: 462-470
   - Page: 31

3. 4. Many acts of apparent stupidity result from limited or inadequate information and resources. The authors who explicitly make this point do not necessarily deny that stupidity can stem from inadequate information and resources. They find such causes uninteresting. However, it would be within the spirit of least some of the contributions to deny the label of “stupidity” to such acts. After all, this can be seen as a justifiable or excusable reason for behaving in a maladaptive way.
   - Location: 470-473
   - Page: 31

4. 6. Smart people can be stupid just because they are smart. I have used the examples of Alfred Russel Wallace and Arthur Conan Doyle to make this point.
   - Location: 493-494
   - Page: 33

5. For many years I have studied the beliefs that make smart people dumb—beliefs that make them do dumb things, and also cause them to fall behind intellectually over time. In fact, this has been the central issue in my research: why people who have all the ability one could wish for often don’t use it when they need it most and can even lose it (relative to their initially less able peers). The reason for this, ironically, lies in the very fact that many smart people become too invested in being smart. They think of smartness as something that they have and others don’t—as something that makes them special and worthy. As a result, they become too focused on being smart and looking smart rather than on challenging themselves, stretching and expanding their skills, becoming smarter. In other words, they focus on the trait of intelligence and on proving that they have it, rather than on the process of learning and growing over time.
   - Location: 532-538
   - Page: 35

6. The focus of this chapter, however, is not on the true nature of intelligence. It’s on the profound consequences of what people believe about their intelligence. Once people believe their intelligence is fixed, a number of things start happening, for although they believe their intelligence is fixed, they do not know at what level it is fixed. Is it really high or is it disappointingly low? So they look to their performance outcomes to tell them—but they must try to ensure that every outcome they look at will be an unqualified success. As will be seen, this sets in motion a variety of defensive and self-defeating behaviors, such as a tendency to sacrifice valuable learning opportunities that might expose inadequacies, even when these opportunities may be vital to their long-term success. In contrast, once people believe that their intelligence is a potential that can be developed, they start focusing, not on the short-term outcomes that might make them look good, but on the effort and strategies that will lead to learning and long-term achievement. I turn now to research that supports and illuminates these ideas.
   - Location: 554-562
   - Page: 37

7. In other words, when people believe that intelligence is a fixed trait, they often see poor performance as indicating that they lack intelligence, and they often see lacking intelligence as signaling low worth as a person. In this way they generalize from an academic outcome to intelligence to worth. In this framework, then, doing well and having intelligence makes you a special and worthy person (perhaps better than others), but doing poorly puts you in the category of the unworthy.
   - Location: 602-605
   - Page: 40

8. Compared to the students who were focused on the idea of fixed intelligence, those who had been taught to focus on malleable intelligence now saw their difficulty as reflecting on their effort and were more persistent in their pursuit of task mastery. This study also showed that the belief in fixed intelligence could be changed and that when it is, people begin to think differently about what their setbacks mean.
   - Location: 623-625
   - Page: 41

9. One of the dumbest things people with the fixed view of intelligence do is to sacrifice important learning opportunities when those opportunities contain a risk of revealing ignorance or making errors. Of course, the very idea of learning implies that there is something you don’t already know. Yet people who hold the fixed view of intelligence feel they cannot afford to reveal their ignorance and make errors because, as we saw, this can call their intelligence and even their worth into question.
   - Location: 635-638
   - Page: 42

10. To summarize, students who hold a fixed view of their intelligence care so much about looking smart that they act dumb, for what could be dumber than giving up a chance to learn something that is essential for your own success? If a valuable learning opportunity contains the risk of errors or requires them to confront a deficiency, they may well sacrifice that opportunity. I believe that this is one of the major ways that smart people can become relatively less smart over time. If others are availing themselves of these learning opportunities and you are simply displaying over and over again the skills you already have, then you will almost certainly lose your edge.
   - Location: 664-669
   - Page: 44

11. Many people who hold the fixed view of intelligence hold yet another belief that makes them do dumb things. It is the belief that if you’re truly intelligent, you don’t need effort. (Or that if you need effort, you’re not intelligent.) Specifically, people who hold a fixed theory of their intelligence agree more with statements like these: “If you’re really smart at something, you shouldn’t have to work hard at it.” “Things come easily to people who are true geniuses.” They also agree that “If you have to work hard at something, you’re probably not very good at it.” In contrast, those students who hold the malleable theory agree instead with statements declaring that even geniuses have to work hard to arrive at their great discoveries or creations (Dweck 1999; Dweck & Leggett 1988).
   - Location: 670-676
   - Page: 44

12. Moreover, as we will see, the experts agree on one thing: motivation (engagement, effort, persistence) is the key to creative accomplishment and even creative genius. Those who believe that smart people shouldn’t have to work hard may not put in the work required to accomplish what they’re really capable of. That is, they may fail to fulfill their potential.
   - Location: 679-682
   - Page: 45

13. Indeed, the belief that effort is not necessary for smart people and that needing effort is a sign of incompetence will lead to a host of self-defeating behavior. First, it means that when confronted with a challenge that requires their effort, people who believe in fixed intelligence will start to worry about their intelligence. Just when they need all their resources to figure out how to solve the problem, they will be distracted by concerns about their adequacy. Second, they may well do something defensive, and unfortunately many defensive things they might do to save face are things that are likely to compromise their performance. For example, they might decide to slacken or withhold their effort, perhaps pretending not to care. While this choice may prevent a “true” assessment of their ability (since, after all, you can’t judge the intelligence of someone who didn’t really try), it may doom their performance. This phenomenon is called self-handicapping (Berglas 1990), and it is the tendency to do things that will prevent you from looking like you have low ability, even if these are things that jeopardize your performance. When people self-handicap, it means that they care more about looking smart (or avoiding looking dumb) than about accomplishing something.
   - Location: 682-691
   - Page: 45

14. Earlier in this chapter we saw that people who believe in fixed intelligence will sacrifice important learning opportunities that might put their sense of their intelligence on the line. Here, we see that people who believe in fixed intelligence sometimes directly sabotage their accomplishments by withholding effort. Even aside from the fact that effort is nearly always a key ingredient in important, long-term successes, effort is something people should enjoy.

16. American society tends to believe that geniuses are born and not made—that people are born with special talents, that these talents are evident early, and that they more or less naturally blossom forth over time. Our great poets, philosophers, composers, and scientists, we believe, were poetic, philosophical, musical, or scientific babies. In fact, we’ve built whole mythologies about the wondrous things our favorite geniuses did as tots. The problem is that although some of this may be true, much of it is not. Many of our most hailed geniuses appeared somewhat ordinary as children (Howe 1999). In fact, Charles Darwin’s father was disappointed in how ordinary his son seemed as a child (Simonton 1999); yet, as we know, Darwin through his dedication went on to become one of the greatest scientific geniuses of all time. According to Howe (1999), Tolstoy, William James, John Stuart Mill, and Norbert Wiener were also considered to be unexceptional children. Studies of brilliant musicians reveal a similar pattern. For example, a study of exceptional pianists then in their thirties (Sosniak 1985) asked the question of what set them apart from their peers in their earlier years. The answer was that there were no early indications that they would be the ones to succeed. Indeed, in adolescence their progress had in most cases been no better than that of hundreds of other young pianists. In another study of promising young violinists (Ericcson, Krampe, & Klemens 1993), it was the number of hours of practice, not “innate talent” that predicted skill level. Indeed the literature is full of accounts of talented young people who fizzled out (see, e.g., Howe 1999), yet another testimony to the role of motivation in the development and perpetuation of talent.

17. In fact, creativity researchers have come up with what they call the “ten-year rule”—the idea that no truly great creative contributions come without at least ten years of intense effort and preparation (Hayes 1989; see Weisberg 1986). Actually, as Hayes (1989) points out, it often takes ten years for people such as painters, poets, or composers to master the technical expertise of their field and then another ten to arrive at the point where they can make an extraordinary creative contribution (see also Policastro & Gardner 1999).

20. Intelligence praise taught students that intelligence is a fixed quality and that it can be measured from their performance. They quickly became afraid of challenge, they sacrificed learning, and they stopped enjoying effort. Not surprisingly, their skills suffered. In contrast, praise that focused on effort seemed to convey that the task skills were acquirable through effort. These students relished the challenge, wanted to learn more, and sought continued effort. Their task skills, not surprisingly, flourished. In summary, contrary to popular belief, praising people’s intelligence does not fortify them. It might buoy them up temporarily, but it instills beliefs that make them vulnerable. Focusing people on “process,” such as their effort or their strategies, is what seems to fortify them. That is, it motivates them in a way that allows them to withstand and even thrive on setbacks. These experiments thus encapsulate the theme of this chapter: an undue focus on intelligence can make smart people dumb; a focus on effort can make people smarter.

21. In this chapter I have spelled out the beliefs that can make smart people dumb: the belief that intellectual ability is fixed; the idea that current performance measures long-term potential; and the belief that people who are truly gifted don’t need effort for their achievements. I have shown how these beliefs can stunt intellectual growth. I have also spelled out the beliefs that foster the growth of talent and even genius over time: the belief that intellectual potential can be developed; the idea that current performance simply tells you where you are and what you need to do now; and the belief that everyone needs sustained effort to realize their potential and make truly noteworthy contributions. What this really means is that people are, to a large extent, in charge of their own intelligence. Being smart—and staying smart—is not just a gift, not just a product of their genetic good fortune. It is very much a product of what they put into it. It means that being smart is a long process of self-development and self-discovery.

22. Hogarth (1987) provided a catalog of common biases that affect the acquisition of information, the processing of information, and response selection. These biases have been applied to the context of managerial problem solving (Wagner 1991): Acquisition Biases Managers must acquire a tremendous amount of information as they attempt to understand the problems they confront. A number of biases can affect their acquisition of information: 1. Managers overestimate the frequency of occurrence of highly salient or publicized events and underestimate the frequency of occurrence of less salient or publicized events (i.e., the availability heuristic). Consequently, their view of events associated with the problem to be solved may be distorted. 2. Information acquired early in the problem-solving process receives too much weight; information acquired late in the problem-solving process receives too little weight. Managers conceptualize their problems (i.e., develop a problem-solving “set”) on the basis of the initial information available to them. Subsequent information is interpreted in terms of the conceptualization that emerged from analysis of the initial information, and thus subsequent information may not receive the weight it should receive. 3. Managers have difficulty conceptualizing problems in ways that transcend their own prior knowledge and experience. Consequently, every problem a marketing manager is given is seen as a marketing problem, every problem that a personnel manager is given is seen as a personnel problem, and so on. 4. Managers discover what they expect to discover. What managers anticipate influences what they perceive. In addition, managers seek out information that is consistent with their views, and disregard or suppress information that is inconsistent with their views. 5. When making comparisons, managers give greater weight to the total number of successes rather than to a ratio of the number of successes to the number of successes and failures. When, for example, managers must decide whom to promote, they tend to evaluate candidates on the basis of the absolute number of previous “hits” (i.e., times when the candidate really came through on an assignment), forgetting to consider a candidate’s “misses.” Thus, a newer candidate who has had more hits per assignment will lose out to a candidate with a longer, yet poorer, track record. 6. Concrete information (e.g., personal experience) is given more weight than abstract information (e.g., evaluative reports), even when the abstract information is more valid. Managers pay more attention to things they observe firsthand, even when what they can observe firsthand presents a less representative picture than that obtainable from other sources. Processing Biases Once relevant information has been acquired, it must be processed. Biases that can affect processing include the following: 1. Managers apply evaluative criteria inconsistently when they must evaluate a number of courses of action. Because evaluative criteria shift, comparable courses of action are unlikely to be valued equally. 2. Once an opinion has been formed, it is not likely to be changed even in the face of new information. Managers quickly become invested in their opinions. New information that suggests the need to revise prior opinions tends to be discounted. 3. Managers are not able to estimate the products of nonlinear relations. For example, a cost that increases exponentially will be underestimated. 4. Managers are likely to continue using an alternative that has worked before even when it no longer is appropriate. Personnel managers rely on selection tests as predictors of managerial performance. The predictive power of such tests is modest, at best, yet managers will rely on test scores when making decisions about individuals for whom criterion information is available. 5. Managers overestimate the stability of data based on small samples. When managers go beyond qualitative opinion and collect data relevant to solving a particular problem, they are likely to overestimate the stability of the data they have collected. 6. Managers make predictions by adjusting expectations relative to an anchor without questioning the continued validity of the anchor. For example, sales managers may set a goal of increasing sales by 10 percent over last quarter, without considering any special circumstances that might have affected last quarter’s sales figures. Response Biases Managers are prone to two biases affecting their response to problems: 1. Managers are prone to engage in wishful thinking. As a consequence, they judge the probability of outcomes they favor to be greater than the data warrant, and the probability of outcomes they fear to be less than the data warrant. 2. Managers succumb to the illusion of control. The illusion of control refers to an overestimation of the potency of one’s actions. By planning for the future, managers may come to believe that they have more control over future outcomes than they in fact have, and to underestimate the importance of factors such as luck and economic conditions, over which they have no control.

23. 1. Despite folk accounts to the contrary, even the most eminent individuals in science, in sports, or in the arts require a decade or more of intense training prior to achieving world-class levels of performance. 2. All practice and training is not equally profitable. A key appears to be deliberate practice, which is an effortful and intense regime of training activities designed for the single purpose of improving current levels of performance. 3. Expertise is not acquired cheaply. It requires intense effort, sustained motivation, and sufficient resources, all applied for a decade or more.

24. THE NATURE OF EXPERTISE Cognitive studies of expert performance have provided important insights into the nature of expertise. Beginning with de Groot’s (1965) seminal studies of chess masters, studies of expert performance expanded to include a wide variety of domains (for reviews see Chi et al. 1988; Ericsson 1996; Ericsson & Smith 1991; Hoffman 1996). Major findings of particular relevance to problem solving include the following (Patel, Arocha, & Kaufman 1999): 1. Experts spend proportionally more time assessing the problem and less time solving it, compared to novices who do just the opposite. 2. Experts recognize and categorize problems on the basis of deeper principles, whereas novices recognize and categorize problems on the basis of surface features. 3. Experts are able to perceive large patterns of information quickly. 4. Experts have superior memory, both short- and long-term, for problem-relevant information.
   - Location: 1174-1182
   - Page: 77

25. For present purposes, the most important characteristic of the nature of expertise is that the superior assessment, categorization, perceptual, and memory abilities just mentioned are restricted to the expert’s specific domain of expertise. Thus, chess masters show superior memory for chess pieces when deployed in game configurations but not for chess pieces deployed randomly. In summary, the phenomenon of uneven levels of performance for an individual across different contexts—described in the previous section for academic and practical contexts—is exacerbated by the development of expertise. The development of expertise is a process whereby broader abilities are honed to sharper ones in which extremely high levels of performance are manifested in extremely narrow domains.

27. Hogan and colleagues (1990) describe three idealized types of individuals who typically rise in organizations before failing, often with catastrophic results to the organization. The high-likability floater has a profile on personality inventories of high scores on likability, low to average scores on ambition, and normal scores on other dimensions. High-likability floaters are congenial and charming. They make great dinner companions and entertainers. They are supportive of the organization and others, and never complain or argue. They rise in organizations because they are so well liked. However, they have no real point of view or vision, no agenda, and they do not take a stand on important issues. They accomplish little with the exception of maintaining morale. Eventually, they rise to the point of being in charge of a unit that matters, and their incompetence becomes obvious. However, getting rid of them is very difficult because they are so well liked. The second type of managerial failure, called hommes de ressentiment, refers to individuals who appear on the surface to be composed, socially skilled, and even charming. However, they are motivated by an underlying deep strain of resentment, hostility, and desire for revenge. Such individuals who attain managerial positions tend to be cautious and to make minimal self-disclosures, thereby concealing their underlying resentment. Eventually they get caught in some act that seems totally out of character and unbelievable, but actually it is consistent with their underlying anger. The third type of managerial failure is the narcissist. Narcissism is a well-studied personality disorder that represents a combination of attitudes including feelings of entitlement, exhibitionism, expectations of special privileges, exemptions from social demands, feelings of omnipotence in controlling others, intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to focus on one’s own mental products, including viewing contributions of others as extensions of oneself. What makes this type of managerial failure interesting is that narcissists share many of the positive characteristics that are attributed to aggressive managers, athletic coaches, military commanders, and political leaders. Narcissistic individuals tend to be described as appearing self-confident, highly energetic, competitive, achievement-oriented, aggressive, outgoing, and leader-like. By comparison, a twenty-year study of Army brigadier generals yielded comparable attributes including dominant, competitive, action-oriented, and aggressively adventurous (Campbell 1987). However, narcissistic individuals also tend to be egotistical, manipulative, self-seeking, and exploitative. Narcissists do not accept suggestions from others. Doing so might make them appear weak, which conflicts with their need for self-enhancement. Some narcissists have such an inflated self-confidence that they don’t believe that others have anything useful to say to them. They also take more credit than they deserve, often at the expense of taking credit for the contributions of co-workers and subordinates. Conversely, they avoid taking responsibility for shortcomings and failures. Narcissistic individuals often are influential in group settings because they have such conviction in the worth of their ideas that others tend to believe them and follow. They also tend to self-nominate, thereby filling leadership gaps that open above them. Narcissistic managers survive as long as they do by currying favor with their superiors. Eventually, they slip and behave in an egotistical way with an important superior or fall in a revolt carried out by exploited subordinates who seize an opportunity.

28. OZLEM AYDUK & WALTER MISCHEL 5 When Smart People Behave Stupidly RECONCILING INCONSISTENCIES IN SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE A curious discrepancy exists between everyday experience and the widespread belief that intelligence is a broad, generalized attribute that characterizes a person consistently. The latter suggests that a smart person should generally be smart; the former makes it clear that smart people often behave in remarkably stupid ways. Recent documentation comes in the painful details of President Clinton’s sojourn to impeachment (Marrow 1999). Even more surprising, if less publicized, was the fall of Sol Wachtler, chief judge of the State of New York and the court of appeals, to incarceration as a felon in federal prison. Judge Wachtler was well known for advocating laws to make marital rape a punishable crime, and he was deeply respected for his landmark decisions on free speech, civil rights, and right-to-die issues. After his mistress left him for another man, however, Judge Wachtler spent thirteen months writing obscene letters, making lewd phone calls, and threatening to kidnap her daughter. His descent from the court’s bench as the model of jurisprudence and moral wisdom to federal prison testifies that smart people are not necessarily consistently so across different areas of their lives: as novelists (even if not all social scientists) have long known, smart lives are not without their stupid episodes. Although stupidity on the part of generally competent people can take endless forms and produce all sorts of unfortunate outcomes, in this chapter we focus on those “stupid behaviors” in which people undermine the pursuit and achievement of valued long-term goals by failing to control or forgo immediate temptations and impulses—as when the tobacco addict, coughing with emphysema, lights another cigarette after having solemnly resolved to never do so again.

29. Hot/Cool System Analysis of Delay of Gratification Drawing on diverse areas of research on self-regulation, and consistent with the reasoning and the findings presented, two systems have been proposed to account for self-regulatory behavior: an emotional “hot” system and a cognitive “cool” system (Metcalfe & Mischel 1999). The hot system is an emotional “go” system, specialized for quick reactions to strong, emotion-provoking stimuli that trigger pleasure and pain. It is fully developed at birth, and in current neural models its processing has been associated with the amygdala (Gray 1987; LeDoux 1996; Metcalfe & Jacobs 1996, 1998). Once activated, hot system processing calls for instantaneous action: rapid hot reactions to appetitive and sexual stimuli, and the automatic enactment of defensive reactions when faced with threat. Similar to what Freud (1911/1959) referred to as the “id,” the unconscious structure of the mind that responds to sexual and aggressive impulses and seeks immediate gratification or tension reduction, the hot system is under stimulus control (e.g., the steaming pizza for the dieter, the cocaine for the drug addict). Put another way, it responds to consummatory aspects of the stimulus, and motivates individuals for the ultimate goal response (e.g., ringing the bell and eating the pretzels). The cool system, on the other hand, is an emotionally neutral “know” system—cognitive, complex, and contemplative—that develops with age. It is attuned to the informational, cognitive, and spatial aspects of stimuli and generates rational, reflective and strategic behavior. This system is thought to be associated with hippocampal and frontal lobe processing, two structures of the brain that, like delay ability, begin to develop around the age of four (Metcalfe & Mischel 1999).

30. The hot/cool system analysis makes the specific prediction that focusing attention on the consummatory features of the delayed rewards should activate hot system processing and hinder delay, whereas focusing on its informational, abstract, cool features should activate the cool system and enhance delay. Data that support the predicted effects of “hot” and “cool” representations on delay come from a study in which some children were cued to think about the exposed rewards in one of two ways. Some children were instructed to think about the cool, abstract qualities of the rewards—for example, by thinking about the marshmallows they were waiting for as puffy, round clouds. Other children were told to think about how sweet and chewy the marshmallows would be in their mouth, thus activating a hot representation of the rewards. As expected, when children thought about the rewards in hot terms, they were able to wait only for five minutes, whereas when they thought about them in cool terms, delay time increased to thirteen minutes (Mischel & Baker 1975). Overall, the evidence reviewed so far shows that regardless of the objective situation (i.e., whether one’s temptations are present or absent from view), people can activate either hot or cool system processing through the ways in which they construe and mentally represent events. Despite inherent difficulties and frustration in certain self-regulatory tasks, then, people have the power to create the mental conditions that can help them resist temptation and cope with adversity.

31. Delay Ability as a Protective Factor against Dispositional Vulnerabilities The cognitive-attentional strategies necessary for exertion of willpower and impulse control discussed so far may also help protect people against their personal vulnerabilities. Consider the disposition to anxiously anticipate and severely react to personal rejection, referred to as rejection sensitivity. A cognitive-affective vulnerability characterized by heightened fears and expectations of rejection, rejection sensitivity is believed to stem from experiences of neglect and rejection in early life (Downey & Feldman 1996; Feldman & Downey 1994). When people high in rejection sensitivity encounter behaviors that could be interpreted as rejection (e.g., one’s partner talking to somebody else at a party), they tend to construe them as intentionally hurtful. Perceptions of intentional rejection trigger strong negative emotions such as anger, resentment, or jealousy, and activate maladaptive, automatic behavioral scripts. For example, rejection-sensitive men who seek and value intimacy are more physically violent toward their partners than are men who are low in rejection sensitivity (Downey, Feldman, & Ayduk 2000). Similarly, highly rejection-sensitive women express more hostility during conflicts, and withdraw support and start fights when they feel rejected (Ayduk et al. 1999). Not surprisingly, the relationships of highly rejection-sensitive people end sooner than those of low rejection-sensitive people (Downey et al. 1998). In sum, when people who are sensitive to rejection feel that they have been rebuffed, “hot” responses occur without the mediation and benefit of more complex, “cool” cognitive processes that enable reflection and rational problem solving (Metcalfe & Mischel 1999). Not all people who fear and expect rejection, however, end up in a jealous rage or lash out at their partners at the slightest sign of inattentiveness. Some highly rejection-sensitive people may be able to cope better than others with situations likely to elicit impulsive, potentially relation-destructive reactions. The self-regulatory task for the rejection-sensitive person may be similar to that of the four-year-old waiting for the marshmallows: the former must deal with the sense of threat and stress elicited by signs of rejection, while the latter must attenuate the frustration and aversiveness of the waiting period. In both cases the regulatory task is to inhibit reflexive, hot system reactions by accessing cool system processing. Thus, theoretically, there is reason to believe that the attentional processes that enable people to delay gratification and inhibit impulsive reactions in the face of temptation may also help protect them from their own tendencies to react maladaptively in situations that activate their rejection concerns (Metcalfe & Mischel 1999; Mischel, Cantor, & Feldman 1996; Lang, Bradley & Cuthbert 1990). Therefore, we examined whether delay of gratification ability protects people high in rejection sensitivity against negative outcomes in terms of both their personal well-being (self-esteem, depression) and their relationships with others (aggression) (Ayduk et al., 2000). Preschoolers who had participated in the original delay experiments were followed up when they were around the age of twenty-seven, more than twenty years after the initial assessment of their delay ability. The results from this study showed that rejection-sensitive people who had low ability to delay gratification as pre-schoolers reported lower self-esteem, self-worth, and general coping ability as adults compared to those low in rejection sensitivity in young adulthood. By contrast, highly rejection-sensitive adults who had high delay ability as preschoolers were not distinguishable from low rejection-sensitive individuals. They were also perceived by their parents as having higher self-esteem and being more able to deal with stress than were rejection-sensitive people with low delay ability. This general pattern was replicated in a preadolescent, at-risk sample. Highly rejection-sensitive middle schoolers who had shown low delay of gratification ability in kindergarten were more susceptible to low self-worth, to heightened physical aggression against peers, and to being shunned by their peers than were their similarly rejection-sensitive peers who had been able to wait longer in the delay situation.

32. Role of Cognitive-Attentional Strategies in Coping with Rejection Sensitivity To more directly address the role of cognitive-attentional strategies in protecting rejection-sensitive individuals from their own maladaptive tendencies, a self-control strategies measure for college students was developed, and its interactions with rejection sensitivity were explored (Ayduk 1999). The measure asks participants to imagine they are on a diet and have the intention of not eating a slice of hot, steaming pizza in front of them. Thus, the measure activates the basic conflict inherent in the childhood delay situation of wanting to consume an immediate reward after having committed to not eating it. The scenario is followed by a series of potential cognitive-attentional strategies, some of which are theoretically ineffective (e.g., thinking about how yummy the pizza is) and some effective (e.g., thinking about how unhealthful fat and grease are) in exerting willpower. Strategic self-control is indexed by the use of effective strategies and the avoidance of ineffective strategies. In a study that examined hostility in relationship conflict using this measure (Ayduk 1999), people high in rejection sensitivity reported higher levels of verbal aggression (e.g., yelling, insulting, cursing) toward their partners than people low in rejection sensitivity only if they also had lower levels of strategic self-control. Those highly rejection-sensitive people with high strategic self-control, however, reported lower levels of hostility and were similar to people low in rejection sensitivity. Taken together with the previous findings reviewed, these results suggest that attention deployment and cognitive reconstrual may play a role in regulating the interpersonal self. In interpersonal situations, for example, highly rejection-sensitive individuals who cannot deploy attention strategically may have an attentional bias to focus on rejection cues as well as their own internal emotional states. This may make it difficult for them to encode contextual information that could provide alternative explanations for others’ behaviors (Dodge 1980; Downey & Feldman 1996), leading them to readily perceive intentional rejection in a perpetrator’s behavior. Conversely, rejection-sensitive individuals with high self-regulatory ability may strategically and purposefully avoid focusing on negative behaviors of others or the sense of foreboding that they typically feel when facing potential rejection. Such cooling strategies should enable them to instead attend to situational information, and generate alternative explanations to others’ behavior. By making finer distinctions between intentional rejection and ambiguous behavior that may be benignly intended, they may be less susceptible to false alarms and a rapid generation of the fight-or-flight response. Rejection-sensitive people high in delay of gratification ability also may be better in attenuating the threat they perceive in rejection cues through cognitive reappraisal (Kelley 1955; Mischel 1974). Rather than taking an argument with a romantic partner as indicative of the end of their relationship, they may reconstrue it as simply a difference of opinion, restrict the event’s negativity to a single occasion, and prevent themselves from overemphasizing its significance. Likewise, a partner’s currently negative behavior can be understood as transitory and situationally induced (e.g., owing to stress), and its importance or centrality for the person’s long-term goals can be attenuated by placing such behavior in a broader context.

33. Over the past decade, however, a growing body of research has begun to recognize that people’s behavior varies stably and predictably across situations (e.g., if situation A then he does X, but if situation B then he does Y), and that such variability reflects the core of personality and provides a window through which to glimpse the underlying goals and motivations of the person

34. To illustrate, consider the example of Jack, who is a generally calm, sociable person. Every time his girlfriend attempts to do something with others that does not involve him, however, he becomes hostile and lashes out. Now imagine James, who is also a calm and sociable person. He does not mind so much if his girlfriend wants to do things without him. Instead, he gets very angry and spiteful when his girlfriend tells him what to do. Whereas both Jack and James are calm and friendly in general, each gets predictably angry and hostile in certain situations: Jake when his significant others try to establish independence from him, and James when they try to control him. Thus, being both gentle and hostile—like being smart and stupid—may be equally genuine facets that can coexist in the same, “real” person.

36. Sometimes stupid behavior in smart people may arise from faulty expectations, erroneous beliefs, or merely a lack of motivation to enact control strategies even when one has them. But sometimes it is an inability to regulate one’s affective states and the behavioral tendencies associated with them that leads to stupid and self-defeating behavior. In situations that contain “hot” features and activate automatic response tendencies, the power of the hot system may make it difficult for even the smartest people to exert self-control.

37. The accentuation of the hot system may have survival value in evolutionary terms, preventing humans from wasting time thinking and contemplating, and instead allowing them to fight, run from danger, or seize the moment for an appetizing meal or an opportunity for procreation.

The colloquial expression for this cognitive exercise is “putting yourself in the other person’s shoes.” It is important that when assuming the perspective of another person, you remain mindful of what was known and not known by that person at the time the decisions were made and judge the quality of the thinking by the actor’s own objectives and goals.

42. The literature on critical thinking is filled with examples where even experts fail to consider evidence that would disconfirm a preferred hypothesis (Mynatt, Doherty, & Tweney 1978). Psychologists know a great deal about errors and biases in the thought process (Halpern 1996). The tendency to seek only confirming evidence is robust and probably operates in many settings where it goes unrecognized (Nickerson 1998). Often, people cannot think of any reason why the preferred hypothesis might be wrong.

43. Krull and Anderson (1997) show how explanations of events are often stored in memory, much like other well-learned responses, instead of being constructed based on the facts at hand. When a pattern of events triggers the need to understand what is happening, people retrieve an explanation in a highly automatic manner. The stored explanation is applied to the present situation without considering possible differences between the event we are trying to explain and those that led to the memory of the explanation.

44. In a study of the way leaders respond to foreign policy situations, Houghton (1996) found that analogical reasoning is the most frequently used process for dealing with novel problems. Leaders first attempt to identify an appropriate analogy to the current situation, even when none is readily apparent. They then look for information that will increase the similarity between the earlier situation and present one. The ubiquitous confirmation bias—that is, the tendency to seek information that confirms what one believes to be true—is manifest in attempts to make the prior problem more similar to the new one than it actually is.

47. THE BASE-RATE FALLACY This fallacy is easy to detect. For example, in making inferences about people with learning disabilities, the typical person tends to ignore the fact that the proportion of people with these disabilities in the general population is relatively large. However, this proportion is grossly underrepresented on the large screen, on TV shows, in fictional literature, and in journalistic presentations (as is the proportion of portrayals of people who lead well-adjusted lives or who are only average in physical attractiveness). Thus, the mass media leads the public to believe that the proportion of people with learning disabilities is negligible, and, therefore, that their issues can be ignored.

48. PART-WHOLE FALLACY (THE FALLACY OF DIVISION) The fallacy of division is committed when people reason that what is true of the whole is necessarily true of each individual part of the whole. In other words, if X is diagnosed with a learning disability, then X will have all the components of the diagnostic definition present in his or her behavior. For example, if person X has a learning disability and exhibits particular behaviors, then, based on this fallacy, person Y, solely on the basis of his or her label as a person having the same learning disability, should also manifest all (or at least some) behaviors of person X.

49. THE FALLACY OF ROLE SUBSTITUTION (THE FALLACY OF DIFFERENTIAL REASONING) This fallacy refers to a type of reasoning, the structure and content of which changes depending on the position from which the arguing is done. The fallacy invokes the acceptability of two different lines of reasoning (e.g., one for friends and one for enemies).

50. THE FALLACY OF HASTY GENERALIZATION The fallacy of hasty generalization is committed when only exceptional (or rare) cases are considered and a generalization is drawn from those cases to create a rule that fits only those exceptions.

51. THE FALLACY OF REPRESENTATIVENESS This fallacy is committed when people decide that two or more things or events are related simply because they resemble each other. Movie portrayals of people with learning disabilities often depict such people as being more intuitive, “childlike,” spontaneous, and innocent—but also as more uncivilized, unpredictable, and dangerous—than are people without disabilities.

52. THE CONJUNCTION FALLACY: ASEXUALITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES The fallacy of conjunction appears when the co-occurrence of two events is viewed to be more likely than the probability of a component event. In the context of this chapter, the fallacy results in the stereotype that the probability of both having a disability and being asexual (i.e., not engaging in sexual relationships) is higher than that expected based on the probability of either having a disability or of being asexual.

53. Personality Traits Personality traits can be defined as persistent dispositional differences between individuals. They refer to those parts of our mental styles unrelated to intellectual abilities. Modern personality research often adopts a dimensional view. This is based on the observation that among those people who have undergone personality testing, most score in the medium-level range, with a few people at the extremes. This view replaces the older idea of personality “types,” based on the idea that, for example, everyone can be classified as either an extravert or an introvert. Astrology is a nonscientific type theory of personality because it separates people into twelve pigeonholes. There is little evidence to support type theories of personality. As an analogy, consider height in human adults. Most people have heights close to the average for the population, with very few being much taller or shorter than average. If we think of “rulers” to measure personality differences, how many do we need? Many researchers now think that a relatively small number of measures, usually called traits or dimensions, are just about sufficient to describe important personality differences among individuals. There is still some disagreement about the actual number. However, many psychologists are convinced by the scientific evidence for a five-factor model of personality (FFM, also called the “Big Five”). Table 9.1 lists these factors and their constituent facets. Two impressive bodies of evidence support the FFM. Versions of these five dimensions have been obtained from a wide range of personality questionnaires. In addition, the five factors emerge from “lexical” studies that seek clusters of personality terms existing in all human languages (Goldberg 1990). Indeed, many studies have found that the FFM trait structure of human personality applies across languages and cultures. These studies are important because they confirm the existence of personality traits as a component of human nature rather than as culturally determined.

54. NEUROTICISM There is massive scientific evidence showing that people with high Neuroticism scores suffer more personal distress and have impaired quality of life. (This is hinted at by one widely used definition of Neuroticism as a “tendency to experience and express negative emotions.”) Compared to the general population, individuals with high scores on Neuroticism are at increased risk for, among other things, stress-proneness, self-reported ill-health, medically unexplained conditions, eating disorders, divorce, and voluntarily leaving employment. These risks can be divided into three broad categories: stress, health, and relationships. Each of these is now discussed briefly.

55. EXTRAVERSION High scores on the personality trait of Extraversion are associated with the possession of good social skills. Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, extraverts tend to be happier than introverts (Argyle & Lu 1990). Indeed, personality accounts for a substantial proportion of individual differences in happiness, with Extraversion (positively) and Neuroticism (negatively) making the largest contributions (Brebner et al. 1995; Furnham & Cheng 1997). Hence it can be argued that introversion (particularly in combination with high N) is maladaptive, or at least predisposes individuals to self-confessed unhappiness. However, a nontrivial portion of the differences between individuals’ happiness levels is unaccounted for by personality, showing that personality is by no means the sole determinant of quality of life.

56. In terms of adaptive behavior, it seems probable that an extravert who chooses a career in librarianship or an introvert who ventures into sales will encounter more difficulties than those who pay more attention to their own personality traits when choosing a career.

57. Given that personality disorders are quite common (estimates vary between disorders in the range of 0.5 to 7 percent in the general population; Deary & Power 1998), it can be seen that these conditions are responsible for much distress and suffering. EXAMPLES OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS Little evidence suggests that patients with personality disorders differ in intelligence from the general population, with the exception of some indirect evidence for Antisocial personality disorder. This disorder is linked to criminal/delinquent behavior, which is in turn associated with below average IQ (McGarvey et al. 1981; Moffitt, Gabrielli, & Mednick 1981). Studies of other personality disorders have generally found no intelligence differences between patients and healthy controls. It is, however, clear that personality disorders are associated with disordered thinking and problematic interpersonal relationships. In this section the features of three particular disorders with differing patterns of social/interpersonal dysfunction are described. A review of the literature in this area and a discussion of cognitive processes in other personality disorders are given by Endler and Summer-feldt (1995). Diagnostic criteria for the three selected disorders are given in Table 9.3B. Paranoid personality disorder. The suspicion of the motives and actions of others that characterizes this disorder is linked to the highly efficient detection of (generally spurious) evidence that confirms the person’s view of external threats, while they simultaneously screen out disconfirming evidence. This “focused scanning” gives rise to a consistent, self-reinforcing negative view of the behavior and motives of others, with consequent maladaptive effects on social relationships. Histrionic personality disorder. The characteristics of this disorder include attention-seeking behavior, rapidly shifting and shallow emotions, and self-dramatization. The associated mode of thinking is “broad brush” in style, relying on rapid impression formation rather than attention to detail and on information from the outside world rather than from the person’s own belief system. In comparison to paranoid thinking, it is harder to completely connect this thinking style to all aspects of the problematic social behavior associated with the disorder. An inability to perceive others and the external world realistically appears to provide a partial explanation of some aspects of these problems, although emotional factors are clearly also relevant. TABLE 9.3(a). Brief Descriptions of the dsm-iv Personality Disorders Paranoid A pattern of distrust and suspiciousness such that others’ motives are interpreted as malevolent Schizoid A pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression Schizotypal A pattern of acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior Antisocial A pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others Borderline A pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity Histrionic A pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking Narcissistic A pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy Avoidant A pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation Dependent A pattern of submissive and clinging behavior related to an excessive need to be taken care of Obsessive-compulsive A pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control TABLE 9.3(b).

Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest 2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure 3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead 4. Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults 5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others 6. Consistent irresponsibility as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations 7. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another Source: Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Antisocial personality disorder. The aspects of this disorder that relate to irresponsible and/or criminal behavior together with a disregard for the consequences of such actions have been linked in a number of laboratory studies to insensitivity to impending punishment; this inability to learn from experience might easily be construed as stupidity. One aspect of the disorder is, in effect, a tendency to “live in the present.” Antisocial personality disorder is also associated with a pattern of specific social deficits involving deceitful and manipulative behavior and a lack of empathy. DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES—OLD AND NEW The psychiatric approach to personality disorder diagnosis has historically been a medical, classificatory one. Thus, either a personality disorder is present or it is not. Existing clinical scales involving the use of a questionnaire or checklist for the assessment of personality disorders reflect this binary system. This approach has, however, proved to be problematic because of the high levels of multiple diagnoses of personality disorder (Deary & Power 1998) and because of studies which have demonstrated that current diagnostic scales are of low reliability and validity (Clark, Livesley, & Morey 1997; Deary et al. 1998; Zimmerman 1994). This means that the use of these scales risks unacceptable rates of both false positive and false negative diagnoses and also that at least some personality disorders may currently not be well defined. The problems of understanding and diagnosing personality disorders might be resolved by considering these disorders as an aspect of individual differences in personality rather than distinct clinical conditions. From this viewpoint, personality disorders might be at least partially defined by a pattern of extreme scores on a relatively small number of broad personality dimensions. This leads to the idea that personality disorders manifest themselves subclinically in the general population rather than being confined to distinct clinical groups. If this is the case, an interesting question is whether there is a relationship between the FFM dimensions of normal personality described earlier and personality disorders. A considerable amount of evidence indicates that this is indeed the case. A number of studies have been carried out in which normal personality questionnaires and diagnostic questionnaires for personality disorders have been filled in by the same group of people. As a result, associations between scores on the two types of questionnaire can be investigated. There is still some disagreement about how many dimensions of personality disorder there are, but evidence from a large number of studies suggests that there are four, not five, such dimensions (Deary et al. 1998; Livesley, Jang, & Vernon 1998; Mulder & Joyce 1997; Schroeder & Livesley 1991; Presly & Walton 1973; Tyrer & Alexander 1979). The recent study by Livesley, Jang, and Vernon (1998) provides particularly strong evidence in favor of four “disordered personality” dimensions; in this work the same dimensions were found in both clinical sufferers and in the general population, showing that the same personality structure exists in both groups, with patients having higher scores. The basic picture of how “disordered” and normal personalities are related is reasonably clear, with each “disordered” dimension being associated with a normal personality trait. The naming of the “disordered” traits has not yet been finalized. Two possible naming schemes have been proposed by Mulder and Joyce (1997) and by Livesley, Jang, and Vernon (1998). The names in these two schemes are Asthenic/Emotional Disregulation, Asocial/Inhibitedness, Antisocial/Dissocial Behavior, and Anankastic/ Compulsive, and these are associated with high N, low E, low A, and high C, respectively. The Asthenic dimension includes a wide range of classical, medically defined personality disorders (Avoidant, Dependent, Paranoid, Schizotypal, Histrionic, Borderline) associated with personal distress/high Neuroticism. The existence of this dimension and its association with many personality disorders confirms that the distress-prone aspects of Neuroticism play an important role in personality disorder. The Asocial dimension identifies an overlapping set of personality disorders associated with problematic social interactions. Avoidant, Dependent, Schizotypal, Schizoid—all disorders that include a pattern of social avoidance and/or fear—are associated with maladaptively low Extraversion. Histrionic disorder, which also appears in this group, is by contrast associated with high Extraversion. The structure of the Asocial and Anankastic dimensions indicates that maladaptively low levels of Agreeableness are associated in particular with Antisocial personality disorder and also with Paranoid, Narcissistic, and Borderline disorders, whereas Obsessive-Compulsive disorder is associated with high levels of Conscientiousness. Reference to Tables 9.1 and 9.3 suggests the possibility that an excess of the C facets of orderliness, striving, and self-discipline might plausibly contribute to this disorder. The Antisocial/ Agreeableness association is obvious, but it is of interest that this analysis also draws attention to the importance of low Agreeableness in several other personality disorders, clarifying the cause of at least some part of the problematic social interactions reported by patients with personality disorder. The interpretation of Obsessive-Compulsive disorder in terms of maladaptive extreme Conscientiousness was discussed above. A feature of interest here is that this disorder appears in a class of its own in the FFM description.

58. People who learned to drive many years ago were taught that if they needed to stop the car on a slippery surface, the safest way was to slowly, gently pump the brake. Today most new cars have anti-lock brakes. To stop on a slippery surface, now the safest thing to do is to step on the brake firmly and hold it down. Most of us caught on ice will still gently pump the brakes. What was once a safety measure is now a dangerous act. The context has changed, but our behavior remains the same. If I see you pumping the brake and I know you should hold it down firmly, I may think you’re stupid. If I see you holding it down firmly and I learned to drive years ago, I may think you are stupid. A more accurate attribution in both cases, again, is mindlessness, not stupidity.

59. THE UBIQUITY OF MINDLESSNESS Why does it sometimes seem like there are so many stupid people out there? Because, much of the time, we are mindless. Of course we are unaware when we are in that state of mind—we are “not there” to notice. To notice, we would have had to have been mindful. Yet over twenty-five years of research reveals that mindlessness may be pervasive and very costly to us. In these studies we have found that an increase in mindfulness results in an increase in competence, health and longevity, positive affect, creativity, charisma, and reduced burnout, to name a few of the findings (for reviews of this work, see Langer 1989, 1997). When we are mindless, we are trapped in rigid mindsets, and we are oblivious to the context or perspective of the person we observe. When we are mindful we are actively drawing novel distinctions rather than relying on distinctions drawn in the past. This makes us sensitive to context and perspective. When we are mindless, our behavior is rule- and routine-governed. In contrast, when mindful, our behavior may be guided rather than governed by rules and routines.

60. Mindlessness comes about in one of two ways: either through repetition or by a cognitive commitment made on a single exposure to information. The first case is the more familiar. Most of us have had the experience, for example, of driving and then realizing, only because of the distance we have come, that we made part of the trip on “automatic pilot,” as we sometimes call mindless behavior. Another example of mindlessness through repetition is when we learn something by practicing it so that it becomes “second nature” to us. We try to learn the new skill so well that we don’t have to think about it. The problem is that if we’ve been successful, it won’t occur to us to think about it even when it would be to our advantage to do so.

61. We can also become mindless instantly, when we hear or see something and accept it without questioning it. Most of what we know about the world or ourselves we have mindlessly learned in this way. For example, when Susan was at a friend’s house for dinner and the table was set with the fork on the right side of the plate, she felt like some natural law had been violated. The fork “goes” on the left side! Susan knew this was ridiculous—it really doesn’t matter where the fork is placed. Yet it felt wrong to her, despite the fact that she could think of many reasons why it would be better to place the fork on the right. She thought about how she had learned that the fork belongs on the left side of the plate. She hadn’t memorized information about how to set a table. When Susan was a child, her mother simply said to her that the fork goes on the left. Forever after, that is where she was destined to put it, no matter what circumstances might suggest otherwise. Her behavior in this respect became fixed, and she was unaware that the information itself would remain fixed in the future.

62. Whether we become mindless over time or on initial exposure to information, we unwittingly lock ourselves into a single understanding of that information. For example, Susan had once learned that horses don’t eat meat. One day at an equestrian event someone asked her to watch his horse while he went to get the horse a hot dog. Susan shared her “fact” with the horse’s owner. She had learned the information in a context-free, absolute way and never thought to question whether it was true. This is the way we learn most things. It is why we are frequently in error but rarely in doubt. So, what happened? The owner got the hot dog anyway—and the horse ate it. When information is given by an authority, appears irrelevant to the problem at hand, or is presented in absolute language, it typically does not occur to us to question it. This is particularly important in situations where we make attributions about ourselves on the basis of cognitive commitments: “I was born stupid,” we might think upon reading the latest treatise on the genetic origins of intelligence after having performed poorly on the latest flavor of IQ test. Authorities are sometimes wrong or overstate their case, and what is irrelevant today may be relevant tomorrow. Nevertheless, virtually all the information we receive is given in absolute language. For example, a child may be told, “A family consists of a mommy, a daddy, and a child.” All is fine until Daddy leaves home. Then, just like where the fork goes, it won’t feel right to the child when told, “We are still a family.” Instead of using absolute language, if a parent told a child that one possible understanding of a family is a mother, father, and child, the problem might not arise if the circumstances change.

63. In an experiment conducted to test this, Benzion Chanowitz and Ellen Langer (Chanowitz & Langer 1981) gave people information about a perceptual disorder. Several of the groups were given a reason to think about the information they were to read. The target group was simply given the information. After taking tests and scoring them, all subjects concluded that they had the disorder. On follow-up tests that required abilities presumably stunted by the disorder, the target group performed less than half as well as the groups initially given a reason to think about the information they read. There was no difference in what subjects had learned about the disorder, only a difference in how they had learned it. Even when the context changes, our understanding of it does not. When we learn mindlessly, it does not occur to us to question the information when the context changes.

64. LANGUAGE AS A COGNITIVE TRAP Language too often binds us to a single perspective, with mindlessness as a result. As students of general semantics tell us, the map is not the territory.

65. In one of our studies (see Langer 1997), we introduced people to a novel object in either an absolute or conditional way. They were told that the object “is” or “could be” a dog’s chew toy. We then created a need for an eraser. The question we considered was: who would think to use the object as an eraser? The answer: only those subjects who were told that it “could be” a dog’s chew toy. The name of an object is only one way it can be understood. If we learn about it as if “the map and the territory” are the same thing, creative uses of the information will not occur to us. Most aspects of our culture currently encourage us to reduce uncertainty: we learn so that we will know what things are. This way of learning sets the stage for us to look and feel stupid once circumstances change and the facts we have learned are no longer to be trusted. Instead, we should consider exploiting the power of uncertainty so that we can learn what things can become.

66. The validity of information depends on the context in which it is embedded and understood. Even the “simple” facts we think we know have this property. If a student is asked “How much is the sum of one plus one?” it may be tempting to conclude that the student is stupid if her answer is not “Two.” Consider: “How much is one wad of chewing gum plus one wad of chewing gum?” Answer: “One wad of chewing gum.” If a person observes me and does not understand the reason for my behavior, that person will likely conclude that my behavior was stupid and that I should have known better.

67. When Researchers Conclude “Cognitive Incompetence” In the same way that we mindlessly learn our facts, researchers may mindlessly produce those facts. Many cognitive “biases” and “fallacies” that psychologists have uncovered through lengthy experimentation may reflect the mindless attributions of the observers (researchers) rather than the cognitive incapacities of the subject. For the past three decades, researchers have exposed the layperson’s purported stupidity by showing the way in which we misuse heuristics and arrive at “wrong” answers to contrived problems and decision scenarios. However, as we have already seen, what is correct from one perspective may be incorrect from another perspective. Consider the following inclusion fallacy. The inclusion rule states that if one class of events is logically subsumed under another class of events, then the probability of the inclusive class cannot be smaller than the probability of the included class. Consider the question “Which is more likely to happen—spilling coffee, or spilling hot coffee?” Many people will answer “Spilling hot coffee.” To those who know the inclusion rule and believe it is applicable in this case, these people may seem stupid. “Clearly,” they would argue, “the category ‘coffee’ includes hot coffee and iced coffee and coffee that we have allowed to run cold, so that spilling coffee includes spilling all forms of coffee including hot coffee. Therefore spilling coffee must be more likely than spilling hot coffee.” From this perspective, “Spilling coffee” is the right answer. One could, however, come to this “right” answer by a wrong line of reasoning. One person said that spilling coffee is more likely than is spilling hot coffee, and then explained that when you want hot coffee, you drink it right away, but “coffee” stays around longer, so there is more opportunity to spill it. It is also possible to come up with the “wrong” answer by another line of reasoning that is a relevant alternative to a straight application of the inclusion rule. One may handle the decision problem by dividing “coffee” into two categories—“hot coffee” and “every other kind of coffee”—rather than viewing “coffee” as one category that includes many different kinds of coffee. A person may assume that the “coffee” in question refers to any coffee that is not hot. The experimenter, after all, may have forgotten to label it specifically as non-hot coffee. By equating probabilities with frequencies (Gigerenzer 1996), the person then—correctly—reasons that she more frequently drinks hot coffee than she does cold, iced, or lukewarm coffee—and gives the normatively “stupid” answer: “hot coffee.” Nevertheless, she has reasoned by valid deductive steps from plausible premises—and can hardly be condemned as incompetent.

68. Similarly, cognitive science seems to be predicated on a whole set of results purporting to document the cognitive shortcomings of the layperson. It also usually extends these results, arguing that biases are “hardwired” (genetically determined) into our cognitive processes, which leads us to the paradoxical conclusion that the very people on whom we depend to use the rules of logic and the axioms of probability theory in order to produce objective knowledge are themselves subject to the same biases as those their experiments seem to support and document (Tversky & Kahneman 1982). “I,” the cognitive scientist seems to say, “am cognitively incompetent to render a judgment on my own cognitive capacity”—which is structurally similar to the paradox of the liar: “I am telling you a lie.”

69. A solution to this dilemma is to argue that experimental results can be interpreted in many different ways, some of which do not entail any kind of cognitive incapacity on the part of the participant. Take, for example, the famous “Linda” experiment that Tversky and Kahneman (1982) used to argue that people fail to obey the “conjunction rule” of the probability calculus. Participants are presented with a text that describes a young woman. She is described as having attended a liberal arts college, and as being bright and outspoken. The participants are then asked to rank, in order of likelihood of being correct, several one-sentence descriptions of “Linda.” One sentence (“Linda is a bank teller”) is meant to describe a class of objects (bank tellers) that includes bank tellers who dance, bank tellers who are active in the feminist movement, more generally bank tellers of any kind. Any sentence that begins with “Linda is a bank teller and is (something else)” should be ranked as less likely than the simple sentence “Linda is a bank teller,” because, by the conjunction rule, if two events are statistically independent, the probability that both events will be realized simultaneously is less than the probability that each event will be realized on its own. To test their application of the conjunction rule, participants to the experiment are also given the sentence (“Linda is a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement”) as one of the sentences which could be true of Linda. It is meant to be a “subsumed” sentence, which should, because of this status, be judged to have a lesser likelihood than the sentence “Linda is a bank teller.” Participants seemed to systematically ignore the conjunction rule, and most of them ranked the compound sentence as more likely to be a true description of Linda than the simple sentence. Moreover, they resisted experimenters’ attempts to “correct” this bias by teaching them the conjunction rule. One interpretation of these results is that people are simply unable—or hardwired—to break out of the conjunction fallacy. They are not only stupid for violating the rule but also bullheadedly stupid—for resisting attempts to teach the “right” approach to the rule. We (Moldoveanu & Langer 2001) have produced at least two alternative interpretations of the same findings that are (1) normatively “correct” (albeit according to different norms of reasoning), and (2) exculpatory of the verdict of Kahneman and Tversky. They run as follows: • First Interpretation: Subjects interpreted the problem as one of finding the description of Linda that is most likely to be true, given the description of Linda they were presented with in the opening paragraph. The textual description of Linda was the “evidence,” and the statements about Linda that they were asked to rank in order of likelihood were the “models” or hypotheses being tested against the evidence. They, in other words, acted as perfectly reasonable Bayesian statisticians, who wanted to maximize the posterior probability that the sentence they chose was a true description of Linda, given some prior probability about who Linda was and the “data” about Linda they were presented with. The relevance of the data to the theory is a key ingredient of the Bayesian conditionalization procedure (Jeffrey 1983). According to this interpretation, “Linda is a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement” can be reasonably judged to be more likely to be true than “Linda is a bank teller,” given that we already know that “Linda is bright, outspoken, and a former liberal arts major,” because the fact that Linda is an outspoken former liberal arts major is relevant to her being active in the feminist movement, whereas her being out-spoken and a former liberal arts major is not generally considered to be relevant to her being a bank teller. • Second Interpretation: In the second interpretation we advanced (Moldoveanu & Langer 1997), people are assumed to treat the experiment as a learning situation, and are using a logic of scientific discovery that calls for them to treat the various descriptions of Linda as hypotheses to be tested against a “data” set that includes the researcher’s feedback. Famously, Popper (1959) believed that the prior probability of any general statement is zero. He advised that we should test hypotheses with the greatest possible “empirical content” through our actions (i.e., we should pick the statement (a & b) over the statement (a) for testing purposes because compound hypotheses provide the greatest opportunity for a theory to be “falsified,” even though, from a probabilist standpoint, (a & b) will have a lower prior probability than will (a) or (b) alone). Thus, if participants in the “Linda” study behaved like Popperian scientists, they would pick, for testing purposes, the compound statement “Linda is a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement” over the statement “Linda is a bank teller” because they would be choosing the statement with the greatest empirical content, for testing purposes. It matters not that they were asked for the statement “Most likely to be true of Linda.” They may have simply encoded the statement as “The statement you would most want to test” in the situation at hand.

70. In their recent essay, Ron Ritchhart and David Perkins (2000) review several interventions aimed at making classroom interactions more mindful. They argue, for instance, that teaching elementary algebra to schoolchildren by starting from the epistemological foundations of knowledge of a number or of the result of an equation can increase the involvement of the students with the material presented. Their work aims to increase the cognitive “availability” of students in the classroom by including ability, sensitivity, and inclination (rather than ability or inclination alone) in the definition of a disposition that the “mindful classroom” could aim to cultivate. They show how students in mindful classrooms come to question problem statements, and in particular how the infamous “age of the captain is the sum of the numbers of animals” result gets reversed in a classroom schooled in the questioning ways that typify the mindfulness interventionist literature pioneered by Langer (1989).

Langer (1997) shows how each of the axioms of the teacher script can lead to counterproductive results in real life, and shows how each of the axioms can be uprooted by interventions aimed at cultivating mindfulness. She demonstrates how the conditional presentation of information (refuting the “learn the basics” axiom) can increase both enjoyment and performance; how varying the focus of attention (refuting the “focus on one thing at a time” axiom) can increase awareness and sensitivity to context; how getting people to mix work and play (refuting the “delay of gratification”) axiom can lead to greater enjoyment of and performance on a set of tasks; how unfreezing the pre-set ways in which knowledge has been learned (by presenting information in a disorganized way, contra the “forgetting is a problem” axiom) can increase the ingenuity and creativity of a solution to a specified problem; how introducing uncertainty into the presentation of information (refuting the “right and wrong answers” axiom) can increase people’s sense of control over a task. These challenges to the axioms of the teacher script are easy to replicate and implement in the classroom, give unambiguously positive results for the students, and call into question most—if not all—of the entrenched educational practices that characterize our education system. They are apt to turn the “teacher’s a jerk and he thinks I’m a fool” spiral of mutual deception and attribution of stupidity into a positive spiral where students and teachers push each other to deepen their understanding of the subject matter and of one another.

72. Stupidity as Mindlessness of the Actor We have thus far examined two contexts in which attributions of stupidity can be understood as processes reflecting the mindlessness of the observer: the cognitive science laboratory, where the participant is judged on the basis of a preselected interpretation of the “facts of the case,” and the classroom, where mutual attributions of stupidity can fuel an interpersonal, destructive, and deceptive spiral wherein teachers and students are individually reinforced in their respective attributions about one another’s cognitive incompetence. Now we turn to the process by which the actor herself internalizes the judgments of others about her performance, and turns the “attribution gun” upon herself, arriving at the verdict “I am stupid” on the basis of perceived reactions that others have to her behavior and work.

73. People’s beliefs about their own cognitive efficacy can—not surprisingly—be raised or lowered by presenting them with information about the cognitive performance of other people (Davis & Yates 1982). Thus, despite the famous propensity of people to make “situational” attributions for their own failures and dispositional attributions for the failures of others (Nisbett & Ross 1980), they also readily take in the “verdicts” of the external world when it comes to interpreting performance results on tasks that are meaningful to them.

   - Page: 318

74. What kind of attribution will make one mindful about being stupid? It is well known that most people respond to constructive criticism (Baron 1988) with an increased sense of self-efficacy, and to disparaging criticism with a decreased feeling of self-efficacy. The difference between constructive and disparaging criticism is precisely that the former makes statements about the performance of the individual that leave open the possibility of improvement the next time that individual attempts to perform the task. It is precisely the difference between a mindless cognitive commitment that fore-closes possibilities (“I screwed up—therefore I’m stupid”) and a mindful attribution that leaves open the possibility of improvement (“Under these conditions, I achieved these results—here are some possible hypotheses about the links between my effort, these conditions, and my performance”). The attribution “I did not sing well this time around because of . . .” leads to very different emotions about oneself than the attribution “I’m not a good singer.”

   - Page: 318

75. conditional learning stresses the particular conditions under which an attribution is valid and therefore focuses the attention of the actor on the particular circumstances that led to a mismatch between her expectations and her results.
   - Location: 4875-4877
   - Page: 318

76. The mindful individual, in contrast, is one who “shapes reality by identifying several possible perspectives from which any situation may be viewed” (Langer 1997). The innovation of the mindful kicks in before the assumptions, or the problem statement itself, has been determined. Mindfulness rests on the Bergsonian insight that we should consider not the ways in which people resolve problems and the validity of their answers, but rather on the kinds of problems they choose to resolve (Deleuze 1990). Mindfulness, then, refers not to a finite capacity for consistency checks, but rather to a process or phenomenon by which new thought-shapes (ideas, categories, mental images) that organize perception are generated. Mindlessness refers to the unquestioning acceptance of any one set of constraints or axioms that algorithmically “determine” the problem-solving steps one needs to take in order to produce the desired behavior. Mindfulness and mindlessness cannot, therefore, be traded off linearly against each other. The moment we have accepted—unconditionally—a set of constraints or objectives, we have ceased to become mindful and have instead become mindless.
   - Location: 4918-4926
   - Page: 321

77. Mindfulness also bears an interesting link to the theory of multiple intelligences developed by Howard Gardner (1991). Gardner’s significant contribution is to extend the classical, linear notion of intelligence to multiple dimensions, so that many different cognitive and emotional skills and traits can be positively counted as intelligence-enhancing factors. While the idea of multiple intelligences represents a great advance over the concept of a single intelligence, each individual kind of intelligence, however, remains defined as an optimal-plan or optimal-activity-producing capability, starting from a particular problem statement or kind of problem statement. However, as the number of possible different kinds of intelligence becomes infinitely large, different problem formulations begin to morph into one another, leading to different ways of conceptualizing the world, different categories for organizing perceptions, and different links between words and objects, in which case infinitely multiple intelligences are a form of mindfulness. The interesting consequence of this extension to the stupidity/ mindlessness discussion we have carried out above is that the replacement of intelligence—even of multiple intelligences—with mindfulness leads to the exclusion of “stupidity” as a meaningful term from public discourse. Since we can admit to being mindless far more easily than to being stupid, this replacement has the happy consequence of promoting the kind of constructive self-criticism and mutual criticism that breeds greater control and a sense of competence in dealing with the world.

78. The imbalance theory of foolishness builds on my earlier balance theory of wisdom (Sternberg 1998). The proposed theory views foolishness as the opposite of wisdom. The large majority of behaviors that we refer to as stupid are not stupid as opposed to intelligent, but, rather, foolish as opposed to wise. The beginnings of foolishness lie in a defect in tacit knowledge.
   - Location: 4998-5001
   - Page: 326

79. THE NATURE OF TACIT KNOWLEDGE The view of foolishness proposed here has at its core defects in the acquisition or utilization of tacit knowledge (Polanyi 1976). Tacit knowledge can be defined as action-oriented knowledge, usually acquired without direct help from others, that allows individuals to achieve goals they personally value (Sternberg et al. 1995; Sternberg et al. 2000). Tacit knowledge has three main features: it is procedural; it is relevant to the attainment of goals people value; and it is acquired with little or no help from others.
   - Location: 5001-5006
   - Page: 327

80. When we refer to tacit knowledge as being procedural, and as intimately related to action, we are viewing it as a form of “knowing how” rather than of “knowing that” (Ryle 1949).
   - Location: 5006-5007
   - Page: 327

81. Tacit knowledge also is practically useful. It is instrumental to the attainment of goals people value. Thus, people use this knowledge in order to achieve success in life, however they may define success. Abstract academic knowledge about procedures for solving problems with no relevance to life would not be viewed, in this perspective, as constituting tacit knowledge. Finally, tacit knowledge is acquired without direct help from others.

82. people in positions of great power often acquire three dispositions that dispose them to foolishness: a sense of omniscience, a sense of omnipotence, and a sense of invulnerability.
   - Location: 5032-5033
   - Page: 329

83. Wisdom involves a balancing not only of the three kinds of interests, but also of three possible courses of action in response to this balancing: adaptation of oneself or others to existing environments; shaping of environments in order to render them more compatible with oneself or others; and selection of new environments. In adaptation, the individual tries to find ways to conform to the existing environment that forms his or her context. Sometimes adaptation is the best course of action under a given set of circumstances. But typically one seeks a balance between adaptation and shaping, realizing that fit to an environment requires not only changing oneself, but changing the environment as well. When an individual finds it impossible or at least implausible to attain such a fit, he or she may decide to select a new environment altogether, leaving, for example, a job, a community, or a marriage.
   - Location: 5104-5110
   - Page: 333

84. Selection also can be foolish, as when older individuals leave good or at least acceptable marriages for much younger partners whose main goal appears to be to share the financial success of their newly found, more established partners.
   - Location: 5121-5123
   - Page: 334

85. Foolishness often results from knowledge acquisition gone awry or poorly utilized. The history of malevolent dictators such as Hitler shows that they rarely stop until they are stopped. Genghis Khan was not satisfied with what he would have perceived as half a loaf. Usually, the information is there to be had. The individual avoids seeking or fully processing the information that is so readily found, in what Moldoveanu and Langer (in Chapter 10 of this volume) refer to as “mindlessness.”
   - Location: 5144-5147
   - Page: 336

86. The costs of foolishness can be very high. In order to avoid it, we first need to understand it. Such an understanding can be achieved by viewing foolishness as an imbalance that results from feelings of omniscience, omnipotence, and invulnerability.

## Consciousness and the Social Brain
**Author:** Michael S. A. Graziano

### Highlights (15)

1. Consciousness is the window through which we understand.
   - Location: 72-72
   - Page: 5

2. The first known scientific account relating consciousness to the brain dates back to Hippocrates in the fifth century B.C.1 At that time, there was no formal science as it is recognized today. Hippocrates was nonetheless an acute medical observer and noticed that people with brain damage tended to lose their mental abilities. He realized that mind is something created by the brain and that it dies piece by piece as the brain dies.

3. For more than twenty years I studied how vision and touch and hearing are combined in the brain and how that information might be used to coordinate the movement of the limbs. I summarized much of that work in a previous book, The Intelligent Movement Machine, in 2008.13
   - Location: 151-153
   - Page: 10

4. The brain does two things that are of particular importance to the present theory. First, the brain uses a method that most neuroscientists call attention. Lacking the resources to processes everything at the same time, the brain focuses its processing on a very few items at any one time. Attention is a data-handling trick for deeply processing some information at the expense of most information. Second, the brain uses internal data to construct simplified, schematic models of objects and events in the world. Those models can be used to make predictions, try out simulations, and plan actions.
   - Location: 156-160
   - Page: 11

5. A specific network of brain areas in the cerebral cortex is especially active during social thinking, when people engage with other people and construct ideas about other people’s minds. Two brain regions in particular tend to crop up repeatedly in experiments on social thinking. These regions are called the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). I will have more to say about these brain areas throughout the book. When these regions of the cerebral cortex are damaged, people can suffer from a catastrophic disruption of awareness. The clinical syndrome is called neglect. It is a loss of awareness of objects on one side of space. While it can be caused by damage to a variety of brain areas, it turns out to be especially complete and long-lasting after damage to the TPJ or STS on the right side of the brain.1,2 Why should a person lose a part of his or her own awareness after damage to a part of the social machinery? The result is sometimes viewed as contradictory or controversial. But a simple explanation might work here. Maybe the same machinery responsible for attributing awareness to other people also participates in constructing one’s own awareness and attributing it to oneself.

6. The scheme has two components. The first component is the information about which I am aware. I am aware of the room around me, the sound of traffic from the street outside, my own body, my own thoughts and emotions, the memories brought up in my mind at the moment. All of these items are encoded in my brain as chunks of information. I am aware of a great diversity of information. The second component shown in the diagram is the act of being aware of the information. That, of course, is the mystery. Not all information in the brain has awareness attached to it. Indeed, most of it does not. Some extra thing or process must be required to make me aware of a specific chunk of information in my brain at a particular time.
   - Location: 227-232
   - Page: 15

7. I am going to give you a neuroscientist’s perspective: attention as a data-handling method in the brain. From now on, when I use the term attention, I will mean it in this technical, neuroscience sense. In Figure 2.5, the circles represent competing signals in the brain. These signals are something like political candidates in an election. Each signal works to win a stronger voice and suppress its neighbors. Attention is when one integrated set of signals rises in strength and outcompetes other signals. Each signal can gain a boost from a variety of sources. Strong sensory input, coming from the outside, can boost a particular signal in the brain (a bottom-up bias), or a high-level decision in the brain can boost a particular signal (a top-down bias). As a winning signal emerges and suppresses competing signals, as it shouts louder and causes the competition to hush, it gains a larger influence over other processing in the brain and, therefore, over behavior. Attending to an apple means that the neuronal representation of the apple grows stronger, wins the competition of the moment, and suppresses the representations of other stimuli. The apple representation can then more easily influence behavior.

   - Page: 24

8. Attention is not data encoded in the brain; it is a data-handling method. It is an act. It is something the brain does, a procedure, an emergent process. Signals compete with each other and a winner emerges—like bubbles rising up out of water. As circumstances shift, a new winner emerges. There is no reason for the brain to have any explicit knowledge about the process or dynamics of attention. Water boils but has no knowledge of how it does it. A car can move but has no knowledge of how it does it. I am suggesting, however, that in addition to doing attention, the brain also constructs a description of attention, a quick sketch of it so to speak, and awareness is that description.
   - Location: 380-385
   - Page: 25

9. A schema is a coherent set of information that, in a simplified but useful way, represents something more complex. In the present theory, awareness is an attention schema. It is not attention but rather a simplified, useful description of attention. Awareness allows the brain to understand attention, its dynamics, and its consequences.
   - Location: 385-387
   - Page: 26

10. if awareness is a schema that describes attention, then we should be able to find similarities between awareness and attention. These similarities have been noted before by many scientists.10–13 Here I am suggesting a specific reason why awareness and attention are so similar to each other: the one is the brain’s schematic description of the other. Awareness is a sketch of attention.
   - Location: 397-400
   - Page: 26

11. Here I am proposing that those nonphysical properties and other common properties ascribed to awareness are schematic, approximate descriptions of a real physical process. The physical process being modeled is something mechanistic and complicated and neuronal, a process of signal enhancement, the process of attention.
   - Location: 432-434
   - Page: 29

12. The brain contains specialized machinery that computes a description of someone else’s state of attention. It is part of the machinery for social thinking.17–21 Humans have an ability to monitor the gaze of others. We know where other people are looking. The scientific work on social attention, as it is sometimes called, has tended to limit itself to detecting someone else’s gaze direction.17,22–24 But I doubt that our sophisticated machinery for understanding other people’s attention is limited to vector geometry based on the eyes. Computing where someone else is looking is, in a sense, incidental. Computing someone else’s attentional state is a deeper task. I argue that we have a rich, sophisticated model of what attention is, of how it is deployed, of its temporal and spatial dynamics, of its consequences on action. A model of that type is essential to understanding and predicting another person’s behavior. Gaze direction is merely one visual cue that can help to inform that model. After all, blind people, with no visual cues about someone else’s gaze direction, still understand other people’s attention.

13. They are the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These areas are probably themselves collections of smaller, specialized subunits that presumably work in a cooperative fashion and interact with larger, brain-wide networks. I will describe the details of the TPJ and the STS in later chapters. Here I merely note in brief that they combine the three key properties predicted by the attention schema theory. First, these areas are recruited during social perception. Second, they track one’s own state of attention. Third, damage to them leads to a devastating clinical disruption of awareness.
   - Location: 495-499
   - Page: 33

14. If the theory is correct, then awareness is a description, a representation, constructed in the brain. The thing being represented is attention. But attention is the process of enhancing representations in the brain. We have a strange loop—a snake eating its own tail, or a hand drawing itself, so to speak. (Hofstadter coined the term “strange loop” in his 1979 book Godel, Escher, Bach27 and suggested that some type of strange loop might be at the root of consciousness.) In the present theory, awareness is a representation of the process that enhances representations. If that account is correct, then being aware of something and attending to it feed each other. The two are in a positive feedback loop: they are like two mirrors facing each other. Boost one and you boost the other. Damage one and you deflate the other. Attention cannot work fully without awareness, nor awareness without attention.

   - Page: 36

15. A long-standing question about consciousness is whether it is passive or active. Does it merely observe, or does it also cause? One of the more colorful metaphors on the topic was suggested by the philosopher Haidt.28 The unconscious machinery of the brain is so vast that it is like an elephant. Perhaps consciousness is a little boy sitting on the elephant’s head. The boy naïvely imagines that he is in control of the elephant, but he merely watches what the elephant chooses to do. He is a passive observer with a delusion of control. Alternatively, perhaps consciousness has the reins and is at least partially in control of the elephant. Is awareness solely a passive observer or also an active participant? The present theory comes down on the side of an active participant. Awareness is not merely watching, but plays a role in directing brain function.

## The Rise of Superman: Decoding the Science of Ultimate Human Performance
**Author:** Steven Kotler

### Highlights (8)

1. Csikszentmihalyi was able to sift through the data and isolate ten core components which demarcate the state. Here’s his list: Clear goals: Expectations and rules are discernible and goals are attainable and align appropriately with one’s skill set and abilities. Moreover, the challenge level and skill level should both be high. Concentration: A high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention. A loss of the feeling of self-consciousness: The merging of action and awareness. Distorted sense of time: One’s subjective experience of time is altered. Direct and immediate feedback: Successes and failures are apparent, so behavior can be adjusted as needed. Balance between ability level and challenge: The activity is neither too easy nor too difficult. A sense of personal control over the situation. The activity is intrinsically rewarding, so action is effortlessness. A lack of awareness of bodily needs. Absorption: narrowing of awareness down to the activity itself. Other researchers have since validated these ten categories and they stand as close to a working definition of flow as anyone has yet produced. Still, out of this total, three of the components—clear goals, immediate feedback, and the challenge/skill ratio (all of which we’ll explore in greater detail later)—are considered “conditions for flow.” They do not actually describe the state itself. Moreover, flow exists on a continuum, so not all of the remaining seven elements need to be present at the same time. Csikszentmihalyi uses the terms microflow and macroflow to explain these variations. In microflow, only a few of his categories are fulfilled—say clear goals, concentration, and absorption, or what would happen if Laird Hamilton paddled out for an afternoon of mellow Malibu surf. Macroflow, on the other hand, is what occurs when all of Csikszentmihalyi’s conditions arrive at once—it’s the full Teahupoo. Yet still missing in this description is the one element that truly sets flow apart: the creative, problem-solving nature of the state. Because flow requires action—otherwise action and awareness cannot merge—there’s decision making involved at every step.

2. “The prefrontal cortex is where thinking happens,” he explains. “It’s where we take simple ideas and add all kind of layers of complexity to them. But I was slipping into flow of a regular basis and always amazed by the clarity of the state. All that complexity was gone. Decisions were easy and automatic. It was like the opposite of thinking.”

3. in Mischel’s experiment, the kids who ate the marshmallow immediately were present hedonists. They lived for the now and not the later. It wasn’t that they were unable to delay gratification, it’s that not delaying gratification—the downstream result of being a present hedonist—was their strategy for living. And this strategy has an upside. As individuals, Presents are creative, spontaneous, open-minded, high-energy risk takers who play sports, have hobbies, make friends easily, and find lovers often. Their lives are fun-filled and fast-paced. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost. While Presents are often the life of the party, that’s often the end of the line. Because they act without anticipating consequences, don’t often learn from past failures, and are across the boards unable to resist temptation, attractions of the drugs and sex and rock-and-roll variety often derail their lives. A dominant present orientation has been correlated with mental health problems, juvenile delinquency, crime, and addictions. And when it comes to the long path toward mastery, with neither desire to plan nor long-term vision, Presents have a difficult time accumulating anything close to 10,000 hours of practice, deliberate or otherwise. On the other hand, kids who didn’t eat the marshmallow are future oriented, thus able to resist temptation today for a chance at a greater reward tomorrow. “Futures” have much to recommend them. In dozens and dozens of studies, they outperform Presents in most every category: they get better grades and more education, are healthier and more optimistic, make more money, solve problems more consistently, are more mindful of morality, and can make the best of failure. They are the movers and shakers in this world.
   - Location: 1644-1657
   - Page: 108

4. Obviously, Futures are more likely to achieve the 10,000 hours needed for mastery, but here too are unintentional consequences. Futures burn out. They become stressed-out workaholics. Blood pressure goes up, bowels get irritable, heart attacks increase, sex lives disintegrate, marriages fail, children become burdens, friends become memories, and the whole house of cards comes crashing down. So common is this experience that UCLA psychologist Steven Berglas has coined the term supernova burnout to describe the phenomenon. In other words, even when plans work out, Futures place a dangerous bet: too much delayed gratification can rob them of their motivation—which is the very thing that made them Futures in the first place. After three decades of research, Zimbardo found that the healthiest, happiest, highest performers blend the best of both worlds. The optimal time perspective combines the energy, joy, and openness of Presents, with the strength, fortitude, and long-term vision of the Futures.

5. Take external triggers, our starting point. These are qualities in the environment that drive people deeper into the zone. One tamer example comes from office design. In recent years, as the production of flow has been deemed critical to the success of organizations, organizations have reacted by trying to design environments that produce more flow. As flow requires focus, one of the first changes suggested by experts was the removal of cubicle farms, those open office plans that permit constant interruption. “These interruptions…move us out of ‘flow’ and increase research-and-design cycle times and costs dramatically,” writes Greylock Partners venture capitalist James Slavet on Forbes.com. “Studies have shown that each time a flow state is disrupted it takes fifteen minutes to get back into flow, if you can get back at all.”
   - Location: 1903-1908
   - Page: 125

6. While some danger must be courted for flow, confrontations with mortality are not required. In fact, even physical risk itself is optional. A shy man need only cross the room to say hello to an attractive woman to trigger this rush. In casual conversation, merely telling someone the truth can serve the same purpose. “To reach flow,” explains Harvard psychiatrist Ned Hallowell, “one must be willing to take risks. The lover must lay bare his soul and risk rejection and humiliation to enter this state. The athlete must be willing to risk physical harm, even loss of life, to enter this state. The artist must be willing to be scorned and despised by critics and the public and still push on. And the average person—you and me—must be willing to fail, look foolish, and fall flat on our faces should we wish to enter this state.” What all of this adds up to is options. Certainly, risk is needed for flow, but if you don’t want to take physical risks, take mental risks. Take social risks. Emotional risks. Creative risks. Especially creative risks. The application of imagination—one very shorthand definition of creativity—is all about mental chance taking. And the risk is real. Loss of respect, loss of resources, loss of time—the consequences of betting on a bad idea can certainly threaten survival.

7. “When you’re arrogant and egotistical,” says Dr. Olds, “you’re shutting out complexity, novelty, and unpredictability to preserve a distorted self-image. Any incoming information that could lead to self-doubt is stamped out. It’s a massive data reduction. Humility moves in the other direction, it opens us up and increases incoming information. As a result, there is more opportunity for pattern recognition, more dopamine, and less need for judgmental metacognition.”
   - Location: 2040-2044
   - Page: 134

8. But the most important piece, as University of Illinois cognitive scientist Daniel Simons discovered, is how clear goals impact attention. In 2003, Simons showed a short film of basketball players passing a ball around a court to his students, and asked them to count the passes. When the film was over, he had one question: “How many people saw the gorilla?” As it happened, midway through the clip, a guy in a gorilla costume walked to the middle of the circle of basketball players, beat his chest a few times, then walked off. As it happened, most of the students didn’t see the gorilla. Simon’s “invisible gorilla experiment” has since been repeated dozens of times—most recently with radiologists looking at radiological screens and a cartoon gorilla—and always with the same result. Not many people see the gorilla. In the radiologist’s version (a 2012 study run at Brigham and Woman’s Hospital in Boston), 83 percent of doctors tested failed to spot the animal. The point is this: when the brain is charged with a clear goal, focus narrows considerably, the unimportant is disregarded, and the now is all that’s left.

## Bacteria: The Benign, the Bad, and the Beautiful by Trudy M. Wassenaar (2011-12-30)
**Author:** Trudy M. Wassenaar

### Highlights (7)

1. A recent DNA puzzle in Germany illustrates some of the pitfalls of DNA forensics. An identical DNA fingerprint was obtained from various crime scenes all over the country, multiple years apart, which varied from minor burglaries to six cases of homicide, including the killing of a police officer. The DNA belonged to a woman, which made it an even more curious case. How could this “phantom female killer” be guilty of over 40 minor and major crimes geographically and temporally so dispersed and be so reckless to leave DNA behind as if she did not care? The puzzle was eventually solved when it became clear that the DNA recovered was not from the culprit but was the result of contamination of the cotton swabs used to take the samples. The woman who had manually packed these swabs, that were not suitable for forensic investigations as they were not guaranteed DNA-free, had left her genetic fingerprint. The German police found out the hard way that saving money by buying cheap swabs is not a good idea.

2. a gene is a segment of DNA that bears the information to produce a particular product. In most cases the gene product is a protein, whereby an RNA molecule is produced as an intermediate. Sometimes, as in ribosomal RNA, the RNA is the final product.

3. penicillin, the first antibiotic that was discovered and used in medicine, specifically inhibits the interconnection of peptidoglycan polymers, by inhibiting the specific enzyme that makes the connections. It means that penicillin does not affect an existing cell wall, but in its presence bacteria can no longer produce new, stable cell walls, so they can no longer grow. Penicillin does not kill as much as it prevents bacterial growth. This is sufficient to treat an acute infection, since the defenses of our own body can soon take a lead when the pathogen is no longer multiplying. It is even known how exactly penicillin inhibits the cross-linking of peptido-glycan. Its chemical structure contains a “lactam” group (penicillin belongs to the antibiotic family of beta-lactams). This allows it to bind to the target enzyme after which it gets stuck like a wrong key in a lock: it will not let go of the enzyme.

4. The invention of paper is credited to a Chinese court official, Tsai Lun (also written as Ts’ai Louen), around the year 105 AD. In the eighth century, it was produced by Arabs in the Middle East, from where it spread to Europe. The Arabs introduced linen into the raw materials and built paper mills to scale up production. By the twelfth century, paper was the most common writing material in Europe. Paper consists mainly of cellulose, and as demand grew, wood became its raw material. The Mayans also wrote on a kind of paper, produced from the bark of fig (Ficus) trees. High quality paper required the addition of minor amounts of starch or gelatin to reduce the spread of ink, as well as dyes and pigments and, later still, whitening agents.

5. The shelf life of photos and magnetic tapes is shorter than that of paper, and recent paper products are less resistant to degradation than early paper, which loses again, in terms of long-lasting duration, to parchment and papyrus. The safest way to store valuable information for centuries and millenniums are still clay tablets. Those are indigestible even for bacteria.

6. Every human cell has the same set of approximately 23,000 genes, whereas the complete microbiome (the combined genomes of all our bacteria) of one individual easily adds up to a million different genes.

7. Some restrictions to the recombinant technique become apparent only when experiments leave the drawing table and enter the reagent glass. The protein we force bacteria to produce should not be toxic to them, but toxicity cannot always be predicted with accuracy. Likewise, the bacteria should not produce proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) that attack the harvest. Finally, and crucially, the protein produced should leave the bacterial cell, so that it does not build up inside the cell (with likely toxic effects) but is released in the liquid medium for easy recovery. Protein secretion is a complex process in a cell. Proteins cannot pass the membrane or membranes that surround the cell without being actively transported. Specific secretion systems have evolved to sluice proteins out of cells, of which the TTSS has already been introduced (see Chapter 5). There are at least six different types of secretion systems produced by bacteria, and each can transport only particular proteins across the membrane. Most of these systems secrete proteins into the medium, whereas the TTSS is special in that it ejects the proteins into target cells. Typically, a secretion system recognizes which protein has to leave the cell because this protein carries a label: a secretion signal, usually a short segment of amino acids in a particular order. This label is recognized by the specific secretion system in the membrane of the cell. The artificially introduced eukaryotic protein will most likely not contain such a bacterial secretion label, so that has to be added to its gene by genetic engineering, or else the protein would get stuck inside the bacterial cell.

### Highlights (6)

1. All great science, indeed all fruitful thinking, must occur in a social and intellectual context—and contexts are just as likely to promote insight as to constrain thought. History does not unfold along a line of progress, and the past was not just a bad old time to be superseded and rejected for its inevitable antiquity.

4. The Linnaean system implies a definite geometry for the ordering of objects, and therefore only works when the causes of order produce results conforming with this geometry. Consider two essential properties: First, the Linnaean system is hierarchical. The basic units (species) are grouped into genera, genera into families, families into orders, and so on. This scheme implies a treelike topology with the largest unit (say, the kingdom Animalia) as a single trunk; middle units as large boughs attached to the trunk (phyla like Arthropoda and Chordata); smaller units as branches emerging from the boughs (classes like Mammalia and Aves joined to the chordate bough); and, finally, basic units as twigs growing from the branches (species like Homo sapiens and Gorilla gorilla attached to the primate branch of the mammalian bough of the animal trunk). This topology correctly represents a system of objects produced by branching evolution, with continuous divergence and no suturing together of separately formed branches. Since the history of life operates by this geometry, the Linnaean system works splendidly for classifying organisms. Second, basic units must be discrete and definable, not smoothly intergrading and constantly joining. Since organic species are independent and stable units (after the brief geological moment of their branching origin), the Linnaean system also functions ideally for complex, sexually reproducing organisms. But the same reasons that allow the Linnaean system to classify fossil organisms so well also guarantee an inapplicability in principle to the two categories of the mineral kingdom that Mendes da Costa’s age also called “fossils”—minerals and rocks. Minerals and their crystals have definite chemical formulae, and aggregate by simple physical rules. Their relative similarities are not genealogical, and their order cannot therefore be expressed by a treelike geometry. Moreover, mineral “species” are not discrete entities composed of genealogically related individuals in historical continuity. Cambrian quartz, at half a billion years of age, does not differ from Pleistocene quartz separately made in a geological yesterday. Rocks and soils, composed of mineral grains and the products of their erosion, fail the Linnaean requirements for an even more fundamental reason. Rocks and soils form a broad continuum of fully intergrading compositions. We cannot identify discrete species of granites, marbles, or chalks. Granites, for example, are composed of quartz, two kinds of feldspar, and a dark mineral like biotite or hornblende—and all these constituents can be mixed and matched like house paint into any desired composition.

5. Theory and fact are equally strong and utterly interdependent; one has no meaning without the other. We need theory to organize and interpret facts, even to know what we can or might observe. And we need facts to validate theories and give them substance.

6. No great and new study has ever developed without substantial error, and we need only cite a famous line from Darwin: “False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness.”

2. Weber-Drohl was followed by Hermann Goetz, a Hamburg lawyer turned spy who the Abwehr thought could find his way about enemy territory "with the certainty of a sleepwalker." He would prove to be less sure-footed than that; in fact, he would be described as "the most inept and, even worse, the unluckiest of all spies in history." Goetz, a gentleman Canaris at Work ) 211 ( with fine instincts, landed by parachute (on his third try) from a Heinkel III, on a mission that "had some connection with an unpractical plan, codenamed Kathleen, for a German invasion of (Eire); this had been submitted to the Abwehr in Hamburg by an emissary of the IRA." His misfortunes began immediately. He landed not in Eire but in Ulster, and he could not bury his Luftwaffe uniform because he had lost his spade—along with his wireless—in the drop. Still in uniform, he set out to walk the 70 miles across wild country to the point where he should have landed, but the batteries of his flashlight, which was marked "Made in Dresden," soon gave out, and while he carried a good deal of money—an OSS report said the equivalent of $200,000 in British and Irish notes—he went hungry because he was not aware that both were currency in Eire and Ulster. He was then compelled to swim the Boyne "with great difficulty since the weight of my fur combination exhausted me," he wrote afterwards, adding plaintively: "This swim also cost me my invisible ink." He finally discarded his uniform and "I was now in high boots, breeches and jumper, with a little black beret on my head. ... I kept my military cap as a vessel for drinks and my war medals for sentimental reasons." Peter Fleming would later write of this episode: "The lonely, brave, baffled figure trudging across the empty Irish landscape in jackboots, with a little black beret on his head and a pocket full of 1914-18 medals, is a reminder of how far the German intelligence effort fell short of those standards of subtlety and dissimulations which were expected of it. . . ." Eventually, Goetz found himself at a safehouse in Dublin owned by Stephen Held, an IRA figure who was, at the time, believed also to be in Menzies's service. But a few days after Goetz's arrival, the house was raided by IRA men who stole all his money. On May 22, 1940, the house was again raided, this time by the police. Held was detained and Goetz vanished over the garden wall into Dublin, leaving behind what remained of his espionage equipment. The police—possibly at British instigation— put <£3000 on his head, and he was betrayed by the IRA, caught and jailed. As he was about to be handed over to the British, he bit into the last remnant of his Abwehr equipment—a cyanide capsule—and died complaining that the IRA was "rotten to its very core."

3. As the battle proceeded for mastery above and below the sea, Ultra was making another major contribution to victory over the Third Reich— the destruction of the German weather intelligence gathering and reporting system. Both the Allies and the Germans recognized that attack as well as defense along that most treacherous of Europe's waterways, the English The Battle of the Atlantic ) 263 ( Channel, would be influenced to an important extent by the weather. Cloud cover, wind velocity, tides, wave heights—all could affect, seriously disrupt, or even prevent the complex land, sea and air operations of an assault on France. As Eisenhower would write, perhaps recalling the fate of the Spanish Armada in the Channel in 1588: "If really bad weather should endure permanently, the Nazi would need nothing else to defend the Normandy coast!" Accurate weather forecasts, therefore, were vital to the Allied command and the Germans alike, and it was imperative to deny the Germans as much weather information as possible. Thus a series of systematic and unsung battles were fought between the Allies and the Germans in the remote latitudes of the North Atlantic where the Channel's weather was made. They were battles as fierce and violent as those fought in any other sphere of action; they began the moment the war broke out, and they ended only when the war itself ended.

4. There were many queer twists in the weather war, for not only were the Germans deprived of accurate weather intelligence, a campaign was also launched to provide them with false and misleading forecasts. The campaign began the moment the war broke out when the double agent Snow broadcast from his jail cell false reports of the weather over London to throw Hitler off if he decided to commence hostilities with a Luftwaffe attack on the British capital. It continued when German agents trying to infiltrate the North Atlantic islands to set up weather-reporting stations were captured, "turned" and began to supply Berlin with false weather data. XX-Committee double agents in Britain also supplied their controllers with false weather intelligence.

## Reckoning With Risk: Learning to Live With Uncertainty
**Author:** Gerd Gigerenzer

### Highlights (47)

1. The general disposition to uncritically accept such a belief is not unfounded when beliefs involve food, health, or other things that directly concern survival. Here, illusory certainty seems to be an adaptive response that for ages has protected humans, especially children, from trying to learn first-hand about possible dangers, such as which kinds of food are poisonous and which are not. Similarly, young children are prepared to believe in values, rules, and stories without question, which facilitates their integration into their social group and culture. Social conventions—whether learned from one's family or one's wider culture—are, like elementary perception, a source of the illusion of certainty.

2. In general, overcoming nonage can mean detecting holes in stories, facts, and values in which one has always believed. Questioning certainties often means questioning social authority. Learning to live with uncertainty is a daring task for individuals as well as societies. Much of human history has been shaped by people who were absolutely certain that their kin, race, or religion was the one most valued by God or destiny, which made them believe they were entitled to get rid of conflicting ideas along with the bodies polluted with them. Modern societies have come a long way toward greater tolerance of uncertainty and diversity. Nevertheless, we are still far from being the courageous and informed citizens whom Kant envisaged—a goal that can be expressed in just two Latin words: Sapere aude.

3. The statement “there is a 30 percent chance that it will rain tomorrow” is a probability statement about a singular event—it will either rain or not rain tomorrow. In contrast, the statement that it will rain on 10 days in May is a frequency statement. The latter statement can be true or false; a single-event probability by itself, however, can never be proven wrong (unless the probability is zero or one). Single-event probabilities can lead to miscommunication because people tend to fill in different reference classes. This happens even with such familiar statements as “there is a 30 percent chance that it will rain tomorrow.” Some think this statement means that it will rain 30 percent of the time, others that it will rain in 30 percent of the area, and a third group believes it will rain on 30 percent of the days that are like tomorrow. These three interpretations are about equally frequent.14 What weather forecasters actually have in mind is the last interpretation. However, people should not be blamed for different interpretations; the statement “there is a 30 percent chance that it will rain tomorrow” is ambiguous.

4. Absolute risk reduction: The absolute risk reduction is the proportion of patents who die without treatment (placebo) minus those who die with treatment. Pravastatin reduces the number of people who die from 41 to 32 in 1,000. That is, the absolute risk reduction is 9 in 1,000, which is 0.9 percent. Relative risk reduction: The relative risk reduction is the absolute risk reduction divided by the proportion of patients who die without treatment. For the present data, the relative risk reduction is 9 divided by 41, which is 22 percent. Thus, pravastatin reduces the risk of dying by 22 percent. Number needed to treat: The number of people who must participate in the treatment to save one life is the number needed to treat (NNT). This number can be easily derived from the absolute risk reduction. The number of people who needed to be treated to save one life is 111, because 9 in 1,000 deaths (which is about 1 in 111) are prevented by the drug.

7. Does early detection imply mortality reduction? Not in all cancers. Early detection can, but need not, lead to mortality reduction. For instance, if there is no effective therapy, early detection has no effect on mortality. Here, early detection does not increase life expectancy, but only the time the patient consciously has to live with the cancer.

8. Do all breast cancers progress? No. Mammography can detect a form of breast cancer that is called “ductal carcinoma in situ.” Most cancers found in the screening of younger women are ductal carcinomas in situ. Although their clinical course is not well understood, half or more of the lesions do not seem to progress.
   - Location: 867-870
   - Page: 57

9. Is early detection always a benefit? No. For instance, when a cancer does not progress or progresses so slowly that it has no effect during a woman's life, early detection does not help this woman. Rather, she will suffer harm without benefits: Most likely she will undergo invasive treatment, such as mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation, and her quality of life will substantially decrease.
   - Location: 870-872
   - Page: 57

10. Relative risks do not carry information about the absolute benefits of a treatment: For example, a 25 percent reduction means many lives saved if the disease is frequent, but only a few if the disease is rare. Transparent risk communication can be achieved by means of absolute risks, number needed to treat, and increases in life expectancy.
   - Location: 915-917
   - Page: 60

11. Transparency can also be achieved by expressing the benefit of a treatment in terms of a more familiar situation. For instance, participating in annual mammography screening that affords a 25 percent risk reduction has roughly the same effect on life expectancy as reducing the distance one drives each year by 300 miles.

12. Repeated mammograms. What about women who undergo mammography regularly, that is, annually or biennially? After undergoing a series of 10 annual or biennial mammograms, 1 in 2 women without breast cancer can expect to receive at least one false positive result.22

14. In the United States, prostate cancer is more frequent than breast cancer (Figure 5–2). It also takes almost as many lives. But there is no anxiety among men about prostate cancer comparable to women's anxiety about breast cancer. Interestingly, unlike breast cancer, prostate cancer is presented in the media as an old person's disease. However, its incidence, mortality rate, and the mean age at diagnosis are in fact very similar to those of breast cancer.47 Colorectal cancer is the third most deadly cancer among women (after lung and breast cancer).

15. Averages were, for Bernard, no substitute for the laws that determine each individual case, and a true determinist would settle for nothing less. The way to discover these laws, in this view, was by experimentation, not the use of statistics. In the nineteenth century, statistical data were still considered antithetical to the scientific method. Whereas science was about certainty, statistics was about uncertainty; therefore, statistics was not a proper scientific tool. The German-Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis's statistical studies of childbed fever and scurvy are as legendary as the reluctance of the relevant authorities to enact the preventive measures that his statistics suggested. Unlike in physics, statistical thinking emerged slowly in medical diagnosis and treatment. The distinction that Bernard drew between statistics and experimentation was finally closed in the 1920s and 1930s, when the English statistician Sir Ronald Fisher united statistics and experiment into what he called the “scientific method.” The medical statistician Austin Bradford Hill pioneered the application of Fisher's randomized control experiments to randomized trials in medicine and was knighted for this achievement in 1961. Praised for its “concern for the welfare of the individual,” his work reconciled medical statistics with experimentation, thereby reconciling the aggregate with the individual.

18. as Professor M points out, informed consent must also entail the physician's revealing when his or her own costs and benefits concerning a treatment differ from those of the patient.

20. Division of labor. First, there is a division of labor, which can obstruct the flow of information. Radiologists who perform mammography examinations typically do not find out whether a patient later develops cancer. Most health care systems do not monitor and disseminate follow-up information, and there is little incentive for physicians to try tracking down the numbers themselves. This explanation applies to radiologists, such as Dr. Best, but not, however, to gynecologists, who do see the relevant information.
   - Location: 1810-1814
   - Page: 119

21. Legal and financial incentive structure. The second reason concerns professional fear and pride, and the legal and financial incentives associated with it. The error physicians fear most is to miss a cancer—the emotional distress at having had the power to detect a cancer and missing the opportunity. A miss can damage their reputation;; fellow physicians may take notice. Equally important, a miss also makes them vulnerable to being sued. Erring on the side of overestimating the chances of cancer protects physicians from being sued because it means they will rarely miss one. At the same time, this policy brings in more revenue to hospitals and private practices, owing to additional diagnoses and treatment. The costs of this policy—a large number of false positives and their potential physical, psychological, and monetary costs to the patient —vanish in the face of the physician's fear of missing a cancer. As the organizer of the earlier discussion mentioned, female patients are generally grateful for false positives. However, women might be less grateful for what turn out to be false positives (and less terrified to begin with) if they were informed that some 9 out of 10 women who test positive in screening do not have breast cancer in the first place.
   - Location: 1814-1823
   - Page: 119

22. Conflicts of interest. The third reason is various conflicts of interest. A breast cancer specialist told me that he no longer routinely recommends that women visit a radiologist just “because it is time and every woman should go.” Instead, he decided to inform each woman about the benefits and costs of mammography screening so that she can make a reasoned decision as to whether and when to participate. When he spoke to a radiologist friend over dinner about his change in policy, the friend got so upset that he dropped his knife and fork, stood up to leave the restaurant, and exclaimed, “Where did you get these numbers?” “From several hundred thousand women studied in America, Sweden, and other countries,” was the reply. “In America,” the radiologist exclaimed in anger, “they don't know how to read mammograms!” But his problem in reality was not with America; it was economic. For years, he had screened the women whom breast cancer specialists had sent to him. If half of the women were to decide not to participate in screening or to begin participating at a later age, the radiologist would face financial ruin. I admire the breast cancer expert for his willingness to risk losing outraged friends for the sake of informing his patients.

23. Innumeracy. Last but not least, there is innumeracy. Many physicians are poorly educated in statistical thinking and have little incentive to engage in this alien form of reasoning. If patients start to look up numbers, physicians might be forced to do so too.

24. When is a test result declared positive? HIV testing typically involves the following sequence. The first test, called the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay), is designed to detect antibodies against HIV in blood samples. It was originally used to screen donated blood, where maximizing test sensitivity (the true positive rate)—at the cost of an increased false positive rate—was imperative. If the result is negative, then the client is notified that he or she is HIV-negative. If the result is positive, then at least one more ELISA (preferably from a different manufacturer) is conducted on the sample. If the result is still positive, a Western blot test, which is more expensive and time-consuming to conduct than ELISA, is performed. If the Western blot is also positive, the client is notified that he or she is HIV-positive. In some cases, a second blood sample is obtained and analyzed before the client is notified.2 The exact procedure varies across institutions and countries.

25. Some of the problems associated with finding a cure can be illustrated by a comparison with the syphilis epidemic in the early part of the twentieth century. The syphilis campaigns closely paralleled today's AIDS campaigns. There were educational programs to reduce high-risk sexual behavior, scare tactics were spread through the media, and serological testing was made mandatory before one could obtain a marriage license in certain states in the United States. All of these measures, however, had little effect on the spread of the epidemic. By the 1930s, almost 1 in 10 Americans was infected with syphilis. The syphilis epidemic was finally brought under control—not by changes in human sexual behavior, but by the discovery of penicillin, a cheap and effective drug.

26. Screening for HIV is most important for high-risk groups. Although the possibility of therapy is very limited because of the relentless course of the disease, there is another reason for screening. Early detection can reduce the prevalence of HIV. Recall that mammography does not reduce prevalence, only mortality. HIV, however, is different because it is transmitted from person to person. Early detection can reduce the spread of the virus, and thereby its prevalence, if the infected persons disclose their status to their sexual partners and take precautions.

27. The following model session illustrates how a counselor could communicate the meaning of a positive test transparently. Model Session The counselor is trained in communicating risks in natural frequencies. Sensitivity? The test will be positive for about 998 of 1,000 people infected with HIV. Depending on circumstances, such as the specific tests used, this estimate can vary. False positives? About 1 in 10,000. False positives can be reduced by repeated testing (ELISA and Western blot), but not completely eliminated. They are caused by certain medical conditions as well as by laboratory errors. Prevalence? About 1 in 10,000 heterosexual men with low-risk behavior is infected with HIV. Positive predictive value? Think of 10,000 low-risk men like you. One is infected and will test positive with practical certainty. Of the 9,999 noninfected men, 1 will also test positive. Thus we expect that out of 2 men who test positive, only 1 has HIV. This is the situation you would be in if you were to test positive; your chance of having the virus would be about 1 in 2.21 Depending on the region and risk behavior, the numbers can be adjusted accordingly.

28. attorneys and DNA experts tend to talk about the uncertainties involved in DNA fingerprinting in terms of probabilities. As described in the preceding chapter, the random match probability is the FIGURE 10–1. The chain of uncertain inference in DNA typing: from reported match to guilt. (After Koehler, Chia & Lindsay, 1995.) probability that a person randomly selected from a population would match the trace evidence as closely as the suspect. The source probability, in contrast, is the probability that the suspect is actually the source of the recovered trace evidence. The guilt probability is yet something else, because, as mentioned above, even if the suspect is the source of the trace, he may not have committed the crime. The confusion of the random match probability with the other two probabilities leads to two errors. The source probability error occurs when someone overlooks the first two steps of the inferential chain and wrongly infers the source probability directly from the random match probability,

29. Let us have a closer look at the first step in the inferential chain, “Reported match.” If a match is declared, the only error that can be introduced at that step in the inferential process is a false positive result, that is, a match is reported although no true match exists. False positives do occur;

Simpson's DNA and DNA extracted from a recovered blood stain at the murder scene, reported its own false positive rate to the Simpson defense as roughly 1 in 200.14 What causes false positives?

33. The category effect is not limited to forecasting violence. It has been observed in judgments concerning events other than risks, such as in reports about innocuous habits and behaviors.10 The effect seems to occur in situations that involve uncertainty, such as when a person has limited knowledge and is asked to report or predict behavior. A category effect would not occur in situations where people have, or believe they have, definite knowledge, such as when a person is asked “How many kids do you have?” Here, the person would simply scan the scale in search of the right number. Situations that involve some degree of uncertainty, however, are abundant. One such situation is survey studies, in which respondents are asked to report their behavior by selecting a category. For instance, Norbert Schwarz and his colleagues asked German adults how many hours a day they spend watching TV on a typical day.11 The researchers gave one group of participants a response scale with six categories “up to ½ hour; ½ to 1 hour; 1 to 1½ hours;… more than 2½ hours.” This was called the “low-category” scale. A second group was given a high-category scale on which the six categories were “up to 2½ hours; 2½ to 3 hours;… more than 4 hours.” The choice of categories influenced people's reports of how much time they spent watching TV. For instance, 16 percent of the participants given the low-category scale said they watched more than 2½ hours per day. Among those given the high-category scale, 38 percent reported doing so. This is a remarkable phenomenon, and it once more demonstrates how judgments are influenced by the choice of the category scale. Similarly, the reported frequency of sexual behaviors, of consumer behaviors, and of physical symptoms is influenced by the categories given to the respondent.12 These results highlight the dangers of taking survey data at face value—even when people are not lying or trying to give answers that reflect favorably on themselves. The category effect is a quite general phenomenon that affects judgments of risk and more. What is the explanation for the category effect? A necessary condition seems to be that people be uncertain about what the answer to the question really is. People do not keep records of the number of hours they watch TV. When asked to estimate this number given their incomplete knowledge, they can use the response categories as a clue to guide them.

34. Someone who thinks herself an average TV watcher will tend to choose a category in the middle of the range, whatever that range may be. Similarly, a psychiatrist who is uncertain about how the risk of violent behavior is distributed in a population of patients will tend to distribute his judgments over the response categories, assuming that the categories reflect the true range of the behavior in the population. The professional, just as the TV watcher does, acts on the assumption that the researcher knows the range in the general population and has chosen the categories appropriately. Using their social intelligence, they both make the seemingly reasonable inference that the researcher's choice of response categories is relevant to what they have been asked to do. Survey researchers or public relations agencies, however, who want to produce results that are favorable to their economic, social, or political position can easily exploit the category effect and produce results in the direction they would like to see. The measurement instrument is not a neutral mirror of an underlying belief; instead, it becomes part of the judgment. How can the category effect be reduced in assessments of risk? There are two ways. The first is to reduce the uncertainty in the minds of risk assessors, for instance, by providing them with statistical information about the actual violent behavior of inmates on parole or patients on weekend release. As their knowledge increases, their uncertainty diminishes, and the category effect will eventually disappear. A second way is to dispense with response categories and use other tools for risk assessment, for example, an open-ended response format: “Think of 100 patients like Mr. Jones. How many will turn violent within six months?___out of 100.” In general, laypeople and experts need to take the category effect into account when interpreting forecasts and survey responses.

35. For each program, one proposal reported relative risk reduction, the second absolute risk reduction, the third the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one death, and the fourth the proportion of “event-free” (that is, surviving) patients. Table 12–1 shows data about the relative effectiveness of coronary artery bypass surgery (the cardiac rehabilitation program). Four Ways to Present the Benefit The absolute risk reduction of bypass surgery is 4.1 percent (404 –350 = 54; 54/1,325 = 4.1%). The relative risk reduction of bypass surgery is 13.4 percent (4.1/ 30.5 = 13.4%). The percentages of event-free (surviving) patients are 73.6 percent and 69.5 percent, respectively, for surgery and medical therapy. The number of patients needed to be treated to save one life is 25. Whereas the relative risk reduction with bypass surgery is 13.4 percent, the absolute risk reduction is 4.1 percent. The number of patients who need to be treated with bypass surgery to save one more life than by medical treatment is 25 (note that 1 out of 25 corresponds to 4.1 percent). In other words, out of each 25 patients who receive a bypass, 1 patient's death (within 10 years) will be prevented; the other 24 will have no benefit in terms of mortality reduction from the operation. Finally, the number of event-free patients (here the number of patients who survive) is 73.6 percent for bypass surgery versus 69.5 percent for medical treatment. All these are equivalent descriptions of one and the same outcome of an actual randomized trial in which the two treatments were compared.

36. In the United States, an estimated 44,000 to 98,000 people die in hospitals each year because of documented and preventable medical errors.1 In Germany, between 8,000 and 16,000 patients in hospitals die every year because they are administered the wrong medication or the right medication in the wrong amount, and several hundred thousand others develop serious illnesses as a result of such errors.2 An unknown number of people who are not infected with HIV commit suicide because they test positive in screening, not realizing that false positives occur. Each year, some 100,000 German women without breast cancer have part of their breasts surgically removed in the follow-up after a positive test, and only a few of them know that most positive screening mammograms are false positives. As mentioned in a previous chapter, after learning of his own prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York is reported to have urged “everyone to get the PSA test.”3 Thousands of men have followed this advice, many of them not knowing there is no evidence that early detection of prostate cancer reduces mortality. These men can expect no benefit from treatment—only the risk of its side effects, which include incontinence and impotence.4 In the courts, jurors and attorneys struggle with random match probabilities, which lead to confusion and even convictions that later had to be revised.

37. John Q. Public's ignorance of risks is not entirely his fault; it originates not only inside but also outside his mind. Internal sources of ignorance include a preference for distraction over information or for passivity over responsibility. But ignorance of risks is also fueled by external factors ranging from peer pressure to lobbying by trade associations. Step Two in the program of teaching thinking entails overcoming both internal and external sources of ignorance. The goal is (1) to teach people how to use tools for estimating risks, including the uncertainty around these estimates, and (2) to make people aware of the forces aimed at preventing them from estimating risks.

38. Preparedness. Fear of natural, recurrent threats that have endangered us throughout our evolution is easy to learn, whereas fear of evolutionarily novel threats is often hard to learn. This ability to learn to fear an object from only one or very few observations is called preparedness. Rhesus monkeys reared in the laboratory, for instance, show no fear of venomous snakes. However, when a youngster watches an adult exhibiting fear of a snake, the youngster typically acquires this fear just by observing it once. The logic behind this genetic preparedness to learn some things faster than others is obvious. If the youngster had to learn from experience that a snake is poisonous, its chance of survival would be slim. Hence, evolutionary learning accelerates individual learning. But preparedness holds only for certain stimuli. For instance, when the youngster sees another monkey exhibiting a fear reaction towards a flower, it does not acquire a fear of flowers.18 Humans show similar preparedness for learning. It is easy to get a child to fear spiders, snakes, and tigers. All that is needed is that a parent express fear in the presence of a spider and that the child observe the parent's fear. It is hard to get a child to fear electrical outlets. Yet, in modern, industrialized societies, children are much more likely to be harmed by electrical outlets than by spiders. Fears and phobias tend to settle on stimuli that have been dangerous in the past. Darkness, to provide another example, is something that we do not need to teach our children to fear. But humans have changed their world dramatically in the evolutionarily recent past. This is one reason why the things that we fear most are not necessarily the ones most likely to hurt us.

39. Disasters. People tend to fear situations that can take many lives at once. Situations that cause the same number of deaths spread over time tend to be less feared.19 For instance, the causes of death that people tend to fear most, such as plane crashes and nuclear accidents, often have catastrophic potential. Car accidents and cigarette smoking, in contrast, cause a continuous stream of deaths, and despite their having killed many, many times more people than plane crashes or nuclear power accidents, they do not evoke similar levels of fear. Like preparedness for learning, the fear of disasters has an evolutionary rationale. When a group drops below a certain size, the group may be extinguished. When a loss of the same size is distributed over time, however, the community or species may be in a better position to compensate and survive.

40. Unknown hazards. People tend to fear dangers that are new and unknown. Examples include genetic engineering and nuclear technology, as opposed to drinking alcohol. When the new and potentially dangerous technology is additionally perceived to be in the control of unfamiliar people such as the rulers of a foreign country, fear tends to skyrocket.

41. Information needs representation. The idea that it is possible to communicate information in a “pure” form is fiction. Successful risk communication requires intuitively clear representations. Playing with representations can help us not only to understand numbers (describe phenomena) but also to draw conclusions from numbers (make inferences). There is no single best representation, because what is needed always depends on the minds that are doing the communicating. If you want to inform someone about false positives in screening, what constitutes a “good” representation depends on whether the person is a statistician, a physician, or the patient being examined.

42. Dare to Know Aristotle once divided our world into two realms, the heavenly world of immutable regularities and certain knowledge and the messy world of change and uncertainty. In Western culture, people wanted to live in the world of certain knowledge, not in a world that is hard to understand and predict and where accidents and errors reign. For centuries, mathematicians believed they lived in the world of absolute certainty, as did theologians and their followers. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation, however, greatly eroded the empire of certainty. During the Inquisition, for instance, torture was seen as a means of discovering definitive truth, and this noble goal was viewed as justifying its ignoble means. It may not be an accident that the mathematical theory of probability emerged only after this religious turmoil—or that as the new, more modest standard of evidence that grew out of probability theory spread, the use of torture began to decline. By the mid–seventeenth century, a new standard of reason had emerged, one that did not aspire to certainty but to reasonable judgments under uncertainty.27 In our modern technological societies, Aristotle's two realms still coexist. Most of us prefer to wander back and forth between them without much reflection. In sports, for instance, we revel in the world of uncertainty. We know that the outcomes of a game are a mixture of strategy and accident. In sports, as well as in the stock market and other competitive situations, we enjoy uncertainty; otherwise all the excitement, anticipation, and surprise would be lost. In other aspects of our lives, however, we cherish the illusion of certainty and turn our backs on the uncertainty we love so much in the realm of competition and entertainment. For instance, when it comes to food and health, many people take an authority's or a journalist's opinion as definitive without checking to see if it is reasonable.

43. Absolute risk reduction. A measure of the efficacy of a treatment in terms of the absolute number of people saved. For instance, if a treatment reduces the number of people who die of a disease from 6 to 4 in 1,000, then the absolute risk reduction is 2 in 1,000, or 0.2 percent.

44. Base rate. The base rate of an attribute (or event) in a population is the proportion of individuals manifesting that attribute (at a certain point in time). A synonym for base rate is prevalence.

45. Conditional probability. The probability that an event A occurs given event B, usually written as p(A| B). An example of a conditional probability is the probability of a positive screening mammogram given breast cancer, which is around .90. The probability p(A), for instance, is not a conditional probability. Conditional probabilities are notoriously misunderstood, and that in two different ways. One is to confuse the probability of A given B with the probability of A and B; the other is to confuse the probability of A given B with the probability of B given A. One can reduce this confusion by replacing conditional probabilities with natural frequencies.

46. Incidence rate. Unlike prevalence (base rate), which refers to the proportion of individuals in a population manifesting an attribute (or event) at a certain point in time, the incidence rate is the proportion of individuals in a given population developing this attribute within a specified time interval. For instance, the proportion of men with prostate cancer at age 50 is a prevalence; the proportion of men who will develop prostate cancer between 50 and 60 is an incidence rate.

47. Number needed to treat (NNT). A measure of the efficacy of a treatment. For instance, if mammogram screening eventually saves the life of 1 in 1,000 participating women, the NNT (to save one life) is 1,000. In other words, 999 women do not benefit in terms of mortality reduction. NNT is also used to measure the harm of a treatment, such as when about 1 in 7,000 women who take oral contraceptives get thromboembolism, the NNT (with oral contraceptives to cause one case of thromboembolism) is 7,000. In other words, 6,999 do not show this side effect.

## Unthinking: The Surprising Forces Behind What We Buy
**Author:** Harry Beckwith

### Highlights (11)

1. When we learn that Häagen-Dazs isn’t from Scandinavia but from the Bronx, for example, and that the founder made up the name because it sounded Scandinavian to him, that story devolves into mere fantasy and we lose interest—and perhaps some faith.

2. we loathe being told what to do, and we are quick to justify our actions with a favorite American expression: “Hey, it’s a free country.” This makes a particular form of behavior, which you can find in all cultures, particularly common in ours. Psychologists call it reactance, one of our cognitive biases that leads us to make bad decisions. It’s our tendency to resist not just orders but also suggestions, because we dislike giving up our freedom. Reactance explains why Valentine’s retailers get disappointing results when they post banners like “Don’t forget her flowers for Valentine’s Day.” Millions of men who see that message react by going to buy candy instead—unless the local candy retailer has a similar banner, “Don’t forget her candy this Valentine’s Day.” In that case, they just take her out for an expensive dinner.

4. In 2008, Philips Electronics conducted a study intended to measure the cost to American businesses of returned products. Their conclusion startled many people: The cost was $100 billion a year. In years past, this news would have clearly signaled that America’s quality movement had miles to go, that for all the talk about quality circles and Six Sigma, American business was still failing. But in 2008, people reacted differently to the news, because it appeared the quality movement had shown some effect. Only half of the cost of the products we returned—$50 billion—could be attributed to defects in the products. So what was wrong with the other $50 billion worth of products? Nothing. We just couldn’t figure out how to use them. They were too complicated. Now, we might assume that our fellow consumers tried hard to learn about all those products before they returned them. We assume wrong again. These disgruntled buyers didn’t spend days or even hours reading the manuals and tinkering with the product. They spent just minutes—twenty minutes on average. Then they surrendered.

5. We hurry; others don’t. Procter & Gamble learned this when they introduced their popular time-saving Swiffer dusting products to Italy. Italian women wouldn’t buy them. They think that a person should devote time to cleaning and dusting to get the best results; that cleaning means effort. Italians are hard to sell on dishwashers, too, for a similar reason—washing by hand is viewed as superior—and on washing machines, which they believe are hard on clothes. In the end, we see a cultural difference at work here. Americans trust machines and technology; Italians believe that humans are far superior. (Perhaps if our country had produced Leonardo da Vinci, Dante, and Michelangelo, we might view humans as superior to machines, too.) Seeing this, P&G in 2009 repositioned Swiffer in Italy as products to use for the final touchups after cleaning and dusting. And as we probably guessed, Swiffer sales finally took off.

6. We experience what we expect to experience. We expect Calvin Trillin to sound witty and the Blue Fox’s coffee and Provence’s pasta to taste delicious. And they do—even when they don’t. Our expectation, shaped by our entire view of a brand, doesn’t merely influence our experience. It is the experience. Our expectations, many of them arising from the “brand” we have in our mind, alter our experiences. But just how much? Incredibly. We can reach this conclusion by starting with another famous ad campaign: The Pepsi Challenge. These commercials were based on a sensible proposition. Whenever researchers at Pepsi conducted blind taste tests with unmarked cups of soda, almost two-thirds of the tasters preferred their cola to Coca-Cola’s. Voilà! A great idea for an advertising campaign! Why not just film these taste tests so that people everywhere will see that Pepsi tastes better? So they did. Millions saw the ads. And afterwards, those same millions kept right on drinking their beloved Coca-Cola. Somewhat curiously, the Coca-Cola people in Atlanta knew that the Pepsi people in upstate New York were right. In Coke’s blind tests, people preferred Pepsi’s taste, too, but still chose Coke. Voilà! Another great marketing idea! What would happen, the Coke folks reasonably wondered, if we made Coca-Cola taste even better? What if we made it so that people in blind taste tests would like us even more than Pepsi? We will flatten Pepsi! Thus was born the Seward’s Folly of modern marketing, the new Edsel: New Coke. Reconstituted, more delicious than old Coke, more delicious than old and new Pepsi, New Coke won blind taste test after blind taste test. The people at Coca-Cola were merely repeating the mistake of the Pepsi folks, a mistake that rested on what now looks like a comically glaring error: In real life, there are no blind taste tests. We do not drink just any cola; we know what we are drinking.

7. Just after New Year’s Day 2010, a twenty-nine-year-old British builder working at a building site west of London jumped from a landing and landed on a six-inch nail with such force that the nail penetrated his boot and nearly came out the top. Seeing his extreme pain, his coworkers called emergency services, and a car soon rushed the young man to an emergency room. Because moving the nail even slightly caused the man enormous pain, the ER doctors quickly sedated him with midazolam, which is used before surgery to induce drowsiness or unconsciousness. It illustrates the severity of the young man’s pain that the doctors also administered fentanyl, a painkiller often prescribed for terminal cancer patients that is one hundred times more powerful than morphine. (Fentanyl had earned some notoriety just months earlier when investigators found bottles of it in Michael Jackson’s home after the singer’s death.) With the patient sedated and his pain controlled, the doctors then proceeded to carefully remove his work boot. When they finally were able to remove it, they discovered something startling: The nail had passed cleanly between the builder’s toes. There was no injury at all. What happened there? An example of the nocebo effect, one of the more bizarre examples of how our expectations change our perceptions and feelings. If we think we have a nail in our foot, it can hurt so much we need a near-lethal drug to reduce our agony. Repeatedly we see it: What we expect changes what we feel. We taste a Provence pasta or a Coca-Cola, or sense a nail in our work boot, and we experience what we expect to. We experience not things but our ideas of those things. Our brains fool our bodies, just as our bodies often trick our brains.

8. So better or worst aren’t qualities that exist in the world; they are in our brains—our bewildering, erratic, more-complex-than-the-entire-universe brains. This in turn dictates the first principle of marketing in the twenty-first century. Marketers cannot merely develop great products and services; they must develop, nurture, and manage great expectations.

9. To each of us, reality rarely is what is, or what is really happening, at any given moment. It is what we think it is and often merely what we think it must be. The Wizard of Oz is all powerful not because he is—he’s a little old wild-haired man behind a curtain—but because Dorothy and her friends have heard that he is. Paris is magically romantic not because it is but because of all the stories we have heard for years that tell us, “Paris is magically romantic.” Southerners are friendly, Volvos are safe, Six Sigma is genius and virtually indispensable, Maytag washers are indestructible. Or are they? With all that said—that most trends are not trends and that expectations continue their incredible influence over everything we experience—we

10. The study found the real cause of running injuries: As Mars Blackmon (played by the film director Spike Lee) once said in a memorable Nike ad, “It’s gotta be the shoes!” It’s the shoes! Of course! Minimally designed shoes with inadequate cushioning and little or no motion control result in more injuries than properly designed shoes! No. But there is a direct, absolute, and proven correlation between running shoes and running injuries. It’s this: The more expensive the shoe, the more injuries the wearer suffers.

## Aftermath: The Remnants of War: From Landmines to Chemical Warfare--The Devastating Effects of Modern Combat
**Author:** Donovan Webster

### Highlights (3)

1. At a dozen sites around the United States where nuclear material was manufactured for use in bombs, the ground and surroundings have also been contaminated and, doubtlessly, cancers and radiation have cost American lives. Which leads to the ultimate irony of America’s nuclear weapons program. Since the end of World War II, the only victims of United States’ nuclear bombs have been its own citizens and landscape.

2. In 1995, Werner published the first ever baseline environmental report for the Department of Energy, “Estimating the Cold War Mortgage.” His report pointed out, among other things: • In the United States alone, there are at least 10,500 radioactive sites that need to be stabilized and secured for the indeterminate future; • There are no viable, long-term storage areas or plans; • At current levels, if the DOE authorizes no more nuclear materials creation, the maintenance of existing wastes until the year 2070 will cost more than $230 billion.

3. Werner has few answers. “We don’t even know if our culture will be around then,” he says. “We don’t know if our language will be the same; even our iconography. So while we should definitely establish some sort of nuclear priesthood, which passes information down across generations in certain areas, we also need to find an unmistakable symbol. How do you tell people in the future: Don’t dig here.” Since 1979, two major studies have been done to generate such a symbol. “Both said that physical symbology or language can’t work,” Werner says. “But both advised comparisons with natives who controlled ancient lands in different parts of the world. In the American Southwest, the Anasazi inhabited areas with cyanide- or arsenic-contaminated springs. In Australia, natives lived near exposed uranium ores. Both groups used the same symbol to warn others, to say: Don’t go here, because people get sick. They drew snakes on rocks. It’s a simple symbol, one analogous to something else you should watch for. When it comes to a symbol that tells people in the future that we’ve screwed up the landscape and they shouldn’t use it, I favor the snake.”

## Warnings: Finding Cassandras to Stop Catastrophes
**Author:** Richard A. Clarke;R. P. Eddy

### Highlights (17)

1. What the ancient Greeks called Cassandra behavior today’s social scientists sometimes refer to as sentinel intelligence or sentinel behavior, the ability to detect danger from warning signs before others see it. The behavior is observed in a variety of animals, including, we believe, in humans. Those with sentinel intelligence see with great clarity through the fog of indicators, and they warn the pack. In other animals, the pack seems genetically disposed to respond quickly to the warnings of their sentinels. In humans, that ability is less well developed.

2. The late Harvard historian Samuel Huntington proposed that, in analyzing leaders, it is always good to know what world events and personal experiences shaped them while they were young and their world view was being formed. Both the Cassandras and those evaluating their claims should be cognizant of the origins of the prisms they look through to see the world. A

3. During the Manhattan Project, America’s nuclear scientists were putting atomic theory into practice for the first time. Working with their bare hands in the New Mexico desert heat, and wearing nothing more than dungarees and T-shirts, the scientists would cover plutonium spheres, known as pits in the industry, with various materials to discover the optimum ways to reflect the radioactivity from the plutonium back into itself. Reflecting the radiation back into the pit is the first step to creating a nuclear chain reaction and an eventual atomic explosion. The scientists would place reflectors, consisting of metal bricks and thin beryllium hemispheres, around the pit with their hands and use flathead screwdrivers to adjust the distance between the reflectors and the plutonium. The emitted neutrons were reflected back into the pits, and the scientists could then measure the crackling of the chain reaction with their Geiger counters, thus developing a better understanding of when the pit would go critical and exactly what was needed for a nuclear explosion. The researchers called this exercise tickling the dragon’s tail, for it was extraordinarily dangerous.6 Within a period of one year, the dragon awoke twice and each time released a massive deadly flash of neutron radiation, a “supercritical” release of energy. In the first instance, a scientist dropped a brick on the pit and was dead three agonizing weeks later. In the second, the scientist’s screwdriver slipped, and a neutron-reflecting shield clapped down onto the pit. He was dead in nine days. This particular pit came to be called the Demon Core.7 In

4. Perhaps most galling about this horrendous disaster is how small and relatively inexpensive the preventative measures to heed Okamura’s warnings could have been. Precise studies are not available, but it likely would have cost TEPCO about $50 million to emplace an effective combination of better backup generators, waterproofing, and/or higher seawalls. Considering that the nuclear disaster alone will cost Japan at least $100 billion (not to mention the future cancers and the 1,600 who are estimated to have died from the stresses of the evacuation), ignoring Okamura and refusing to spend on safety resulted in damage over two thousand times more expensive.

5. The ineptitude of the SEC staff to police the complex financial industry was complicated by their ready acquiescence to “satisficing” solutions. We will discuss the term in more detail in chapter 9, but briefly, “satisficing” happens when a decision maker addresses the issue but doesn’t solve the actual problem. For example, the IG’s report notes the reason that the SEC’s New York office didn’t look into Markopolos’s second complaint in March 2001: because Madoff wasn’t registered as an asset manager, the SEC decided that the claim that Madoff was a fraudulent asset manager was without merit. Satisficing solutions are often simply window dressing, covering up the real issue and allowing the decision maker to tend to other, less problematic issues.

It is a simple series of questions derived from our observation of past Cassandra Events. It involves four components: (1) the warning, the threat, or risk in question, (2) the decision makers or audience who must react, (3) the predictor or possible Cassandra, and (4) the critics who disparage or reject the warning.

7. *  INITIAL OCCURRENCE SYNDROME: In many cases, the event foretold has “never happened before,” at least not in the cultural memory of the audience, who will therefore resist taking the threat seriously. In our estimation, no obstacle to action is bigger than Initial Occurrence Syndrome, yet it is the easiest objection to logically assail. Doubters of relevant warnings often begin with this objection. Implicitly they are saying that nothing new ever happens, despite the manifest evidence to the contrary. History is full of examples of things happening for the first time. In fact, much of what is taught in high school history classes is simply a list of things that happened for the first time: the first flight of an aircraft, the first man on the moon, the first African American President of the United States, etc. Social psychologists use the term “cognitive bias” to describe the filters, blinders, or limits we place between our points of view and reality. As we have seen in earlier chapters, one of the cognitive biases most relevant to our discussion is the “availability bias,” a filter on perception and thinking derived from relying on familiarity or prior experience. Most predicted events that would be an initial occurrence suffer from the audience’s availability bias, or lack of past experiences to which to relate the prediction. No one in Japan remembered the high water tsunami that had taken place 1,200 years before the flooding of Fukushima; no movie or folklore memorialized it.1 Yukinobu Okamura had to hunt for the record of the event. Rather than asking, “Has it ever happened before?” Cassandras ask, “Can it happen? Is there anything that would prevent it?”2 If the warning is about something that has never happened in the historical record or personal experience of most people, it is likelier to be ignored.

10. Hansen thinks we will likely see a meter of sea-level rise much faster than the IPCC predicts. And once we hit a meter, it’s not as though we just stop there and adapt to that given level. It will only accelerate, and it will accelerate quickly. Hansen warns, “Humanity faces near certainty of eventual sea-level rise of at least Eemian proportions, 5–9 meters, if fossil fuel emissions continue on a business-as-usual course.” To simplify the nonlinear aspect of the melting process, Hansen relates it to doubling times. “It will take you several decades to get to one meter, but then to get to two meters takes only a decade. . . . In our paper we say you’ll reach multi-meter time scale in 50 to 150 years. But it doesn’t really matter in the sense that it will be out of your control and it’s going to happen.”

11. Among the device types that are or will soon be netted into the IoT are pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, insulin pumps, IV pumps (including those for prescription painkillers), and heart-lung machines. The advantages seem obvious. These devices could detect your medical problem and perhaps administer treatment, even if you and your doctor are miles apart. The problem is that the health care industry, which is rushing headlong into the IoT, has a bad track record when it comes to cyber security. BitSight, a Boston firm that ranks companies for their level of cybersecurity, compared five industries: health care, finance, retail, utilities, and federal agencies. Health care, represented by 2,500 companies in the survey, placed dead last. Veracode, another Boston cyber company (for which Dick serves as a member of the board) also looked at five industries, but with a different metric. It asked what percentage of known vulnerabilities in software had been fixed. In manufacturing, over 80 percent of the problems had been addressed. In medicine, it was half that number. In fact, more than three quarters of all medical software applications currently in use have a known vulnerability.

12. Two weeks after the Napa commentary was published, Chinese scientists at Sun Yat-sen University reported that they had used CRISPR/Cas9 to artificially alter the DNA of human embryos in an attempt to correct a gene that was responsible for a rare blood disorder. The Chinese study used embryos that were tripronuclear, containing three sets of DNA, and could not develop into a human being in an attempt to sidestep the ethical questions of editing the human germ line. The study was released in an obscure, Chinese-published journal called Protein & Cell after the mainstream publications for such research, Nature and Science, rejected the paper, considering the research unethical.20 The experiment wasn’t a great success. Of the eighty-six embryos they started with, the Chinese researchers found that CRISPR/Cas9 made the correct edits in only four of them. All four were found to have off-target events, suggesting that the treatment would not have worked if they had been trying to edit viable human embryos.

13. On her second trip to Congress, Professor Doudna and some of her colleagues involved with CRISPR held an all-day public meeting in Washington, D.C., attended by members of Congress, staffers, students, and the general public. “The astounding thing there was that it was standing-room only for the entire day,” she recounted. “I had a sense that people were realizing we are on the verge of being able to edit the human genome in a way that will change evolution, that something profound was happening in science.” Their main message remained that CRISPR should not yet be used to modify the human germ line and that, while research on treating human diseases should certainly continue, the public should be aware that there are risks and benefits of such therapy and that many answers to the relevant questions remained unknown. Policy makers were engaged.

14. Despite the failure of the Chinese scientists’ experiment with human embryos, other researchers are already making significant strides in reducing CRISPR’s error rate. Some believe that improvements to the technology will soon render it safe enough for experimentation on humans, if we haven’t reached that point already. Dr. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard and a signatory of the commentary that laid out the Napa conference’s recommendations, estimates that advances could yield an error rate of about 1 in 300 trillion base-pairs (for reference, the entire human genome is 1/100,000 that number), about the same rate that genetic errors occur naturally. Still, darker questions surrounding the future applications of CRISPR remain at the margin, and not just in the minds of conspiracy theorists. In a November 2015 interview with the New Yorker, Professor Doudna said she recently dreamed that a colleague of hers took her to meet someone. “I went into a room and there was Hitler. He had a pig face and I could only see him from behind and he was taking notes and he said, ‘I want to understand the uses and implications of this amazing technology.’ I woke up in a cold sweat. And that dream has haunted me from that day. Because suppose somebody like Hitler had access to this—we can only imagine the kind of horrible uses he could put it to.”22

15. Simple in vitro fertilization currently costs upwards of $10,000, but gene editing would likely cost many times more. Could CRISPR become a tool for the wealthy elites to engineer genetically superior babies? In a world already racked by increasing wealth inequality and an increasingly distinct cultural divide between the rich and poor, will genetic enhancement accelerate and make permanent the already yawning gap between the haves and the have nots?

## Revolutionary Science: Transformation and Turmoil in the Age of the Guillotine
**Author:** Steve Jones

### Highlights (13)

1. The Tower, La Dame de Fer to the French (a name also bestowed on an equally angular and unyielding British politician and on a torture device whose victims were squeezed to death) is itself a technical marvel. It has eighteen thousand wrought-iron girders, and their ability to cope with high winds was essential to the design. Wrought iron was light and strong, and Eiffel had already designed several railway bridges on the principle that storms should be allowed to blow through rather than being fought off with massive girders. His Parisian monument was so elegantly conceived that the weight of the air bounded by its beams is greater than that of the metal used to construct it, which if melted down to fill the one hundred and twenty-five metre square of its base would be no more than six centimetres deep. Even in a severe gale, his tower sways just seven centimetres at its three-hundred-metre summit.

3. Lightning tended to target the highest point in a town or village, which in many places was the church spire. The theological implications were a serious concern, for as Thomas Aquinas had put it: ‘It is a dogma of faith that demons can produce winds, storms, and rain of fire from heaven’, and to see God direct his anger not at the sinners but at those who hoped to save them much discommoded the clergy. To scare off the unwelcome visitors, church bells were rung at the height of a tempest, while more rational pastors were sure that the bells interfered with the flash itself, and inscribed them with the words Fulgura frango: I break up thunderbolts. Such beliefs often led to disaster. Again and again, the devout came under attack, with the death of thousands. In the Italian city of Brescia the authorities had stored gunpowder in the vaults of the Church of San Nazaro. When the servant of Satan cast his fatal bolt, much of the town was destroyed and three thousand people were killed. Not until 1786 did the Parliament of Paris set forth an edict ‘to make the custom of ringing church bells during storms illegal on account of the many deaths it caused to those who pull the ropes’.

4. To make the explosive, it was added drop by drop to a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids. The process was a ticklish one, as the liquid that emerged was unstable and could be set off with a slight jolt. The job had to be done with great care and the mixture kept at a low temperature in an ice bath. Sometimes it was shipped in frozen form, but that too was dangerous, for if it melted it became even more liable to spontaneous detonation. When the stuff does go off, whether by accident or on purpose, the shock wave travels at thirty times the speed of sound and the charge expands by a thousand times as it transforms itself into a gas that may, for an instant, reach a temperature of 5000°C. The fearsome liquid played a large part in the construction of the first railroad across the United States as engineers blasted a track through the Rocky Mountains. On the way there were frequent, and lethal, accidents, which led the authorities to treat the stuff with suspicion and, for a time, to forbid its transport. It had instead to be synthesised on site. One such disaster killed a close relative of the man responsible for its European supplies, whose company sold an unstable mixture of nitroglycerin with gunpowder called ‘Blasting Oil’. In 1864, an accident blew up Emil Oskar Nobel and several of the workers in their Swedish factory. Devastated by that tragedy, Emil’s older brother Alfred set out to find a safer alternative. What was needed was a way to make the product less susceptible to shock, with no loss of power. Nobel found the key in the fossilised skeletons of tiny marine creatures that had been transformed into a porous soil called kieselguhr. The material soaked up the lethal oil and made it far more stable than before. In 1867, he patented the compound under the name ‘dynamite’, and soon made a vast fortune. Factories sprang up in many places. The British Parliament had passed an Act to forbid ‘the manufacture, import, sale and transport of nitroglycerine and any substance containing it within Great Britain’, but Nobel persisted in his efforts, and the remote location of Ardeer on the Clyde coast – which he described as ‘a sand desert where the wind always blows’ – became the home of the largest explosives factory in the world. In time, new versions emerged. Gelignite, used in blasting, was an amalgam of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose (a reactive nitrogen compound), mixed with pulped wood and saltpetre to absorb the active material. It was easy to transport and became a favourite of terrorists. Ballistite was the same stuff blended with camphor, a carbohydrate, to increase its stability. It was useful in gunnery, as it was smokeless and generated a lesser blast that did not destroy gun barrels. Over the years, other propellants such as cordite (a compound of nitroglycerin with nitrocellulose and petroleum jelly) emerged and were used to lethal effect in the many wars of the twentieth century. They include a substance known as RDX (Research Department Explosive), much used in bombs, torpedoes and depth charges. When blended with a soft plastic, it can be moulded into a gel, now sold as Semtex, the raw material of the Bishopsgate detonator and the force behind the 1988 Lockerbie disaster. So urgent was the demand for RDX that the British handed over the secrets of how to make it to the Americans, and a plant was built on the Wabash river. It incorporated the largest nitric acid plant in the world – which in an odd twist of Franco-British history was run by the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company. Ironically enough, Nobel himself was prescribed nitroglycerin to reduce the symptoms of heart disease, which it does, we now know, when the material is broken down into nitric oxide (one nitrogen linked to one oxygen), a molecule that relaxes blood vessels. He refused to take his medicine and died soon afterwards.

His body temperature was measured every ten seconds through that hundred-degree range – the equivalent of a shift from ice to boiling water. In the first and last stages he found it hard to handle the conditions and had to use a large proportion of his reserves to cope. Even so, the temperature of his body core deviated over the experiment by less than one degree.

11. In the last year of the Second World War the Japanese released thousands of booby-trapped balloons which soared upwards before they found the stream and headed towards enemy territory. A barometer estimated their height and caused ballast to be ejected if the crude weapon dropped too low. It took them about four days to make the trip. Most fell into the sea, but three hundred or so made it to the United States. Just one succeeded in its murderous aim, when a pregnant Oregon woman on a Sunday picnic picked it up. The device killed her and five children with her in the only Second World War deaths from enemy action in the mainland United States. For a time, the authorities suspected that the weapons had been launched from submarines, or even from prisoner-of-war camps, but the sand used for ballast was identical to that found on Japanese beaches, and their origin was proved.

She became a figure of great dignity, who supervised the X-ray machines set up to help treat casualties of the First World War. Her death from leukaemia no doubt came from the lack of safety precautions in those days, and her notebooks – and even her cookery books – are still so radioactive that they are kept in lead-lined boxes.

## A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution
**Author:** Jennifer A. Doudna;Samuel H. Sternberg

### Highlights (40)

1. The issue is this: For the roughly one hundred thousand years of modern humans’ existence, the Homo sapiens genome has been shaped by the twin forces of random mutation and natural selection. Now, for the first time ever, we possess the ability to edit not only the DNA of every living human but also the DNA of future generations—in essence, to direct the evolution of our own species. This is unprecedented in the history of life on earth. It is beyond our comprehension. And it forces us to confront an impossible but essential question: What will we, a fractious species whose members can’t agree on much, choose to do with this awesome power?

2. The genome—a term coined in 1920 by the German botanist Hans Winkler and probably intended as a portmanteau of gene and chromosome—refers to the entire set of genetic instructions found inside a cell.

3. the nucleus isn’t the only place in the cell where DNA is found. The human genome also includes a separate mini-chromosome—just sixteen thousand letters of DNA—located in mitochondria, the energy-producing batteries of the cell. Unlike the genetic code found in other chromosomes, mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother. Mutations in any one of the twenty-three nuclear chromosome pairs or in the mitochondrial chromosome can cause genetic disease.

5. Homologous recombination occurs most famously during the formation of egg and sperm cells, when the two sets of chromosomes we inherit from our parents are pared down to just one, to be combined with a second set during sexual reproduction. In this process of elimination, cells select a blend of the paternal and maternal chromosomes; each pair of chromosomes engage in their own version of sex, exchanging large chunks of DNA in a way that increases genetic diversity.
   - Location: 481-484
   - Page: 32

6. Back when I had decided to determine the molecular structure of the ribozyme, many biologists thought that this type of molecule might offer an alternative method for treating diseases. The ribozyme-based method, as it was envisioned at the time, would differ from both gene therapy (which aimed to fix genetic mishaps by adding healthy genes) and gene editing (which aimed to repair the defective genes themselves) in that it would allow clinicians to cure patients by fixing defective RNA molecules—those messengers that our cells use to convert DNA into protein.
   - Location: 694-698
   - Page: 46

7. A critical feature of this system is that the ribosome must remain in the correct three-letter reading frame; even the slightest hiccup can dramatically and calamitously affect the entire translation. To better appreciate this, imagine the consequences of skipping the first letter in the sentence The dog bit the mailman in the leg but retaining the same number of letters per word. You’d be left with the nonsensical sentence Hed ogb itt hem ailmani nt hel eg. If a ribosome did this while reading genetic code, the garbled message would result in a scrambled protein containing an entirely incorrect amino acid sequence. On top of that, if the garbled message contained one of the three stop codons, the translation process would terminate prematurely. Gene expression would be disrupted. Herein lies the most basic power of CRISPR—it can destroy a gene’s ability to produce a functional protein. If a CRISPR-edited gene ends up with a small insertion or deletion, the corresponding mRNA produced from that gene will be similarly perturbed. And the majority of the time, those extra or missing letters will disrupt the strict three-letter grouping of genetic code, so the protein will be wildly mutated or, more commonly, not produced at all. In any case, the protein can’t play its normal role. Geneticists refer to this as a gene knockout, or KO, just like in boxing, since the gene’s function has effectively been shut off.

8. Fortunately, cells possess the machinery to perform a second type of repair, one that is far more precise and controlled than merely gluing broken DNA back together. Instead of joining DNA segments unrelated in sequence, this alternative mode—a pathway that early gene-editing researchers used to their advantage—exclusively rejoins segments that are similar in sequence. This pickiness explains the two synonymous terms that refer to this process: homologous recombination and homology-directed repair. Homologous recombination is similar to how a photographer assembles a landscape panorama from three overlapping photos. To get the alignment just right, she has to correctly overlap the outer regions of the middle photo and the inner regions of the outer photos. If the middle part of the panorama is cut or damaged, she can take a duplicate of that middle photo and use the same match-up principle to reconstruct the panorama. And if the real-life landscape changes—say, if a new tower is erected or a large tree falls—she can seamlessly update the panorama by slotting in a new picture using the same approach.

   - Page: 109

9. when a cell is faced with a broken chromosome as well as a second piece of DNA that matches the two broken ends—a repair template, much like the photographer’s duplicate photo—it chooses the better repair option: it pastes the DNA fragment into the broken chromosome while maintaining a perfect overlap between the matching ends. This strategy means that a harmful genetic mutation at or near the site targeted by CRISPR can be permanently replaced with a healthy new DNA sequence. As long as researchers combine CRISPR with a repair template that matches the area of the broken gene, the cell will gladly grab the replacement part and use it to patch up the damage.
   - Location: 1671-1676
   - Page: 109

10. By arming Cas9 with two different RNA guides, researchers can program CRISPR to slice apart a chromosome in two adjacent genes; the cell survives the attack by reassembling the chromosome in one of three ways. With twice as many broken DNA ends for the cell to deal with, option one is for it to kick end-joining repair into high gear and mend both damaged sites concurrently by gluing everything back together. Often, however, the window of opportunity for this repair mode is narrow, due to the constant helter-skelter motion of molecules in the cell. If the segment of DNA between the two cut sites diffuses away, a cell will settle for option two, in which the intervening segment is simply left out and the outermost broken ends are glued back together. This repair mode is comparable to how old-school film editors removed scenes from a movie reel: they simply cut the film in two places—at the beginning and the end of the scene—tossed the scrapped frames, and pasted the new ends together. The third repair option involves the inversion of the intervening DNA segment. In this case, the cut-out section of DNA is jostled around in such a way that it stays roughly in place but gets flipped around, so its front end is where its back end used to be and vice versa. The same enzymes that facilitate end-joining repair will blindly reattach the missing piece, regardless of its orientation.

11. Proteins are typically composed of hundreds to thousands of amino acid building blocks, a large majority of which are there to define the protein’s overall three-dimensional shape; only a few amino acids contribute the critical chemical groups that enable the enzyme to catalyze specific reactions.
   - Location: 1696-1698
   - Page: 111

12. The deactivated CRISPR system functions like a molecular packhorse. Instead of targeting specific genes with the end goal of cutting the DNA, scientists combine Cas9 or the guide RNA with protein payloads and then program CRISPR to ferry those payloads to specific genes in the cell. The protein cargo comprises molecules that influence how genes are expressed, either “brightening” or “dimming” their functional output. Gene-expression control—the complex and overlapping inputs that govern when and for how long genetic information in the form of DNA is turned into protein—is arguably as important to biology as the underlying genetic information itself. Nearly all fifty trillion or so cells in the human body contain the same genome, and yet these highly diverse cell types are of unique shapes and sizes and are arranged into complex organs that have different properties and functions. Some cells attack pathogens in the blood, others expand and contract to pump blood through the body, and still others store memories in the central nervous system; the only thing differentiating immune cells, heart cells, and brain cells is the precise pattern of gene expression that created them. Moreover, the genetic mutations that cause cancer and disease often have their dire effects not because they completely inactivate genes but because they cause genes to express themselves in the wrong way. The ability to activate or interfere with gene expression is nearly as powerful as the ability to edit the genes themselves.
   - Location: 1708-1719

13. Armed with the complete CRISPR toolkit, scientists can now exert nearly complete control over both the composition of the genome and its output. Whether that’s done through sloppy end joining or precise homologous recombination, by one cut or multiple cuts or even no cuts at all, the range of possibilities is immense. And the pace of further tool development isn’t slowing down. Genetic engineers have built fluorescent versions of CRISPR so that the three-dimensional organization of genes can be visualized inside cells; versions that target mRNA instead of DNA, enabling a unique kind of genetic control; versions that introduce barcodes into the genome, allowing researchers to record a cell’s history directly in the language of DNA; and on and on.

14. The only thing necessary to get started is a copy of the basic CRISPR-containing artificial chromosome, or plasmid. This need has been conveniently met on a massive scale by the nonprofit organization Addgene, a highly successful and ever-expanding plasmid repository and plasmid-distribution service. Addgene is like Netflix, only for plasmids. Once Martin and I had submitted our CRISPR article, we sent his plasmids to Addgene for safekeeping, much as film studios license their movies to Netflix. Many other research laboratories that produce CRISPR plasmids do the same. Addgene keeps careful track of the plasmids it has on file, advertises the plasmids and their exact specifications on a website, and generates thousands of duplicate copies that can be distributed to eager customers. The cost to academic laboratories: in 2016, just sixty-five dollars per plasmid.

15. The second example involves potatoes, the world’s third most important food crop after wheat and rice. The lengthy cold storage required to increase potatoes’ shelf life can lead to cold-induced sweetening, a phenomenon in which starches are converted into sugars such as glucose and fructose. Any cooking process involving high heat—necessary to make french fries and potato chips—converts these sugars into acrylamide, a chemical that is a neurotoxin and a potential carcinogen. Cold-induced sweetening also causes potato chips to brown and take on a bitter taste, which results in a huge amount of waste; processing plants discard 15 percent of their potatoes a year for this reason. Using gene editing, researchers at Calyxt easily addressed the problem in Ranger Russet potatoes: they inactivated the single gene that produced glucose and fructose. The result: a 70 percent drop in acrylamide levels in potato chips made with the enhanced spuds, and no chip browning.

16. The disjunction between scientific consensus and public opinion on the topic of GMOs is disturbing, to say the least. I see it as partly a reflection of the breakdown in communication between scientists and the public at large. Already in my relatively short time working on CRISPR, I’ve discovered how challenging it can be to maintain a constructive, open dialogue between these two worlds—but also how necessary that kind of communication is for the advancement of scientific discoveries.

17. Some bioethicists, like Jeantine Lunshof at Harvard Medical School, are concerned about genetic manipulation being used “for the sole purpose of satisfying idiosyncratic aesthetic preferences of humans.” Yet I’m not convinced this is categorically a bad thing. After all, at any ordinary dog park, you could find a four-pound Chihuahua frolicking next to a two-hundred-pound Great Dane—both members of the same species. What is breeding but another tool of genetic manipulation, like CRISPR, only less predictable and efficient? There’s even a case to be made that this kind of genetic manipulation is better than breeding. Unlike micropigs, whose health is no different than their normal-size relatives, extensive inbreeding of dogs has had devastating health consequences. Labradors are prone to some thirty genetic conditions, 60 percent of golden retrievers succumb to cancer, beagles are commonly afflicted with epilepsy, and Cavalier King Charles spaniels suffer from seizures and persistent pain due to their deformed skulls. These poignant medical problems haven’t kept humans from letting tastes dictate the genotype and phenotype of humankind’s best friend.

18. Germ cells are any cells whose genome can be inherited by subsequent generations, and thus they make up the germline of the organism—the stream of genetic material that is passed from one generation to the next. While eggs and sperm are the most obvious germ cells in humans, the germline also encompasses the progenitors of these mature sex cells as well as stem cells from the very early stages of the developing human embryo.

20. Normally, by the time a mouse with a disease-causing genetic mutation reaches adulthood, it’s too late to correct the error; what began as a mistake in a single fertilized egg cell has been copied into billions of descendant cells, making it all but impossible to stamp out every last trace of the disease. (Imagine trying to correct an error in a news article after the newspapers have been printed and delivered, as opposed to when the article is still just a text file on the editor’s computer.)

21. That’s not to say it’ll be easy to get CRISPR to these locations, much less get it inside the cells themselves. This delivery problem is one of the greatest challenges that somatic gene-editing technologies will have to face. The available delivery strategies can be broken down into two major categories: in vivo gene editing (from the Latin for “within the living,” as mentioned earlier) and ex vivo gene editing (from the Latin for “out of the living”). In the former approach, CRISPR is sent directly into the body of the patient to do its work onsite; in the latter, the patient’s cells are edited outside of the body and then placed back into the patient. Ex vivo therapy is the far simpler approach, and since scientists have already mastered editing cells in the lab, we’re one step closer to this mode of therapy than to the in vivo kind. Another benefit of ex vivo gene editing is that the gene-edited cells can be subjected to rigorous quality-control testing before ever seeing a patient’s body.

22. In people of African and Asian descent, the thirty-two-letter CCR5 deletion is virtually nonexistent, but it’s fairly prevalent among Caucasian people; 10 to 20 percent of Caucasians possess one copy of the mutated gene, and homozygous individuals—those who possess two copies—are completely resistant to HIV. Roughly 1 to 2 percent of Caucasians worldwide (most of them in northeastern Europe) are fortunate enough to have this trait.

26. CRISPR—at least, the original version of it found in bacteria—is not an entirely error-free method of targeting and cutting DNA.
   - Location: 2644-2645
   - Page: 173

27. If CRISPR is programmed to target a twenty-letter sequence in gene X, but gene Y has a similar DNA sequence that differs in only one letter, there is a finite probability that CRISPR will introduce edits in both genes. The less closely the two sequences mirror each other, the lower the likelihood of off-target mutations. Researchers have already begun to find ways around this potential problem. Multiple laboratories have written computer algorithms that will automatically probe the three-billion-letter human genome to see how many other regions have sequences similar to the one a scientist wants to edit. If the number of potential off-target DNA sequences is too high, the researcher, aided by the algorithm, can simply select a new region to target. (In many cases, scientists can edit the same gene by choosing from a number of closely spaced DNA sequences.) The problem with this approach, though, is that the computer algorithm, no matter how well designed, may not always successfully predict off-target edits.

   - Page: 176

29. the dosage of CRISPR affects the likelihood of the genome being riddled with unintended mutations. In general, the more Cas9 and guide RNA a cell gets and the longer those molecules hang around, the more likely it is that CRISPR will find slightly related but mismatched sequences and introduce off-target edits. The trick is to deliver just enough CRISPR into cells so that the right DNA target sequence gets edited, but no more than that.

30. Previous genetic-engineering technologies, including gene therapies and RNA interference, were similarly extolled as pivotal advances that would completely transform medicine, yet hundreds of clinical trials have thrown quite a bit of cold water on that enthusiasm. That’s not to say that we’re heading for the same sort of rude awakening with gene editing, just that it’s important to temper the excitement with realistic expectations, methodical research, and meticulous clinical trials.
   - Location: 2705-2708
   - Page: 177

31. I am extremely excited and enthusiastic about virtually all the phenomenal progress being made with CRISPR—save for the advancements on one front. I think we should refrain from using CRISPR technology to permanently alter the genomes of future generations of human beings, at least until we’ve given much more thought to the issues that editing germ cells will raise. Until we have a better understanding of all the attendant safety and ethical issues, and until we have given a broader range of stakeholders the opportunity to join the discussion, scientists would do well to leave the germline alone. But, really, whether we’ll ever have the intellectual and moral capacity to guide our own genetic destiny is an open question—one that has been on my mind since I began to realize what CRISPR was capable of. For this reason and others, I’ve come to see a clear boundary between the procedures described in this chapter and those involved in germline editing. We should think twice before crossing that line. And then we should think again.

34. Of course, prenatal genetic testing exists for embryos that arise from sexual reproduction as well, and it is increasingly practiced today. Amniocentesis or a simple blood sample taken from the mother (which harbors trace amounts of the fetus’s DNA) can reveal chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome and even specific disease-causing gene mutations.

35. Science and technology often claim to be servants of society; they should take that promise seriously. Imagining what is right and appropriate for our world—and what threatens its moral foundations—is a task for democracy, not for science.” I absolutely agree that society as a whole—rather than scientists individually or even as a group—should decide how any given technology is used. But there’s a wrinkle here, which is that society cannot make decisions about technologies it doesn’t understand, and certainly not about those it knows nothing about.

37. Our DNA is constantly changing, roiled by random, naturally occurring mutations. These natural mutations are the very drivers of evolution, but they are also how inheritable genetic diseases can arise. Every time our cells duplicate their DNA during cell division, somewhere between two and ten novel DNA mutations creep into the genome. Every person experiences roughly one million mutations throughout the body per second, and in a rapidly proliferating organ like the intestinal epithelium, nearly every single letter of the genome will have been mutated at least once in at least one cell by the time an individual turns sixty.

38. Even the sex cells that create the embryo—the mother’s egg and the father’s sperm—have incorporated new mutations that never before existed in either family’s germline. As a result, each one of us begins life with fifty to a hundred random mutations that arose de novo (“anew”) in our parents’ germ cells.

39. editing an embryo’s CCR5 gene might make the resulting human resistant to HIV but more susceptible to the West Nile virus. Correcting the two mutated copies of the beta-globin gene in people who suffer from sickle cell disease would rid them of the illness but also deprive them of the mutation’s protection against malaria. These are far from the only gene edits that have both positive and negative effects. Researchers now suspect that people who carry one copy of the mutated gene that causes cystic fibrosis (which requires two copies) have an increased defense against tuberculosis, an infectious disease that accounted for 20 percent of all European deaths between 1600 and 1900. Even gene variants implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s may have benefits, such as improved cognitive function and better episodic and working memory in young adults.

## The Age of Genomes: Tales From the Front Lines of Genetic Medicine
**Author:** Steven Monroe Lipkin;Jon Luoma

### Highlights (23)

1. Into the first hamper of gene mutations go the relatively few select ones often referred to as “actionable.” Like stained clothes in your dirty laundry that need to be sorted out to go to the dry cleaners, the hamper of actionable gene mutations has the most precious and sought after contents. Actionable genes are the ones medicine can create a plan to fix, gene mutations with both a categorical imperative to inform patients what to do and a package insert telling doctors how to do it.
   - Location: 67-70
   - Page: 5

2. Occasionally, actionable gene mutations seem to emerge out of nowhere. These are often referred to as incidentalomas or (more recently) secondary findings—
   - Location: 83-84
   - Page: 6

3. A second hamper holds the wish-they-were-actionable gene mutations, the unactionables. These terrible mutations portent a grim future, but medicine has, sadly, little to offer—knowledge without power, impotence. Many people just do not want to know what tragedy awaits them until it unfolds. An example is familial Alzheimer disease, for which we have little to offer patients who are still cogent and able to anticipate the future. Here, knowing what may be can cause great anxiety that is not productive—even, at worst, inspiring despair. Furthermore, most mutations in this group are for diseases for which people are at increased risk but not certain to develop,

4. A third hamper contains the potentially actionable genes. Say you have a genetic variant that causes increased sensitivity to clopidogrel, a drug that you’ve never heard of, but will ten years hence.

5. A fourth hamper has laundry thrown in that is really someone else’s and not yours. These are genes that don’t directly affect your health, but that may be more significant for your siblings, kids, and cousins.
   - Location: 107-108

6. A fifth hamper holds genes that offer personal insights but aren’t really interesting to anyone except you and your family, the laundry regulars. These are not necessarily mutations, but mostly more subtle changes called variants that can affect, often modestly, your weight, height, the age you began puberty, and the fabric of your daily life. Maybe they explain why you could never make that high C in chorus and sat in the back row,
   - Location: 118-121
   - Page: 8

7. A sixth hamper holds the mutations that are not yours and you want to avoid at all costs. They are like the bright red shirt that runs and ruins the rest of your laundry. These are the gene mutations that appear in tumors. Today we know that cancer is really a disease of DNA, and whole genome sequencing can find the very root of the cancer, with the hope of digging it out, at least sometimes. Searching for mutations in developing cancers is now one of the most common reasons why people have their genome sequenced. These individuals are looking for actionable (treatable by drugs already on the market) or potentially actionable (treatable with drugs in clinical trials but not yet fully vetted) mutations in the tumor that are not in normal cells.

8. However, there’s an old clinical pearl (the sort of useful tip you give to medical students) in medical genetics: if you are called to see a child with six fingers, the last thing you look at are the hands. That way you don’t become so distracted by the obvious problem that you forget about everything else that might be going on. In this way, medical genetics is an opposite of emergency room medicine, where you are usually forced urgently to focus on the acute problem at hand and deal with other issues later.
   - Location: 445-449

9. An embryo at risk for inheriting genetic disease can be evaluated by a process known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Through “assisted hatching,” a technician can prick the outer surface of an in vitro fertilized embryo with a laser, chemicals, or even a finely drawn glass needle. Two to three dozen cells can then be gently taken from the cells destined to become the placenta through a hatched opening on its outer surface, and the genetic material sequenced to look for a specific mutation. Embryos that undergo this process largely survive no worse for wear, but do carry a higher likelihood of becoming identical twins. Embryos found by the genetic tests to carry harmful mutations are not implanted.

10. Similar to an expert art critic, each individual pathologist’s point of view and ability to pick up patterns of diagnosis have been molded by mentors. The mentors, in turn, were taught by their own mentors. Thus, each hospital can have its own institutional culture of surgical pathology diagnosis, with little use of universal criteria or diagnostic “gold standards” from one hospital to the next. Subjectivity as well as objectivity is weightily represented on the scales. For many diagnoses, particularly for rarer diseases for which there is less of a collective experience base, there is more agreement between pathologists from the same hospital in coming to a diagnosis than there would be from pathologists from different institutions. In addition to the effects of mentor-driven institutional cultures, there can be a sort of group bias driven by a “big dog” effect, in which a group of people in a room looking at something and trying to agree on a conclusion defer either to the most “experienced,” alpha-dog, senior physicians, or to the loudest, most articulate, most opinionated physicians.1
   - Location: 1338-1346
   - Page: 88

11. Today, the common practice of naming cancers by the organ or origin (lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and so on) remains the norm. However, the fairly recent recognition that cancer is primarily a disease of DNA has begun to change the classification of cancers, organizing them more specifically according to the mutations carried by the tumor cells.
   - Location: 1372-1375
   - Page: 90

12. Limiting the number of genes we test for can have an entirely different sort of advantage: we might be able to avoid the incidentaloma syndrome. The incidentaloma syndrome refers to the problems that arise from finding something we weren’t initially looking for and that all too often becomes nothing more than a distraction. Sometimes such a distraction can have serious unintended consequences.

13. There are about 180,000 exons in the 22,000 or so genes, and most of the mutations that we can identify and understand are located in the exons. The exome is the 2 percent of the human genome that makes proteins thought to be the most important products of the genome. Sequencing the exome in general is considered an effective technology to detect the DNA sequence changes that we can clearly interpret as being mutations causing genetic maladies.

14. On the interpretative side, my experience as a genetic professional instructed me to focus not on the greys, but on the blacks and whites: the genetic variants that are clearly benign and those that have strong effects on proteins that when mutated have powerful effects on disease predisposition. The blacks and whites are sometimes referred to as the Interpretome. These genes are known to greatly increase the risk of disease and the variants that are highly likely to be mutations.

16. There is often not much transparency in providing quality-control statistics to genetic professionals who order these tests and their patients. For example, how deep and complete is the sequencing coverage, as less coverage is more prone to miscalling mutations? What specific algorithm is used to distinguish classification of a genetic variant as benign versus deleterious? In some cases, cross-contamination from other patients’ DNA run on the same machines can cause problems as well, and I have seen this arise from at least one genetic-testing company that should have done better.
   - Location: 2110-2114
   - Page: 138

17. This highlights an important point: If you have your genome sequenced, you want to choose a testing laboratory that will continue to update the interpretations of variants as new medical genomic knowledge accumulates over time and then alert you with the information.

   - Page: 146

18. GINA prohibits genetic discrimination in health coverage and employment. Health insurers and employers are not allowed to request genetic information to be used in any of their decisions, and parents don’t have to purchase health insurance before their children are conceived in order to avoid later rejection because of a “pre-existing disease” clause. The Genetic Alliance called this landmark in the history of genetics in the United States “the first civil rights bill of the new century.”25 But, GINA does not protect against discrimination involving life, disability, and long-term-care insurance, and it does not apply to companies that employ fewer than fifteen employees. However, in some states there are additional laws that provide further protections beyond GINA. The Council for Responsible Genetics is a good source of information about the specific protections provided in each state.26 For example, Cal-GINA in the state of California provides certain protections against discrimination in life, long-term-care, and disability insurance as well as in health insurance and employment. A study of cancer genetic health professionals found that before GINA, 26 percent stated they would perform genetic testing using an alias because of concerns over potential discrimination, whereas after GINA’s passage, only 3.2 percent said they would consider using an alias.

19. In theory, a newborn could have up to six distinct parents. The first is a genetic father who provides the genetic material (in the form of sperm) to create the child. The second could be a social father who helps nurture and raise a child even though they might be biologically unrelated. Next are up to four mothers. The first provides the genetic egg (or ovum). The second provides the mitochondria DNA for the ova. The third is the gestational mother who carries the child, and the fourth is the social mother who helps raise the child. Social parents, of course, could also be of the same gender or trans-gender. Divorce and remarriage could further increase the social parent tally as the child grows up.

20. We see the world not necessarily as it is, but as we are—that’s a mantra of our colleagues the cognitive brain scientists. The human brain is hard-wired to see patterns in randomly collected data, even when there are none, a genetic predilection of intelligent animals whose technical term is apophenia. Examples include phallic objects in Rorschach tests, ghosts in nighttime shadows, and unidentified bright objects on smudgy MRI scans.

22. The influence of parents’ diet on their unborn children is sometimes known as Barker’s theory, named for British scientist David J. P. Barker, who first proposed it in 1990. Barker’s theory states that paternal diet, such as high fat or low protein, or maternal caloric restriction, prepare the fetus after birth for famine-like conditions, also called a thrifty phenotype, with a metabolism adjusted for optimal weight gain and retention.

23. A final reminder for patients: genetic medicine’s goals are to make more precise evaluations of disease risk, a concept embedded in probability, not certainty. Unless you are dealing with one of the extremely rare cases of genetic diseases that are fully penetrant (that is, having a 99 percent chance of manifesting if you carry a mutation, such as for Huntington disease), if a doctor or genetic professional tells you he or she knows what is going to happen, find another health-care provider!

## This Idea Must Die: Scientific Theories That Are Blocking Progress
**Author:** Mr. John Brockman

### Highlights (19)

1. The “Something” includes concepts like information, emergence, accidents, historical contingency, adaptation, and selection—all characteristics of complex adaptive systems, whether organisms, societies, ecosystems, or economies. These are composed of myriad individual constituents or agents, which take on collective characteristics generally unpredictable (certainly in detail) from their underlying components, even if the interactive dynamics are known. Unlike the Newtonian paradigm on which the Theory of Everything is based, the complete dynamics and structure of complex adaptive systems cannot be encoded in a small number of equations. Indeed, in most cases, probably not even in an infinite number! Furthermore, predictions to arbitrary degrees of accuracy are not possible, even in principle.

4. There’s no reason to believe, and much reason not to believe, that the measure of a so-called “Intelligence Quotient” in any way reflects some basic cognitive capacity or “natural kind” of the human mind. The domain-general measure of IQ isn’t motivated by any recent discovery of cognitive or developmental psychology. It thoroughly confounds domain-specific abilities—distinct mental capacities for, say, geometrical and spatial reasoning about shapes and positions, mechanical reasoning about mass and motion, taxonomic reasoning about biological kinds, social reasoning about other people’s beliefs and desires, and so on—which are the only sorts of cognitive abilities for which an evolutionary account seems plausible in terms of natural selection for task-specific competencies. Nowhere in the animal or plant kingdoms does there ever appear to have been natural selection for a task-general adaptation. An overall measure of intelligence or mental competence is akin to an overall measure for “the body,” taking no special account of the various and specific bodily organs and functions, such as hearts, lungs, stomach, circulation, respiration, digestion, and so on. A doctor or biologist presented with a single measure for “Body Quotient” (BQ) wouldn’t be able to make much of it. IQ is a general measure of socially acceptable categorization and reasoning skills. IQ tests were designed in behaviorism’s heyday, when there was little interest in cognitive structure.

5. So, what evolutionary advantage does longevity bring, even the post-reproductive longevity typical of humans? The answer surely is that humans can benefit—as no other species could do—from the presence of mentally sound grandparents and great-grandparents, whose role in caretaking and teaching has been key to the success of human culture.

   - Page: 38

6. Unfortunately, the cause-and-effect paradigm doesn’t fail just at the quantum scale. It also falls apart when we try to use causation to explain complex dynamical systems like the biochemical pathways of a living organism, the transactions of an economy, or the operations of the human mind. These systems all have patterns of information flow that defy our tools of storytelling. A gene does not “cause” a trait like height or a disease like cancer. The stock market did not go up “because” the bond market went down. These are just our feeble attempts to force a storytelling framework onto systems that don’t work like stories. For such complex systems, science will need more powerful explanatory tools, and we’ll learn to accept the limits of our old methods of storytelling. We’ll come to recognize that causes and effects don’t exist in nature—that they’re just convenient creations of our minds.

7. we should trust EBM only if the science behind best practices is infallible and comprehensive, and that’s certainly not the case. Medical science is not infallible. Practitioners shouldn’t believe a published study just because it meets the criteria of randomized-controlled-trial design. Too many of these studies cannot be replicated. Sometimes the researcher got lucky and the experiments that failed to replicate the finding never got published or even submitted to a journal (the so-called publication bias). In rare cases, the researcher has faked the results.
   - Location: 2752-2756
   - Page: 180

8. medical science is not comprehensive. Best practices often take the form of simple rules to follow, but practitioners work in complex situations. EBM relies on controlled studies that vary one thing at a time, rarely more than two or three. Many patients suffer from multiple medical problems, such as type-2 diabetes compounded with asthma. The protocol that works with one problem may be inappropriate for the others. EBM formulates best practices for general populations, but practitioners treat individuals and need to take individual differences into account.
   - Location: 2758-2761
   - Page: 180

9. reliance on EBM can impede scientific progress. If hospitals and insurance companies mandate EBM, backed up by the threat of lawsuits when adverse outcomes are accompanied by any departure from best practices, physicians will become reluctant to try alternative treatment strategies that haven’t yet been evaluated using randomized controlled trials. Scientific advancement can be stifled if front-line physicians who blend medical expertise with respect for research are prevented from exploration and discouraged from making discoveries.

10. the one thing Big Data isn’t particular good at is—well, identifying laws. Big Data is brilliant at detecting correlation; the more robust your data set, the better chance you have of identifying correlations, even complex ones involving multiple variables. But correlation never was causation and never will be. All the Big Data in the world won’t, by itself, tell you whether smoking causes lung cancer. To really understand the relationship between smoking and cancer, you need to run experiments and develop mechanistic understandings of things like carcinogens, oncogenes, and DNA replication.

12. Most of us are interested in a theory of the mind because we want to explain, predict, and control behaviors, mental states, and experiences. Given that mental phenomena are physically realized in the brain just as cake properties are physically realized by their ingredients and interactions, understanding the brain is incredibly useful. But if we want to know (for instance) how to influence minds to achieve particular behaviors, it would be a mistake to look for explanations solely at the level of the brain.

13. emotions—states of being—play an important part in the mind’s cognitive work. They allow you, for instance, to feel your way to a cognitive goal. (“He walked to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.” Jane Austen, Persuasion.) Thoughts contain information, but feelings (mild wistfulness, say, on a warm summer morning) contain none. Wistfulness is merely a way to be.

14. Those who note that computers-that-can-feel are incredible are sometimes told, “You assert that many billions of tiny, meaningless computer instructions, each unable to feel, could never create a system that feels. Yet neurons are also tiny, ‘meaningless,’ and feel nothing—but 100 billion of those yields a brain that does feel.” Which is irrelevant; 100 billion neurons yield a brain that supports a mind, but 100 billion sand grains or used tires yields nothing. You need billions of the right article arranged in the right way to get feeling.

15. The only way to solve inductive problems well is to be biased. Because the available evidence isn’t enough to determine the right answer, you need to have predispositions independent of that evidence. And how well you solve the problem—how often your guesses are correct—depends on having biases that reflect how likely different answers are. Human beings are very good at solving inductive problems. Finding objects in images and interpreting natural language are two problems that people still solve better than computers. And the reason is that human minds have biases finely tuned for solving these problems.

16. Throughout history, we have used technological systems as metaphors to describe how the body and brain might work. Ancient Greek water technology led to the four humors and the idea that they must be kept in balance. By the 18th century, clock mechanisms and flows of fluids were used as metaphors for what happened in the brain. By the first half of the 20th century, a common metaphor for the brain was a telephone switching network. Indeed, the mathematics developed for signal propagation in telegraph and telephone wires was used to model action potentials in axons. By the 1960s, cyberneticians were using models of negative feedback—originally developed for the steam engine and greatly expanded during the Second World War for controlling the aiming of guns—to try to develop models for the brain. But these soon ran out of steam, so to speak, and were supplanted by metaphors of the brain as a digital computer. We started to hear claims of the brain as the hardware and the mind as the software—a model that didn’t much help our understanding of either brain or mind. Throughout the later 20th century, the brain became a massively parallel digital supercomputer, and now you can find claims that the brain and the World Wide Web are similar in how they work, with Web pages and neurons playing similar roles and hyperlinks and synapses mapping to each other. This suggests that metaphors for the brain will continue to evolve as technology evolves, with the brain always corresponding to the most complex technology we currently possess. But does the metaphor of the day have an effect on the science of the day? I claim that it does, and that the computational metaphor leads researchers to ask questions today that will one day seem quaint, at best.

17. We should retire the idea that goes by the name “information overload.” It’s no longer useful. The Internet scholar Clay Shirky puts it well: “There’s no such thing as information overload. There’s only filter failure.”t If your filters are bad, there’s too much to attend to and never enough time. These aren’t trends powered by technology, they’re conditions of life.

19. Data alone have no voice. There are no “raw” data, as Kepler’s saga shows. Choosing what data to collect and how to think about them requires insight into the invisible. Making good sense of the data collected requires the classic conservative methods: intuition, modeling, theorizing, and then, finally, statistics.

## Rise of the Necrofauna
**Author:** Britt Wray

### Highlights (2)

1. CLONING Animals have three types of cells: somatic cells, germ cells, and stem cells. The first, somatic cells, are common specialized cells that make up most of the body, like skin, liver, or blood cells. Somatic cells are diploid, meaning that they carry two copies of each chromosome, one from the organism’s mother and one from its father. The second, germ cells, are what give rise to gametes—sperm and eggs—in sexually reproducing organisms. Germ cells are haploid, meaning they have only one copy of each chromosome; when a haploid sperm and a haploid egg combine, they produce a diploid zygote, which later develops into an embryo. Importantly, a zygote contains some cells that are completely undifferentiated, called stem cells. Where differentiation refers to the process whereby cells, tissues, and organs gain special features during development, undifferentiated cells are those that lack special features. Some stem cells can turn into absolutely any cell type of the body as well as placental cells; these are called totipotent stem cells.

2. As the zygote develops into an embryo, those cells lose their ability to become placental cells but are still able to become any type of cell in the body and are called pluripotent stem cells.

## Aha! The Neuroscience of Insight
**Author:** John Kounios;Mark Beeman

### Highlights (78)

1. the same characteristic of the right hemisphere that enables people to flexibly comprehend language—namely, the ability to draw together distantly related information—also contributes to aha moments.
   - Location: 54-55

2. much can be learned by considering how people who tend to experience many insights—we call them “Insightfuls”—think, and how they differ from “Analysts,” who tend to rely more on deliberate, methodical thought.
   - Location: 171-172

3. Insights have two key features. The first one is that they pop into your awareness, seemingly out of nowhere.
   - Location: 176-176
   - Page: 12

4. The other key feature of insights is that they yield, often literally, a different way of looking at things.

5. We define creativity as the ability to reinterpret something by breaking it down into its elements and recombining these elements in a surprising way to achieve some goal.
   - Location: 213-214
   - Page: 14

6. When this kind of creative recombination takes place in an instant, it’s an insight. But recombination can also result from the more gradual, conscious process that cognitive psychologists call “analytic” thought. This involves methodically and deliberately considering many possibilities until you find the solution.
   - Location: 221-223
   - Page: 15

7. Analytic thinking is well suited to familiar situations.
   - Location: 226-226

8. Analytic thought is an effective way to deal with such clear-cut problems, but it’s less helpful for problems that are too complicated for you to calculate all the permutations or for which it’s not entirely clear what you have to work with.

10. According to one CEO, in the face of confusion, “It’s insight that helps to capture opportunity.” It provides a new vantage point for conceiving a solution that is not only within reach, but may also, in hindsight, even seem obvious.

11. In the first step, you grapple with a problem. This is sometimes called “immersion” in all of its aspects: the facts, the tools at your disposal, and your goal. You may consciously try to solve the problem, or you may just study it. If you do try to solve it and get stuck, you’ve reached an “impasse” and have no idea how to proceed. Or perhaps your efforts were just interrupted by something else. Either way, there is a “diversion,” or a break from the problem. Then, at some point, the diversion is itself interrupted by an aha moment that interjects the solution. This is insight, also called the stage of “illumination.”

13. On August 5, 1949, a team of fifteen firefighters led by foreman Wag Dodge was airlifted to Mann Gulch in Montana to extinguish what the men thought would be a relatively small brush fire on one side of the gulch. They parachuted onto the opposite side of the gulch, joined up with one fire guard, and started descending with the wind at their backs. Then, unexpectedly, the wind reversed, and the fire jumped over to ignite the grass on their side. The flames rapidly approached the men. They began to climb up the slope to try to outrun the fire. They paused briefly to drop their cumbersome equipment. But Dodge realized that this wouldn’t save them. The fire was moving too quickly. Dodge stopped. When the other firefighters saw this, they must have thought that he was giving up. They desperately continued their flight. But if Dodge did give up, it wasn’t for long, because he had a lifesaving insight. With his back to the flames, he took out a match and lit the grass in front of him. The dry grass caught fire immediately, and the wind blew this new fire up the side of the gulch and away from him, leaving a patch of charred ground. Dodge then crawled onto this patch and waited. When the brush fire arrived, it flowed around—and then away from—the burned ground that sheltered him. Dodge survived. Thirteen of the other fifteen firefighters perished.

14. Analytic problem solving is amenable to deadlines; creative insight is not.
   - Location: 1018-1018
   - Page: 67

15. insights can’t be forced. The unconscious thinking that culminates in a conscious insight doesn’t care about your deadline. If an answer is demanded of you before you’ve had your epiphany, then you won’t have an answer to give. The takeaway point is that you should neither expect nor demand outside-the-box thinking—from yourself or anyone else—on a strict timetable. Providing some structure can help to keep people on task, but creativity needs elbow room.

16. We found that at the moment a solution pops into someone’s awareness as an insight, a sudden burst of high-frequency EEG activity known as “gamma waves” can be picked up by electrodes just above the right ear.
   - Location: 1044-1045
   - Page: 69

17. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed a corresponding increase in blood flow under these electrodes in a part of the brain’s right temporal lobe called the “anterior superior temporal gyrus” (see figure 5.2), an area that is involved in making connections between distantly related ideas, as in jokes and metaphors.

19. The glare of the external world can block insights from emerging. Sometimes you have to isolate yourself and focus your attention inwardly to allow a new idea to surface. The brain can achieve this state of inward focus in several ways.
   - Location: 1214-1216
   - Page: 80

20. When the visual part of the brain doesn’t get much to work with, it idles at the slow alpha frequency.
   - Location: 1232-1233
   - Page: 81

21. The alpha burst is a “brain blink” that briefly cuts off visual inputs to the brain to reduce distraction. This allows one’s attention to find the new idea and jolt it into consciousness.
   - Location: 1248-1249
   - Page: 82

22. A brain blink helps by reducing visual distractions so that it’s easier to find and lock on to an insight. Fortunately, longer periods of sensory restriction can accomplish the same thing. It’s become a cliché, but many people have reported that they have had some of their best insights in the shower—perhaps the modern equivalent of Archimedes’s bath. The white noise of the running water is hard to focus on and blocks out other kinds of sounds. The warm water makes it difficult for you to feel the boundary between the interior and exterior of your body, so your sense of touch recedes from awareness. The visual inputs are unchanging and blurry. Perhaps your eyes are even closed to keep the soap out. Taking a shower is an excellent way to cut off the environment, focus your thoughts inwardly, and have an insight.

23. brain area called the “anterior cingulate” and located in the middle of the front of the head (see figure 7.3). We proposed that this area monitors the rest of the brain for the presence of competing ideas, especially the quiet, nonobvious ones. If the anterior cingulate detects the presence of shy alternative possibilities, then they won’t get squashed or overshadowed by the assertive ones and they can remain in play as contenders. Thus, the anterior cingulate is a key contributor to the insight mind-set—when this brain region is active, you are open to a broad range of potential solutions, even shy ones that don’t seem particularly promising at first.

24. the analytic mind-set. When your anterior cingulate is relatively inactive, you experience a form of mental tunnel vision: One or two obvious ideas upstage the shy ones.
   - Location: 1307-1308
   - Page: 86

25. Most everyday problems don’t need creative solutions anyway. It therefore makes sense to start with analysis. But in situations calling for outside-the-box ideas—that is, when you’ve exhausted the possibilities—you can use sensory deprivation to help you focus inwardly.
   - Location: 1317-1318
   - Page: 86

26. One way that sleep can incubate ideas and promote insight is by removing blocks that prevent a weakly activated idea from becoming conscious. Cognitive psychologists call this liberation of thought “fixation forgetting.”
   - Location: 1363-1364
   - Page: 89

27. incubation is real—if a person takes a break from a problem and returns to it later, then the break can increase the likelihood that she will solve the problem (relative to uninterrupted work).
   - Location: 1411-1413
   - Page: 93

28. every piece of information stored in your brain has associative connections to other pieces of information. “Dog” is connected to “bark” and “cat”; “Big Mac” to “fries” and “McDonald’s”; “movie” to “ticket” and “popcorn”; and so forth. When you let your mind wander, these associations bubble up into awareness as a loose sequence of thoughts—the stream of consciousness, in which each idea evokes the next idea in a chain. Some associations are generally stronger than others: The word “dog” would ordinarily be more likely to elicit the word “cat” from you rather than the word “battery.” However, influenced by your ongoing thoughts and environment, individual associations wax and wane in strength. For example, “dog” might suggest “catcher” or “pound” if you’re walking down the street, “hot” if you’re attending a baseball game and are hungry, “veterinarian” if you’re shopping at a pharmacy, or “battery” if you’re in a toy store. So how you think about something is determined not only by your past experiences and habits but also by the current state of your vast network of associations. These associations are like a pair of glasses that filter your perceptions of the world around you. They color what you see and make it easier for you to focus on some things rather than on others. But the state of your associations is malleable and constantly in flux.

29. Every time your circumstances change, so do your glasses. That’s how a change in context can help you see things in new ways. This view of the unconscious mind as a filter or spin doctor for the conscious mind, rather than as a hidden collaborator or servant, provides a plausible basis for theories of incubation.

30. “Zeigarnik effect”: An interruption improves memory for the unfinished task; but once completed, the odds of forgetting the task suddenly increase.
   - Location: 1475-1476
   - Page: 97

31. Colleen Seifert, David E. Meyer, and their colleagues went a step further: When you tackle a problem and fail to solve it, it sticks in your craw—and your brain. Seifert not only showed that you are more likely to remember problems that stumped you than problems that you were able to solve, but also proposed that the memory of an unsolved problem carries within it the seeds of its own solution. Their idea is that the failure to solve a problem stimulates your brain to store a special, easily retrieved memory of the problem and the failure. This memory is much more than a mental note. It energizes all of your associations to the information in the problem, sensitizing you to anything in your environment that might be relevant, potentially including the solution. Thus, when you encounter something that’s even remotely associated to the problem—a word, a sound, a smell—it can act like a hint that triggers an insight.
   - Location: 1477-1483
   - Page: 97

32. When you take a break from a problem, you’ll increase the odds that you will encounter an insight trigger if you expose yourself to a variety of stimuli and environments during your break.
   - Location: 1510-1511
   - Page: 99

33. To get the maximum benefit from a break, it helps if you “change your mind”—the greater the change, the better.
   - Location: 1558-1559
   - Page: 102

34. thinking about situations that are different from your current daily experiences can help to purge your mind of sticky thoughts. Out with the old; in with the new. Context is the key. Your memories are associated with the contexts in which you originally acquired them. If you learn something in one place, type of situation, or frame of mind, then you’ll remember that information better if you recall it later in the same context. That’s why you sometimes can’t remember the name of a person you know only from your office when you encounter that person at the shopping mall. (Cognitive psychologists call this the “butcher-on-the-bus phenomenon.”) So when you’re stuck in a rut and take a break to resolve the impasse, you’ll shed the misleading ideas more quickly and thoroughly if you think about things that transport your mind far from your current situation. Of course, actually getting away and taking a walk, especially on an unfamiliar route, would be an even better way to change context (as long as you aren’t thinking about the problem during your walk). But if you can’t get away, try thinking about getting away, to another town, another country, or, even better, another planet.
   - Location: 1563-1571
   - Page: 102

35. To sum up, failing to solve a problem sensitizes you to things in the environment that may subsequently trigger an insight. Taking a break when you are stuck or fixated can purge the wrongheaded perspective that traps you in a mental rut. Exposing yourself to a variety of experiences or thoughts—especially unusual ones—during a break will help you to dismiss these unproductive thoughts and increase your chances of encountering an insight trigger.
   - Location: 1575-1578
   - Page: 103

36. the best evidence indicates that incubation leads to shifts of perspective by tuning the strengths of the unconscious associations that filter our conscious perceptions. That’s why you should work on a problem until you solve it or get stuck. Only then should you take a break to cleanse your mental palette. And if you fall asleep during your break, then that can supercharge your ability to dismiss wrongheaded ideas and discover hidden relationships.
   - Location: 1582-1585
   - Page: 104

37. So take a break. Even better, get plenty of sleep. And dream. Perhaps it will help you to solve a difficult problem. If so, then write down the solution immediately!

It didn’t matter how a positive mood is induced: whether by giving people unexpected gifts or praise, having them recall happy experiences, having them watch comedy films, or having them listen to upbeat music.

43. look at the following two figures: Which one of those two figures is more like the next one? Take a moment to think about this. This test is used in laboratory experiments to assess how you are focusing your attention. There is no correct answer. If you’re attending broadly, you’ll think more about the overall pattern and say that the square made of triangles is more like the square made of squares. But if your attention is narrowly focused, you’ll tend to notice the parts rather than the whole and think that the triangle made of squares is more like the square made of squares.
   - Location: 1707-1713
   - Page: 112

44. Thinking, as well as seeing, can be narrow or broadly inclusive. Some of the same brain processes that regulate the breadth of visual attention also regulate the scope of a person’s “conceptual attention,” the ability to focus on ideas. Both perception and thought are narrowed by a negative mood and broadened by a positive mood.
   - Location: 1720-1723
   - Page: 113

45. Positive mood can have even wider effects. By broadening attention, happiness can help a person widen and integrate his or her knowledge of the world. Think of this as the flip side of weapons focus. Positive emotions such as tranquillity, joy, or love expand a person’s horizons by making things seem relevant and connected. This enables him or her to set aside habitual responses, explore the environment, and consider new opportunities and ways of thinking. Playing with your kids, enjoying the beauties of nature, listening to inspiring music, or walking through an art museum, for instance, will broaden your mind and your possibilities for interacting with the world,
   - Location: 1754-1758
   - Page: 115

46. Positive emotion and associative thought are flip sides of the same coin. We’ve seen how a positive mood improves a person’s ability to think with remote associations. Surprisingly, thinking with remote associations also improves a person’s mood. This is why people crave puzzles, detective stories, and the like. These things make them happy. Creative thought can even go so far as to have therapeutic benefits, as in art, music, and writing therapies.
   - Location: 1817-1820
   - Page: 119

47. Depression is an extreme state associated with intense analytic thinking about one’s problems. Just as far-ranging associative thought can improve a person’s mood and expand the mind, detail-oriented rumination can distill a person’s depression and focus the mind.
   - Location: 1839-1841
   - Page: 120

48. This general principle can also work for the average person whose mood swings aren’t extreme. To help you achieve a creative breakthrough, do things that make you happy. Take a walk in the park. Listen to music. But after you’ve had your aha moment, fun time is over. You’ll need to analyze and refine your new idea, and a state of bliss won’t help you to be at your critical best. In this case, a mild dose of anxiety may do the trick. To regain your critical edge, go see a scary movie, ride a roller coaster, or just watch the news—whatever makes you a little nervous.
   - Location: 1848-1852
   - Page: 121

49. intuition can play an important role in regulating your creative efforts. Even if you don’t know what your next insight will be, your brain might. If the idea is already brewing, your brain may tell you, through the experience of intuition, to hang on because it’s preparing to send you an idea that will arrive in due course.
   - Location: 1948-1951
   - Page: 128

50. Until recently, it was assumed that differences in cognitive ability were almost entirely due to analytic thought—the kind of thought measured by IQ tests. The idea was that people differ greatly in analytic ability; they don’t differ much in the kind of unconscious associative processes on which intuition is based. We now know that this view is wrong.
   - Location: 2169-2172
   - Page: 142

51. Psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman and his colleagues gave their participants a battery of cognitive tests, including both tests of analytical ability and tests of unconscious intuitive thought. Just as there are substantial differences among people in analytic intelligence, they also found substantial differences in intuitive ability. And these two types of cognitive ability weren’t strongly related to each other—just because you’re good at one doesn’t mean that you’re good at the other. Intuitives—people who are high in intuitive ability and are close relatives of our Insightfuls—have a particular type of personality. They are impulsive thinkers who appear to shoot from the hip. This is because the intuitions that they rely on can often be quicker than the lumbering methodical thought of Analysts. Intuitives are also high in a personality trait known as “openness,” which means that they tend to focus on their experiences of patterns and feelings rather than on their analytic thoughts.
   - Location: 2172-2179
   - Page: 142

52. Finally, even if you are an Intuitive, a cautionary note is in order. Intuition can be a powerful way to know the world. Trusting your hunches often works. It can let you sense the impressions, patterns, and ideas percolating in your unconscious mind. But many factors can create a false confidence that an intuition is valid. So when you have an intuition, don’t make an impulsive decision to either follow or reject it. Ask yourself why you are having that hunch, at that time, and at that place. The answers to these questions will help you to decide whether to trust a particular intuition. Remember, your brain knows more than you do, but it doesn’t know everything.
   - Location: 2188-2193
   - Page: 143

53. A pure type probably doesn’t exist; each person falls somewhere on an analytic-insightful continuum. Yet many—perhaps most—people tend to gravitate toward one of these styles, finding their particular approach to be more comfortable or natural.
   - Location: 2228-2229
   - Page: 146

54. First, creative people, including those who do well on paper-and-pencil tests of creativity as well as those with a track record of real-world creative achievement, tend to have habitually unfocused attention. This can make it difficult for them to shut out distractions, such as the sound of a nearby conversation, when they are trying to work. It’s not that they can’t focus when they need to. In fact, for relatively short periods, they can focus at least as well as other people, perhaps better. But this isn’t their natural state, so it’s a bit harder for them to sustain it.

55. This mutation therefore helps more people than it hurts (at least where malaria is present), which is probably why Darwinian natural selection hasn’t eliminated sickle-cell genes from the human genome. They’re worth keeping around. It’s been proposed that schizophrenia’s evolutionary origins and persistence across generations result from a similar mechanism. The full disease has no upside. However, a diluted dose of these genes can confer an advantage. People with schizophrenia genes that haven’t yet been fully activated by the environment (John Nash before his illness took hold), as well as people who have inherited a smaller number of these genes (speculatively, Ludwig van Beethoven), are not considered schizophrenic. The same is true of apparently healthy blood relatives of schizophrenics. Many such people are “schizotypes.” They aren’t mentally ill, though they may have watered-down versions of some of the unusual thought patterns that schizophrenics have, including—you guessed it—the tendency to think with remote associations. Schizotypes may often seem unconventional, slightly odd, and sometimes even brilliant. They make connections that others don’t, seeing the world in their own way.

57. when you purposely ignore something, even briefly, it’s difficult to immediately shift mental gears and pay full attention to it, a phenomenon called “negative priming.” This can sometimes be a minor inconvenience, but it occurs for a reason. When you ignore something, it’s because you deemed it to be unimportant. By inhibiting something that you’ve already labeled as irrelevant, you don’t have to waste time or energy reconsidering it. More generally, inhibition protects you from unimportant, distracting stimuli. Without it, your thoughts would wander all over the place, even retracing previous mental steps. Not coincidentally, schizotypes show little or no negative priming. Their reduced inhibition makes them susceptible to distracting, odd thoughts but also empowers their creative leaps.

58. you are at your inhibitory best during your peak time. This means that you are most analytical at your peak time and most insightful at your off-peak time. For creativity, your finest hour is literally the low point of your day.

59. stronger motivation decreases insightfulness.
   - Location: 2509-2509

60. Scientists have discovered two opposing motivational systems in the brain. The “approach system” draws you toward a goal, such as an appealing dessert you want to eat or an annoying person you want to confront. The “avoidance system” pushes you away from things like a threatening weapon or rotting food.
   - Location: 2513-2515
   - Page: 164

61. Even though these two systems drive your behavior in different directions, they have the same effect on your attention: they lock your mental spotlight on the object that you crave, fear, or loathe, and then they narrow the beam.
   - Location: 2518-2519
   - Page: 165

62. The key is that there are different kinds of motivation. One is about specific objects of personal significance: things such as cheese and owls draw you in or repel you, grabbing and narrowing your attention in the process. Another type of motivation is about you rather than about the objects around you. It comes in two flavors: prevention and promotion. As social psychologist E. Tory Higgins explains, these describe how you relate to the world. When you are oriented toward prevention, your central concerns are safety, responsibility, and the avoidance of pain or loss. (“I don’t want him to fire me.” “I’m playing it safe.”) A prevention mind-set banishes long-shot ideas and remote associations because they are risky. It narrows and focuses your mind on the most obvious features of your situation and recruits analytic thought to methodically evaluate what seems to be most important. It sticks with the tried and true. That’s why your attention is still constricted even after you’ve successfully evaded the owl—fleeing it has left you in a prevention mode. In contrast, a promotion orientation permits you to take risks because it starts from the presumption of safety. Since you believe yourself to be safe, you feel free to look at the world in terms of your hopes and possibilities for advancement. Promotion orients you to embrace creative, untested means of achieving your larger ambitions. (“I want to be something!”) And when you are oriented toward achievement, advancement, and progress, you experience a sense of adventure empowered by a feeling of safety. Dream big. Everything is possible. This broadens your mind to the universe of opportunities. It enhances and endorses creative leaps that can help you to achieve your vision.

63. Another example of extreme rewards and punishments in the business world is Jack Welch’s strategy when he was CEO of General Electric (1981–2001). Welch lavished stock options and bonuses on the top 20 percent of his managers. He also fired the bottom 10 percent of his managers annually. This policy may have enhanced managers’ analytic thought and general work output, but it’s unlikely to have contributed to the kind of consistent innovation that a technology company needs for long-term viability in the high-tech arena. Unsurprisingly, during Welch’s tenure as CEO, 40 percent of General Electric’s earnings came from GE Capital, the financial services division of the company, rather than from the more-famous technology side of its business.

66. What if the Soviet Union had never dissolved? What would the world be like if all disease were eliminated? These are examples of “counterfactual” thinking—that is, thinking about scenarios that contradict reality. “Additive” counterfactuals add something to a situation to create a new scenario: “If I had an umbrella, then I wouldn’t have gotten soaked.” Subtractive counterfactuals take something away: “If it hadn’t rained today, then I wouldn’t have gotten soaked.”

67. there was a positive association between insight and the amount of time spent living abroad, the critical distinction being whether a person had to adapt to another culture rather than just skim along its surface as a tourist. Furthermore, for those who had lived abroad, thinking about past experiences adapting to another culture provided an additional creativity boost.

69. Objects of thought are removed from you in time, space, social standing, and “counterfactuality” or “realness.” Thinking about things that are psychologically close to you—places that are nearby, people who are like you, events that will happen soon, your immediate reality—narrows your attention, prompting you to focus on salient details and biasing you toward analytic thought. Thinking about places that are far away, people who are unlike you, things that will happen in the distant future, and scenarios that are different from your current reality all broaden attention and benefit creative insight.

70. Only a mind broad enough to take in all the parts can reconfigure them to make a new whole. Psychological distance primes this mental broadening. Insightfulness often involves ramping up thought from the particular to the general,

71. The theft of Erik Verlinde’s valuables shook him out of his usual thought patterns so that he could leap beyond Newton’s and Einstein’s theories to reinterpret gravity as something yet more general and abstract: a by-product of the universe’s tendency toward disorder. So, to empower creative thought, you should imagine unusual people, alternate realities, and the distant future. Think about a loved one. Take in the view—and broaden it. Visit or envision faraway places and cultures. Ponder “what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.”
   - Location: 2734-2738
   - Page: 179

72. Everyone wants to be more insightful. But be forewarned: The Insightful faces obstacles. Be careful what you ask for. Jealousy, suspicion, and anxiety are common reactions to new ideas. People sometimes resist creative proposals simply because of a kind of prejudice toward their authors. (“Who does she think she is?”) Highly creative people can be difficult to comprehend because they often leap over many steps of reasoning. (“His thinking is all over the place.”) They can be seen as disruptive, even subversive, because they question established assumptions and procedures and seem distressingly ready to overturn the status quo. (“What’s her real agenda?”) Many highly creative people are schizotypes who are easy to view as odd and unpredictable. (“What’s he been sniffing?”) Moreover, many people don’t want their comfortable worlds upended, even when there is a possibility of betterment. (“What we have is good enough. Doesn’t she realize how risky that would be?”) These kinds of reactions often incite people to block Insightfuls from taking leadership roles or prevent their suggestions from receiving a fair hearing.

73. There have been only a handful of studies whose specific aim was to train people to solve problems insightfully. Their general goal tends to be to teach people to scrutinize the preconceptions that are the basis for their mental boxes. The idea is that by making yourself aware of your assumptions, you can systematically examine each one to ascertain whether it is correct or necessary. This will allow you to dismantle an incorrect perspective about a problem and construct a new understanding that will point to a solution.

74. You are more likely to have creative insights and valid intuitions when your brain is in a general state characterized by remote associations, broad flexible attention, abstract thought, positive mood, a sense of psychological distance, and a promotion orientation. Expansive surroundings will help you to induce the creative state. The sense of psychological distance conveyed by spaciousness not only broadens thought to include remote associations, it also weakens the prevention orientation resulting from a feeling of confinement. Even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention. Small, windowless offices, low ceilings, and narrow corridors may reduce expenses, but if your goal is flexible, creative thought, then you get what you pay for.
   - Location: 2879-2885

75. the ideal environment for creative thinking is open, airy, soft, rounded, and calm. Relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state; “emergency” colors such as red suppress it. Darkness or dim lighting also works because they obscure visual detail and shift thought toward generality, abstraction, and broad attention. This principle likely applies to the other senses as well, so relatively quiet surroundings are preferable. But when silence would lead to excessive drowsiness or when some noise is unavoidable, ambient noise should be soft, diffuse, and resistant to focus, such as the sound of ocean waves or the simultaneous murmuring of many people.

76. When you are stuck on a problem, take a break to do or think about something very different. The initial failure to solve a problem can sensitize you to things that can trigger an insight, so, during your break, expose yourself to a variety of people and places or change your activity. Perhaps listen to music or go to a pleasing movie, art exhibit, or creative performance. Play a game or attend a sports event. Dance. Do yoga. Read. Just do something else. Insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places to reveal analogies and other hidden connections among your ideas and experiences.
   - Location: 2915-2919
   - Page: 191

77. Perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental states can change, but they can’t turn on a dime. It takes a while to sink into an insightful mind-set. This means that switching back and forth between insightful and analytic thought can waste time and prevent you from fully engaging either state. Try to schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed, freewheeling creative thought. Turn off your cellphone. Get rid of the clock. Let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will. Be open to the patterns that emerge.

78. The default state helps propel your nascent ideas into consciousness even when you aren’t in that state. Helmholtz’s nature walks, Descartes’s late mornings in bed, Jerry Swartz’s playtime with his children, and Judah Folkman’s contemplation at his synagogue all culminated in moments of insight. But these types of activities are also powerful incubators for ideas that reveal themselves at other times. They also broaden thought and impart a creative momentum that persists even after one reengages with the world.

## Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins
**Author:** Garry Kasparov

### Highlights (22)

1. The elevator operators’ union was seventeen thousand strong in 1920, although its ability to paralyze cities with strikes like the one its members staged in New York in September 1945 surely cost them more than a few mourners when automatic push-button elevators began to replace them in the 1950s. According to the Associated Press, “Thousands struggled up stairways that seemed endless, including the Empire State Building, tallest structure in the world.” Good riddance, you might imagine. But the worries about operatorless elevators were quite similar to the concerns we hear today about driverless cars. In fact, I learned something surprising when I was invited to speak to the Otis Elevator Company in Connecticut in 2006. The technology for automatic elevators had existed since 1900, but people were too uncomfortable to ride in one without an operator. It took the 1945 strike and a huge industry PR push to change people’s minds, a process that is already repeating with driverless cars. The cycle of automation, fear, and eventual acceptance goes on.

2. humans are still playing chess, in fact more today than ever before. The doomsayers who said no one would want to play a game that could be dominated by a computer have been proven wrong. This seems obvious, considering how we also still play far simpler games like tic-tac-toe and checkers, but doomsaying has always been a popular pastime when it comes to new technology.

3. The willingness to keep trying new things—different methods, uncomfortable tasks—when you are already an expert at something is what separates good from great. Focusing on your strengths is required for peak performance, but improving your weaknesses has the potential for the greatest gains. This is true for athletes, executives, and entire companies. Leaving your comfort zone involves risk, however, and when you are already doing well the temptation to stick with the status quo can be overwhelming, leading to stagnation.

4. You might assume that the mathematicians, physicists, and engineers who formed the first wave of computer scientists and cyberneticists in the 1950s would hold little romanticism for a board game, even one they enjoyed passionately. And yet several of these eminently logical, scientific minds insisted that if a machine could be taught to play chess well, surely the secrets of human cognition would be unlocked at last. This sort of thinking is a trap into which every generation falls when it comes to machine intelligence. We confuse performance—the ability of a machine to replicate or surpass the results of a human—with method, how those results are achieved. This fallacy has proved irresistible in the domain of higher intelligence that is unique to Homo sapiens. There are actually two separate but related versions of the fallacy. The first is “the only way a machine will ever be able to do X is if it reaches a level of general intelligence close to a human’s.” The second, “if we can make a machine that can do X as well as a human, we will have figured out something very profound about the nature of intelligence.”

5. in 1957, a group of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University proclaimed that they had discovered the secret to a Type B–style chess algorithm that would lead to a machine defeating the world champion in just ten years’ time. Considering how slow computers were then, and how expensive, this was nearly as bold as John F. Kennedy’s declaration in 1962 that the United States would put a man on the moon by the end of the decade.

6. In contrast, a world-champion-caliber chess machine didn’t exist until 1997, thirty years after the Carnegie Mellon team’s predicted date, despite computer power doubling every two years, roughly in accord with Moore’s law.

7. Romanticizing the loss of jobs to technology is little better than complaining that antibiotics put too many grave diggers out of work. The transfer of labor from humans to our inventions is nothing less than the history of civilization. It is inseparable from centuries of rising living standards and improvements in human rights.
   - Location: 649-651

8. Human nature is simply out of sync with the nature of technological development. We see progress as linear, a straight line of improvement. In reality, this is only true with mature technologies that have already been developed and deployed. For example, the way Moore’s law accurately described the advances in semiconductors, or the way solar cell efficiency is improving at a slow but steady pace.
   - Location: 1031-1034
   - Page: 68

9. Before that predictable progress phase, there are two previous phases: struggle and then breakthrough. This fits the axiom of Bill Gates, “We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.” We expect linear progress, but what we get are years of setbacks and maturation. Then the right technologies combine or a critical mass is reached and boom, it takes off vertically for a while, surprising us again, until it reaches the mature phase and levels off.

10. Pablo Picasso, who said in an interview, “Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.” An answer means an end, a full stop, and to Picasso there was never an end, only new questions to explore. Computers are excellent tools for producing answers, but they don’t know how to ask questions, at least not in the sense humans do.

11. In 2014, I got an interesting response to this assertion. I had been invited to speak at the headquarters of the world’s largest hedge fund in Connecticut, Bridgewater Associates. In a revealing turn of events, they had hired Dave Ferrucci, one of the creators of the IBM artificial intelligence project Watson, famous for its triumphs on the American television quiz show Jeopardy. Ferrucci sounded disillusioned by IBM’s focus on a data-driven approach to AI, and how it wanted to exploit the impressive Watson and its sudden celebrity by turning it into a commercial product as quickly as possible. He had been working on more sophisticated “paths” that aimed at explaining the “why” of things, not only finding useful correlations via data mining. That is, he wanted AI to investigate beyond immediate practical results, and for those results to be revealing instead of simply an answer.
   - Location: 1088-1094

12. Ferrucci’s interjection during my lecture cut to the core of the matter as effectively as Picasso and Douglas Adams. He said, “Computers do know how to ask questions. They just don’t know which ones are important.”

13. more sophisticated algorithms are being developed to investigate the motivations and causations of events in data, not merely ranking correlations to answer search and trivia questions. But to know which questions are the right questions, you have to know what is important, what matters. And you cannot know that unless you know which outcome is most desirable.

14. I speak regularly about the difference between strategy and tactics, and why it’s essential to first understand your long-term goals so you don’t confuse them with reactions, opportunities, or mere milestones. The difficulty of doing this is why even small companies need mission statements and regular checkups to make sure they are staying on course. Adapting to circumstances is important, but if you change your strategy all the time you don’t really have one.

17. The law of diminishing returns is already having an impact. Getting a machine system to a 90 percent effectiveness rate may be enough to make it useful, but it’s often even harder to get it from 90 percent to 95 percent, let alone to the 99.99 percent you would want before trusting it to translate a love letter or drive your kids to school.

21. Igor Aleksander, a British AI and neural networks pioneer, explained in his 2000 book, How to Build a Mind, “By the mid-1990s the number of people with some experience of using computers was many orders of magnitude greater than in the 1960s. In the Kasparov defeat they recognized that here was a great triumph for programmers, but not one that may compete with the human intelligence that helps us to lead our lives.”

### Highlights (18)

1. Researchers have long been interested in the relationship between genome and—in the trendy parlance—phenome, that is, how what’s encoded in our DNA interacts with the environment to give rise to traits ranging from height to athletic prowess to behavior to assorted health conditions, be they cancers or various forms of male-pattern baldness.

Suddenly there was no gel; it had been replaced by capillary tubes into which the four sequencing reactions were injected. By the late 1990s, there were two commercial capillary platforms. Molecular Dynamics (later Amersham and eventually GE Healthcare) offered the MegaBACE beginning in 1998. In December of that year, Applied BioSystems (then PerkinElmer) began shipping its PRISM 3700, which was eventually succeeded by the 3730.

Even as late as 2009, Sanger-based DNA sequencing was still very much a growth business—oodles of cash were spent every year on half-million-dollar instruments and the various chemical reagents needed to keep them churning out the endless stream of A’s, G’s, T’s, and C’s, the simple digital DNA alphabet that encodes the tens of thousands of proteins that comprise life on earth.

You have to look at a higher level of organization … a movie critic doesn’t focus a magnifying glass on the little microscopic pits in a DVD… . I think there’s a lot of insight that you’ll gain about the human mind by looking at the whole human behaving, thinking and reporting on his own consciousness… . It may be that the historian, the cognitive psychologist and the biographer working together will give us more insight than someone looking at neurons and brain chemistry.”

The second one, however, he was not prepared to grant unconditionally. “If you were an airline pilot and you were susceptible to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, I wouldn’t want you to be an airline pilot,” he said. “Pilots are given stress tests every six months because a lot is riding on their health. Is it fair and appropriate to step into the realm of genetic testing for people whose genetic differences can affect the lives of others? It’s a complex question.”

9. by 2000, microarrays were beginning to be used for purposes beyond gene expression. Among the new applications was SNP detection, and this was even easier than gene expression. Instead of a curve measuring the extent to which a gene was expressed, genotyping was binary: In any given individual, was a particular DNA variant present or absent? And if present, was there one copy or two? By doing case-control studies on hundreds or thousands of people, say, half with a certain disease and half without, and by finding SNPs that were more frequently found in those with the disease, SNP scans could be used to identify disease susceptibility genes. The leap Cariaso and Lennon made was to take those findings and begin to apply them to individuals. Because once those genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were done on one or more populations, then hypothetically anyone could examine some fraction of her complement of SNPs and see whether she carried SNPs that raised or lowered her disease risks or otherwise contributed to her traits.

10. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man,25 an incredibly useful tool developed by the late Victor McKusick, the father of clinical and medical genetics. The catalog began as a hardcover book, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, in 1966.26 But even though it now lived online, OMIM was a text-based catalog, not a digital one, and it mostly contained diseases and phenotypes caused by rare changes in single genes: if a doctor in Saudi Arabia observed a child with widely spaced eyes and elevated enzyme levels in 1968 and published a case report, McKusick would make a note of it. The catalog was and is remarkably comprehensive: an astounding collection of our species’ variation.27 That said, I often found reading OMIM to be annoying: helpful and fascinating case reports and research studies were amassed under gene and/or disease headings and subdivided (“clinical features,” “animal models,” “pathogenesis,” etc.), but without any real narrative flow. At its best, it was like an Audubon field guide for clinicians—a terrific, handy reference. At its worst, it could be a painful slog for anyone interested in a high-level view of any particular genetic disease. I would be terribly upset if it didn’t exist, but as the great Irish writer Roddy Doyle said of Ulysses, it might benefit from a little more editing.

Transcriptomes were easier to work with than whole genomes because 1) they represent only 1 to 2 percent of the genome, “only” 60 million plus base pairs instead of 3 billion; and 2) they include much if not most of the “business end” of the genome: the parts that instruct the cell what proteins to make.

13. “If you can make a good soufflé, you can sequence DNA,” he told the Economist.76 He and Bea graced the cover of Nature.77 They appeared in Make, the do-it-yourselfer magazine.78 In 2009 they were in Wired.79 A presentation Hugh gave showed up on YouTube.80 And he launched MyDaughtersDNA.org, a website that pointed visitors to various accounts of Bea’s journey and invited parents, patients, and physicians “to describe for the other users of the site a case that needs some help.” A few of them have told their stories and shared their expertise.81 A geneticist in St. Louis read a description that a Bulgarian man had posted of his twelve-year-old daughter who lacked the ability to cry and suggested that she might have an extremely rare endocrine disorder known as Triple-A syndrome. She did; shortly thereafter she began hormone therapy. “To see a complete stranger solve another person’s problem,” said Hugh. “That was nice.”82 But the broader goal was to inform. Everything he’d written down went on the website: how to do PCR, how to pick primers, where to get something sequenced, how to navigate genomic databases. “I felt that just understanding what the steps were would demystify the process. Maybe no one would actually go from beginning to end, but people could understand every little step along the way. A lot of people don’t have the benefit of seeing a geneticist, let alone know what it is a geneticist does.”

14. If you are interested in which genes a cell or tissue is actually using, you would want to look at RNA, nearly all of which does something useful. First, however, you would enzymatically convert it to its DNA counterpart, complementary DNA (cDNA). Why not just sequence RNA directly? It can be done, but people generally don’t because it is very fragile. The half-life of RNA is usually measured in minutes. And it’s very easy to contaminate. DNA is much hardier and easier to work with.

In his outstanding 2007 New Yorker article and subsequent book, surgeon and medical writer Atul Gawande described the quixotic crusade of Dr. Peter Pronovost to have doctors follow a simple five-step checklist to avoid central-line infections in intensive care units.56 In its first fifteen months, the program saved $175 million and 1,500 lives, despite physician resistance to it. In 2009, eight years after it started, the checklist was finally rolled out in twenty-eight states.57 Clearly this quick, simple, and inexpensive intervention could make a difference.

18. The first step was for my DNA to be fractionated by a vibrating machine called a nebulizer into super tiny bits some 200–400 base pairs long—the DNA needed to be small before it could be amplified en masse in a later step. If the pieces were too big, they would take up too much room on the flow cell, the small glass slide where the business of DNA sequencing would get done. The ends of the DNA were “polished” enzymatically to make them uniform, and two unique adapters (short stretches of synthetic DNA) were attached to the ends with another enzyme (ligase) to the fragments. The adapters would allow the enzyme to recognize every fragment equally and sequence it. The fragments were then amplified by PCR (see chapters 5 and 9) to make sure there were sufficient ligated fragments for the actual sequencing reaction still to come. Once this step was done, the sample preparation steps were over: a “library” of my genome—millions of fragments with adapters attached—was ready. “Everything to this point is pretty straightforward,” Kevin said. “Illumina produces a kit for these steps and it’s basically idiotproof.”

## The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World
**Author:** David Eagleman

### Highlights (42)

1. Why do humans adapt to everything around us so quickly? It’s because of a phenomenon known as repetition suppression. When your brain gets used to something, it displays less and less of a response each time it sees it. Imagine, for example, that you come across a new object – say, a self-driving car. The first time you see it, your brain shows a large response. It’s absorbing something new and registering it. The second time you see it, your brain shows slightly less response. It doesn’t care quite as much about it, because it’s not quite as novel. The third time: less response again. The fourth time: even less. Repetition suppression in action.2 The more familiar something is, the less neural energy we spend on it. This is why the first time you drive to your new place of work, it seems to take a long time. On the second day, the drive feels a little shorter. After a while, getting to work takes almost no time at all. The world wears off as it becomes familiar; the foreground becomes the background.

2. there’s a problem with a lack of surprise. The better we understand something, the less effort we put into thinking about it. Familiarity breeds indifference. Repetition suppression sets in and our attention wanes. This is why marriage needs to be constantly rekindled.

3. Surprise engages us. It allows us to escape autopilot. It keeps us awake to our experience.
   - Location: 238-239
   - Page: 16

4. Surprise gratifies. This is why jokes are structured the way they are. It’s never two guys who walk into a bar – it’s always three. Why? Because the first guy sets things up, and the second guy establishes the pattern. This is the shortest possible path for the third guy to break the pattern by sidestepping the brain’s prediction. In other words, humor arises from the violation of expectations.

5. The joke only works because the brain always tries to predict, and the punchline knocks it off balance.
   - Location: 244-245
   - Page: 16

6. Brains seek a balance between exploiting previously-learned knowledge and exploring new possibilities. This is always a tricky trade-off.
   - Location: 255-256
   - Page: 17

7. Too much predictability and we tune out; too much surprise and we become disoriented. As we’ll see in the coming chapters, creativity lives in that tension.
   - Location: 270-271

8. The exploration/exploitation tradeoff also explains why our world is so densely populated with skeuomorphs: features that imitate the design of what has come before.
   - Location: 272-273

9. Our smartphones are packed with skeuomorphs. To place a call, we touch an icon of an old phone handset with an extruded earpiece and mouthpiece – a profile that departed the technology landscape long ago. The camera on your smartphone plays an audio file of a shutter sound, even though digital cameras don’t have mechanical shutters. We delete the zeros and ones of our apps by dragging them to the “trash can.” We save files by clicking on the image of a floppy disk – an artifact that has gone the way of the mastodon. We purchase items online by dropping them into a “shopping cart.” Such ties create a smooth transition from the past to the present. Even our most modern tech is tethered with an umbilical cord to its history.

10. Simulating futures comes with the benefits of safety: we try out moves in our minds before trying them out in the world. As the philosopher Karl Popper said, our capacity to simulate possible futures “allows our hypotheses to die in our stead.” We run a simulation of the future (what would happen if I stepped off this cliff?) and adjust our future behavior (take a step backward).

11. A context in which no one cares, no one pays attention, no one offers support or encouragement is a worst-case scenario for an aspiring creative. The go-it-alone artist, chronically cut off from his or her peers, is a mythical creature. Creativity is an inherently social act.

12. Consider graphic artist Lonni Sue Johnson, a prolific illustrator who designed covers for the New Yorker. In 2007, she suffered a nearly-fatal infection that crippled her memory.11 She survived, but found herself living in a fifteen-minute window of time, unable to recall her marriage, her divorce, or even people she’d met earlier in the day. The basin of her memories was largely emptied, and the ecosystem of her creativity dried up. She stopped painting because she could think of nothing to paint. No internal models swirled inside her head, no new ideas for the next combination of things she’d seen before. When she sat down in front of her paper, there was nothing but a blank. She needed the past to be able to create the future. She had nothing to draw upon, and therefore nothing to draw. Creativity relies on memory.

13. we propose a framework that divides the landscape of cognitive operations into three basic strategies: bending, breaking and blending.13 We suggest these are the primary means by which all ideas evolve. In bending, an original is modified or twisted out of shape. Szotynscy and Zaleski’s Krzywy Domek (‘Warped Building’) in Sopot, a Polish sea resort In breaking, a whole is taken apart. Yago Partal’s Defragmentados In blending, two or more sources are merged. Thomas Barbèy’s Oh Sheet! Bending, breaking and blending – the three Bs – are a way of capturing the brain operations that underlie innovative thinking.

14. Across business and industry, creativity is often shielded from view, because all that matters is that a tool does its job: the video streams properly, the app updates your traffic route, the smartwatch monitors how many stairs we’ve climbed. Innovation often conceals itself.
   - Location: 635-637
   - Page: 42

15. Overt creativity exposes the wires and ducts of invention; it enables us to see the internal mental processes that make innovation possible. Across diverse cultures, the most bountiful sources of overt creativity are found in the arts. Because the arts are intended to be exhibited, they are the open-source software of innovation.

16. Although Mother Nature only has the tools to pump blood around the body, there’s nothing to say that has to be the single solution. Cohn and Frazier wondered: what if one could use a continuous flow? Like water circulating in a fountain, could blood get oxygenated as it passed through a chamber, and flow right back out? In 2010, United States Vice President Dick Cheney was outfitted with a continuous flow heart, and he has been alive but pulseless ever since. A pulse is simply the byproduct of the heart’s pumping, but it’s not a necessity. Cohn and Frazier invented a new type of heart by taking nature’s prototype and putting it on the workbench.

17. Bending can remodel a source in many ways. Take size. Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen’s Shuttlecocks on the front lawn of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art are inflated to the size of teepees.

18. What can expand can also contract. Confined to a hotel room as a refugee during the Second World War, sculptor Alberto Giacometti went small, creating a series of tiny human figurines.
   - Location: 698-699
   - Page: 46

19. Many of us fall prey to the “end of time” illusion, in which we convince ourselves that everything that can be done has already been done. But the history of bending tells a different story: there is always infinitely more to squeeze out. Human culture is forever a work in progress.
   - Location: 791-794
   - Page: 52

20. bending is a makeover of an existing prototype, opening up a wellspring of possibilities through alterations in size, shape, material, speed, chronology and more. As a result of our perpetual neural manipulations, human culture incorporates an ever-expanding series of variations on themes passed down from generation to generation.
   - Location: 855-857
   - Page: 56

21. In breaking, something whole – such as a human body – is taken apart, and something new assembled out of the fragments.

22. An MIT computer scientist named John McCarthy came up with the idea of time sharing: what if, instead of running one algorithm at a time, a computer could switch between multiple ones, like cutting between different shots in a movie? Instead of users waiting their turn, several of them could work on the mainframe simultaneously. Each user would have the impression of owning the computer’s undivided attention when, in fact, it was rapidly toggling between them all. There would be no more waiting in line for a turn; users could sit at a terminal and believe they were having a one-on-one relationship with the computer. The shift from vacuum tubes to transistors gave McCarthy’s concept a boost, as did the development of user-friendly coding languages. But dividing up the computer’s computations into short micro-segments was still a challenging mechanical feat. McCarthy’s first demonstration didn’t go well: in front of an audience of potential customers, McCarthy’s mainframe ran out of memory and started spewing out error messages.3 Fortunately, the technical hurdles were soon overcome and, within a few years, computer operators were sitting at individual terminals in real-time “conversation” with their mainframes. By covertly breaking up digital processing, McCarthy initiated a revolution in the human-machine interface. Nowadays, as we follow driving directions on our phone, our handheld device draws on the processing power of numerous servers, each toggling rapidly between millions of users – McCarthy’s concept writ large in the cloud.

23. When we “cc” an email, we are employing a skeuomorph from the analog age: carbon copy. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, an author would clone a document by first placing a sheet of black or blue carbonic paper between two sheets of plain paper; then, by writing or typing on the top sheet, dry ink or pigment would be transferred to the lower one, creating a duplicate. But the carbon sheets were messy; it was hard to handle them without getting everything dirty. In the 1950s, inventors Barrett Green and Lowell Schleicher came up with a way to solve the problem. They broke the concept of the sheet into hundreds of smaller areas, inventing the technique of micro-encapsulation. This way, as a person wrote on the sheet, individual ink capsules would burst, turning the sheet below blue.4 Although it would still be called a “carbon copy,” Green and Schleicher had created a user-friendly alternative to carbon paper: no matter where the pencil or typewriter key made its impression, ink would flow. Decades later, photocopying spelled the end of carbonless paper, but Green and Schleicher’s micro-encapsulation technique lived on in time-release medications and liquid crystal displays. For instance, instead of a solid pill, the 1960s decongestant Contac consisted of a gelatin capsule packed with more than six hundred “tiny time pills” that were digested at different rates. Likewise, instead of a solid sheet of glass, today’s LCD televisions segment the screen into millions of densely arranged microscopic crystals. Things that were once thought to be whole and indivisible turned out to be breakable into smaller parts.

24. We remove letters and phrases to create acronyms such as FBI, CIA, WHO, EU and UN. We tweet F2F for face-to-face, OH for overheard, and BFN for bye for now. Our ease with these kinds of acronyms demonstrates how much brains like compression: we’re good at breaking things down, keeping the best bits, and still understanding the point. This is why our language is full of synecdoche, in which a part stands for a larger whole. When we talk about “the face that launched a thousand ships,” we obviously mean all of Helen, not just her visage – but we can break her down to a fragment without losing the meaning. This is why we describe your vehicle as your “wheels,” tally the number of people with a “head count,” or ask for someone’s “hand” in marriage. We talk about “suits” to represent businessmen, and “gray beards” to represent older executives.

25. As with dynamic architecture, one of classical music’s great innovations was to break musical phrases into smaller bits. Take as an example Johann Sebastian Bach’s Fugue in D-Major from The Well-Tempered Clavier. Here is the main theme: Don’t worry if you can’t read music. The point is that later in the movement Bach snaps his theme in two: he discards the first half and concentrates only on the final four notes highlighted in red. In the passage below, overlapping versions of this tail appear thirteen times to produce a rapid, beautiful mosaic of fragments. This kind of breakage gave composers like Bach a flexibility not found in folk songs such as lullabies and ballads. Rather than repeating the entire theme over and over, this shattering allowed him to write a packed multiplicity of theme-fragments in short order, creating something like the movie montages in Citizen Kane or Rocky IV. Given the power of this innovation, much of Bach’s work involved introducing themes and then breaking them apart.

26. In blending, the brain combines two or more sources in novel ways. All over the world, representations of humans and animals have been blended to create mythical creatures. In ancient Greece, a man and a bull were combined to create a Minotaur. For the Egyptians, human plus lion equaled the Sphinx. In Africa, merging a woman and a fish produced a mami wata – a mermaid. What magic happened under the hood to generate these chimeras? A new merger of familiar concepts.

27. As cognitive scientist Mark Turner writes, “Human thought stretches across vast expanses of time, space, causation, and agency … Human thought is able to range over all those things, to see connections across them, and to blend them.”

28. biomedical engineer Michelle Khine and her team came up with a surprising solution: Shrinky Dinks. This toy consists of plastic sheets that have been preheated and stretched so that they are big enough for a child to drawn on. When the sheets are reheated, they shrink back to their original size, turning the child’s artwork into a miniature. Using a laser jet printer and a toaster, Khine’s team found that they could inscribe channels into the Shrinky Dink, heat the plastic, and shrink it into a functional microfluidic dish.

29. By enabling different lines of thought to breed in novel ways, blending is a powerful engine of innovation. Although the animal kingdom achieves diversity through sexual blending, it is always constrained to genetically similar partners who are alive at the same time. In contrast, an individual human mind represents an enormous jungle of memories and sensations in which the mating of ideas is unconstrained.

30. When NASA engineers reversed the electric current aboard Apollo 13 to recharge the command module batteries, they were bending; so too was Picasso when he warped human bodies in Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. When the engineers tore apart equipment, they were breaking; so too was Picasso when he fractured the visual plane. When the engineers taped together cardboard, plastic, a sock and a hose to build an air filter, they were blending; so too was Picasso when he incorporated Iberian and African masks into his portrait. The engineers’ and artist’s raw materials were different, but they innovated by the same means: bending, breaking and blending what they knew. As a result they each made history, one with a daring rescue, the other with groundbreaking art. Bending, breaking, and blending are tools our brains use to turn experience into novel output; they are the basic routines in the software of invention. The raw materials are provided from every aspect of our involvement in the world: turns of phrase, musical riffs, toys, photos, eye-opening concepts and every memory we’ve ever accumulated. By intertwining the Bs, human minds ply, split and merge their experiences into new forms. Our civilization blossoms from these zigzagging branches of derivations, reassemblies and recombinations. But there’s another aspect to this: human brains constantly generate a surplus of new ideas, but most of them don’t catch on. Why do so many creative ideas fail to enter the social bloodstream? WHERE WE GO IS CULTURALLY CONDITIONED Not all creative ideas find an audience. Merely bending, breaking and blending is no guarantee that spectators will appreciate the end result. The act of creation is only half the story: the other half is the community into which that creation lands. Novelty is insufficient – what’s also required is resonance with one’s society.

31. Author Joyce Carol Oates describes the writing of novels as a kind of “massive, joyful experiment done with words and submitted to one’s peers for judgment.” And what your peers think of the experiment depends on the culture in which they’re embedded: the creations that are valued in any society depend on what has come before them. The products of our imagination are propelled by local history.

33. A composer of that era could have written a piece like Available Forms I, but it lay too far from cultural norms – and the possibility was therefore invisible to both the creators and their audiences. Because of the idiosyncrasies of its history, each location constrains the work that is produced there. Even as creative work strives for the eternal, it fundamentally depends on its milieu.

34. Renting a movie at a retail outlet had become a thing of the past. Like BlackBerry and Kodak, Blockbuster had held on to its right answer for too long. As the (former) employees of those companies will tell you, sometimes staying close to earlier successes is not enough – a big leap is what seizes the public imagination. That’s what happened when electric lighting replaced gas lighting, automobiles replaced horse-drawn carriages, talkies replaced silent movies, the transistor replaced vacuum tubes, and desktop computers replaced mainframes. So it may sound like disruption is the key. But that strategy runs aground as commonly as moves that are too gradual. GO TOO FAR AND NO ONE FOLLOWS

35. It’s a good habit to not commit to the first solution. The brain is a forest of interconnectivity, but because it is built for efficiency, it tends to land on the most well-trodden answer first; it’s difficult to catapult straight to the most unexpected ideas. Leonardo da Vinci would persistently distrust his first solution to any problem – suspicious that it was the result of overlearned routine – and dig around for something better.11 He always worked to derail himself from his path of least resistance, to discover what else was hidden in the richness of his neural networks.

37. Any company that wants to take the lead in innovation has to wrestle with this three-headed problem: the future is hard to foresee, most ideas die, and even great concepts may not last. So what do creative companies do?

38. As the industrial designer Alberto Alessi puts it, “The area of the ‘possible’ is the area in which we develop products that the customer will love and buy. The area of the ‘not possible’ is represented by the new projects that people are not yet ready to understand or accept.” Creative companies seek to operate at the border of the possible.

39. The principle of moving successively further away from a source is illustrated by Picasso’s and Lichtenstein’s bull series. Both artists began with realistic images, but each pushed away in a different direction: Picasso reduced the body to essential lines; Lichtenstein abstracted it into colorful geometric shapes. Looking at the final images of each series, it’s startling to see how far apart they end up. Bull series by Picasso 1946 Lichtenstein 1973

40. In a well-known experiment, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck gave a group of children a math test. Afterwards, half the children were praised for the scores they achieved; the other half were praised for the effort they put in. Then Dweck asked them if they would like to take a test at a slightly harder level. Those who had been praised for effort accepted the challenge. But those who had been praised for their scores backed off, not wanting to put their reputations on the line. Dweck concluded that by heaping praise on achievement, mentors inadvertently shackle the students’ risk-taking. Her take-away: praise efforts, not results.6 To shift away from focusing exclusively on results, students need the opportunity to wander off well-worn paths. In video gaming, “sandboxing” is the term for trying out options at a new level before competing – that is, a player can experiment with techniques and strategies before the game actually counts. A sandboxing approach can be applied to creative assignments: students are asked to come up with multiple options for something creative, but these aren’t graded, just reviewed. The student then picks her favorite to develop to completion. This not only encourages students to proliferate options, it also gives an opportunity to take chances without penalty.

Those responsible for keeping the nation safe need people to think of crazy ideas.”

Instead, he declared that only one name would be necessary. He would, now and forever, be known simply as the First Emperor of the Qin – Qin Shi Huangdi. In the event of his death, his successor would simply be the Second Emperor, his successor the Third, and so on, for ‘ten thousand generations.’

**Author:** Olivia Judson

### Highlights (1)

1. The plainfin midshipman, otherwise known as the California singing fish, takes this to extremes. Males have either big brains or big balls. The brainy kind excavate cavelike nests beneath rocks in the intertidal zone. Once a male has prepared a nest, he hums to attract females. A single humming bout can last for a quarter of an hour. Thus, he has large muscles for humming and extra neurons to control the muscles. When a female arrives, she slowly lays her eggs on the ceiling of the nest; as she does this, the male quivers beside her every few minutes, a sign he is releasing sperm. When she’s done—which can be as long as twenty hours after the laying of the first egg—he throws her out of the nest so that he can guard the fertilized eggs and sing to attract more females. The other type of male—the one with the big balls—sneaks into the nest at the crucial moment. These fellows can’t hum: they lack the mental and physical apparatus. The best they can do is grunt. But boy, are they well hung! As a proportion of his weight, a sneak has gonads nine times heavier than a brainy male does. His gonads are so large that his stomach bulges as if he’s pregnant. No wonder he grunts. So you brainy types out there shouldn’t feel too smug. Your position is only safe if sneaks are rare. If sneaks are common, then you’re at greater risk of sperm competition and should invest more in making sperm. Thus you should have larger balls.

## Shapes: Nature's Patterns: A Tapestry in Three Parts by Philip Ball (2011-07-07)
**Author:** Philip Ball

### Highlights (4)

1. surface tension still pulls on a soap bubble and gives it a tendency to shrink. But the pressure of the air trapped inside opposes this shrinkage, and at some point the inward force of the surface tension is exactly balanced by the air pressure, and the bubble achieves its equilibrium size. A soap bubble also feels the pull of gravity, which drags the water in the film towards the bottom of the bubble. This gradually thins the upper film until it reaches a point where it is too thin to remain stable: the film ruptures and the bubble pops. Interference of light reflected from the front and back faces of these films creates colours that depend on the film’s thickness. These can give rise to swirling patterns of colour in soap bubbles, which turn silvery and then black as the film thins to breaking point.
   - Location: 838-844
   - Page: 55

2. When two soap bubbles come together, they coalesce and are flattened at their point of intersection. This partition is perfectly flat only if the two bubbles are of the same size, because the gas pressure inside a bubble depends on its radius: the smaller the radius, the greater the pressure. So a small bubble has a higher internal pressure than a larger one, and when they coalesce the partition between them will bulge out into the larger bubble

3. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy is ‘conserved’: the total energy of the universe always remains the same.** Thus, energy is not lost when a boulder rolls downhill. The boulder’s potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy—the energy of movement—as well as into some acoustic energy (the noise of its rolling) and heat (due to friction with the ground and the air). When the boulder comes to rest, the deficit in potential energy is then accounted for more or less entirely by heat. So if such processes are not truly driven by a tendency to minimize energy, what is causing the change to happen? The answer is entropy.

4. You have never in your life experienced true personal equilibrium, for if you had, your life would be over. Equilibrium is deathly; nothing happens there. Equilibrium for the universe means Clausius’s heat death, a cosmos rendered totally homogeneous. Scientists care about equilibrium states, but to the rest of our world they are anathema. All life exists out of equilibrium, and as Lotka observed, this is ultimately made possible on Earth by the continual flux of energy from the sun. This is what makes the planet itself come to life. It is why water circulates between the sky and the seas, why the winds blow, why plants grow and why the biosphere sustains the atmosphere in a state of extreme disequilibrium. You cannot keep an atmosphere full of a compound as reactive as oxygen for millions of years without some non-equilibrium process to replenish it: it would otherwise react with rocks and get bound up in the solid earth. This is why scientists searching for life on other planets believe that an atmosphere with a high oxygen content is a likely signature.

## Why?: What Makes Us Curious
**Author:** Mario Livio

### Highlights (25)

1. the pathways within our brain that are responsible for the reaction to surprise or fear. When we encounter the unexpected, the brain assumes that some action may have to be taken. This results in a rapid activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with its familiar, associated manifestations: increased heart rate, perspiration, and deep breathing. At the same time, attention is diverted from other, irrelevant stimuli and is focused on the key pressing element under consideration. LeDoux was able to show that in surprise, and in particular in fear response, fast and slow pathways are concurrently activated. The fast track proceeds directly from the thalamus, which is responsible for relaying sensory signals, to the amygdala, an almond-shaped cluster of nuclei that assigns affective significance and directs the emotional response. The slow track involves a lengthy detour between the thalamus and the amygdala that passes through the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of neural tissue that plays a key role in memory and thought. This indirect route allows for a more careful, conscious evaluation of the stimulus and for a thoughtful response.

5. prevailing Western theory. The latter was dominated until the sixteenth century by the teachings of the second-century CE Greek physician Galen of Pergamum. Galen concluded that the heart was not a pump, but rather acted as the body’s vitalizing fireplace, generating internal heat. Ironically, even though Galen himself was an extremely curious person who based his anatomical observations on actual dissections of monkeys, pigs, and dogs, most of his followers blindly accepted his conclusions for more than a millennium. Just as Aristotelian views reigned supreme in the physical sciences, and the Ptolemaic geocentric model of the solar system remained unchallenged, so in anatomy Galen’s theories were considered sacred. It is as if curiosity had frozen solid during the Middle Ages.

6. According to Galen, when the heart dilates, it draws air from the lungs. This air passes into the left ventricle, where it mixes with blood, producing “vital spirits” by virtue of the “innate heat.” When the heart contracts, the blood and vital spirits exit through the arteries, reaching and “vivifying” all the tissues. Leonardo’s interest in the heart was so profound that he devoted more space in his notebooks to the heart than to any other organ (Figure 8 shows two of his drawings of the heart, probably of an ox). Unfortunately, even he couldn’t totally rid himself of Galen, with whose ideas he had become acquainted mostly through the works of the tenth-century Persian polymath Avicenna (Latinate form of Ibn-Sina) and the thirteenth-century Italian physician Mondino de Luzzi.

7. it is precisely this unusual ability to move from one extreme to the other, to express both ends of the continuum of a trait, that Csikszentmihalyi identifies as the main quality that distinguishes creative personalities from others. He terms this peculiarity “complexity.” In his words, “Instead of being an ‘individual,’ each of them [creative people] is a ‘multitude.’ ” As an illustration of what he means by “complexity,” Csikszentmihalyi lists pairs of apparently opposing characteristics that creative people paradoxically seem to exhibit. These include, for instance, great physical activity coupled with frequent periods of quiet and rest; responsibility and irresponsibility; the ability to alternate between imagination and fantasy on one hand, and a rooted sense of reality on the other; opposite tendencies on the range between extroversion and introversion; and even “psychological androgyny,” an uncommon combination of mannerisms typically classified as “feminine” with others classified as “masculine.”

8. being curious and being creative are one and the same thing? Even though people often confuse the two characteristics, they are not identical. A creative person is someone whose ideas or activities significantly change an existing cultural domain or create a new one. Simply being curious is not a sufficient condition for creativity. Curiosity does appear, however, to be a necessary condition for creativity.

11. a necessary condition for keen curiosity appears to be an information-processing ability. To be prodigiously curious about as many topics as Leonardo and Feynman were (“he delighted in curiosity about nature,” Joan Feynman told me about her brother) requires not only superior cognitive capacity but also brain mechanisms that assign great value to learning and to acquired knowledge. Those, in turn, necessarily entail highly efficient processing of data.

12. I shall initially adopt as the definition of curiosity the rather broad formulation suggested by University of Rochester cognitive scientists Celeste Kidd and Benjamin Hayden: curiosity is a drive state for information. Even more simply: curiosity is the desire to know why, how, or who.
   - Location: 786-788
   - Page: 52

13. psychologist Daniel Berlyne mapped curiosity onto a two-dimensional grid. On one axis curiosity reached from the specific (the desire or need for distinct information) to the diversive (the ceaseless seeking of stimulation to ward off boredom). The other axis ran from perceptual curiosity (aroused by surprising, ambiguous, or novel stimuli) to epistemic curiosity (the genuine yearning for new knowledge).
   - Location: 828-831
   - Page: 54

14. Berlyne made another seminal and enduring contribution to the study of curiosity, with the identification of a class of distinct factors that, in his view, determined whether or not something was interesting and worthy of exploration. These factors are novelty, complexity, uncertainty, and conflict.
   - Location: 845-847
   - Page: 56

15. George Loewenstein put forward a contemporary theoretical version of these concepts—an extremely influential framework that has become known as the “information-gap theory.” The basic idea behind this scenario for the explanation of curiosity is simple (once it is pointed out!). It commences with the reasonable assumption that individuals have some preconceived notions about the world surrounding them, or for that matter, about any given topic, and that we seek coherence. When we encounter some facts that appear to be incompatible with our prior actual or imagined knowledge, with our internal predictive model, or with our prejudices, a “gap” is generated. We experience this gap as an aversive state, an unpleasant sensation. Consequently, we are driven to investigate and seek new insights that will reduce the uncertainty and feeling of ignorance. According to this view, curiosity and the ensuing exploratory behavior are not goals in themselves. Rather, they are the means through which we attempt to reduce the uncomfortable sensation caused by uncertainty and confusion. In Loewenstein’s own words, curiosity is “a cognitive induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge and understanding.”
   - Location: 867-876
   - Page: 57

16. while specific curiosity may be satisfied if a certain desired piece of information is provided, curiosity in general (in particular epistemic curiosity) and the tendency to explore are actually never truly satiated. Psychologists have also spotted a few additional problems with the information-gap theory, again if it is taken to be an all-encompassing theory of curiosity. First, it regards curiosity as always being associated with a negative, aversive, unpleasant state. But many experiments on exploratory behavior point to novelty and variety as often being perceived as positive and enjoyable experiences that fuel excitement and attentiveness.
   - Location: 927-932
   - Page: 61

17. Even uncertainty, the key ingredient driving the information-gap model, does not always have a negative effect, or no one would read murder mysteries or engage in any whimsical activity. While it is undoubtedly true that uncertainty can be discomforting—for example, when one is awaiting the results of a medical test that could confirm or eliminate suspicion of a serious illness—uncertainty about the source of a positive effect could lead to prolonged pleasure.
   - Location: 934-937
   - Page: 61

18. A second, related problem that the information-gap theory raises is this: Given that people do occasionally become proactively curious, one could metaphorically invoke a version of Newton’s first law of motion, “A body at rest stays at rest,” to wonder why anybody would become curious if that is tantamount to asking for an unpleasant sensation.
   - Location: 957-959
   - Page: 63

19. third problem has to do with the presumed universality of the information-gap theory. That is, even if the basic premise of the theory is correct, at the very least it appears to be an oversimplification, especially when it comes to different types of curiosity.
   - Location: 962-963

20. curiosity may be a powerful source of motivation for its own sake, intrinsic motivation, with no control from any external or internal pressure, and with no apparent reward except for the activity itself.
   - Location: 1058-1059
   - Page: 69

21. Charles Spielberger and Laura Starr proposed an optimal stimulation/dual process scenario. In their theory (which, like Loewenstein’s framework, incorporated a few of Berlyne’s earlier ideas), optimal arousal is achieved as a result of two competing processes. Novel, complex, or incongruent phenomena arouse both a state of curiosity that is perceived as pleasant and an anxiety that is aversive. Spielberger and Starr suggest that when the intensity of the external, triggering stimulus is low, curiosity dominates—along with a desire to explore. At moderate levels of incentive intensity, the fusion of high (pleasant) curiosity and moderate (unpleasant) anxiety tends to trigger specific exploration, that is, a search for distinct pieces of information. Finally, for very powerful stimuli, when we see something that is totally unexpected or extremely confusing, the level of anxiety becomes so high that it motivates total avoidance rather than exploration.
   - Location: 1064-1071
   - Page: 70

22. Spielberger and Starr’s optimal arousal model also leaves a few questions unanswered. The problem is with there being an “optimal” arousal state, which implies that this is a desirable condition to be in. However, if such a state exists, it is not clear why anyone would want to have his or her inquiries, mysteries, and puzzles resolved if that would reduce the positive experience of curiosity to a level of arousal that is less than optimal.

23. “My greatest joy is when I learn something new.” This is precisely what defines an intellectually curious person.

24. Put differently, being “infovores” and wanting to learn is a constant characteristic of humans, but the willingness to take risks for novelty, thrill, or adventure and the ability to be surprised decrease as we grow older.

The working brain can therefore be mapped in detail by taking snapshots of the changes in the blood flow, using the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast—the fact that oxygenated blood has different magnetic properties from deoxygenated blood and that the relative difference can be imaged.

## The Mind Club: Who Thinks, What Feels, and Why It Matters
**Author:** Daniel M. Wegner;Kurt Gray

### Highlights (60)

1. people see minds in terms of two fundamentally different factors, sets of mental abilities we labeled experience and agency.13 The experience factor captures the ability to have an inner life, to have feelings and experiences. It includes the capacities for hunger, fear, pain, pleasure, rage, and desire, as well as personality, consciousness, pride, embarrassment, and joy. These facets of mind seemed to capture “what it is like” to have a mind—what psychologists and philosophers often talk about when they discuss the puzzle of consciousness. A mind with experience can feel what it is like to touch a hot stove, can enjoy going to the circus, and can have an orgasm.* The agency factor is composed of a different set of mental abilities: self-control, morality, memory, emotion recognition, planning, communication, and thought. The theme for these capacities is not sensing and feeling but rather thinking and doing. The agency factor is made up of the mental abilities that underlie our competence, intelligence, and action. Minds show their agency when they act and accomplish goals. A useful framework to help understand the differences between experience and agency is inside and outside. Experience is what minds are like from the inside, what it feels like to be a person, or a cat, or a bat. Because experience is a matter of being inside a mind, it can be very elusive to others. In contrast, agency is more transparent because it is what minds are like from the outside. We can determine an entity’s ability to plan and think simply by observing its actions and reactions. Said another way, experience is about inputs, as sensations and feelings generally are conveyed by sense organs like eyes and ears that feed in to minds. Conversely, agency is about outputs, movements and actions that feed out of minds.

2. in the bottom right, we have the Almighty. As you might expect, God is perceived as very able to do things, but is, curiously, seen to have little experience. God’s mind may be great, but we don’t believe that He can feel hunger, fear, or even joy like the rest of us. Interestingly, in a replication of the mind survey, we discovered that corporations are seen to occupy the same location on the mind map. Like God, Google was seen as all agency and no experience.

3. mind perception forms the very basis for questions of life and death: entities with minds deserve moral consideration, whereas entities without minds do not. But if mind perception is split into agency and experience, how do these two factors relate to morality? To answer this question, we ask you to consider a thought experiment called “Baby vs. Robot.” It’s not about babies and robots fighting* but instead about two moral scenarios. In the first, imagine that the baby and the robot were just about to tumble off a cliff and you could save only one of them. Which would you save? Likely you would save the baby and let the robot fall to its doom. In the second scenario, imagine that the baby and the robot have found a loaded gun and are playing with it, when it goes off and injures someone. Which of them would you hold responsible? If you’re like most people, you would forgive the baby and condemn the robot to the junkyard. These two scenarios reveal that it is no fun being a robot, and also that someone needs to call child services on that baby’s parents. But most important, these scenarios demonstrate that there are two distinct kinds of moral status, not one. Questions of moral responsibility (Who deserves responsibility and punishment?) seem to be distinct from those of moral rights (Who deserves protection from harm?) because we protect the baby from harm and yet hold the robot morally responsible.

4. These two types of moral status (rights and responsibilities) not only are distinct but also map perfectly onto our two-dimensional mind map. To have moral rights you need to have experience, an inner life filled with feelings, and the potential for suffering. Conversely, to be morally responsible you need to have agency, to be able to plan, act, and appreciate the outputs of your thoughts. Babies have more experience than robots and so have more moral rights; robots have more agency than babies and so have more moral responsibility.

5. Thinking doers are active minds with moral responsibility that do actions, minds like corporations and God. Vulnerable feelers are passive minds with moral rights that have actions done to them, minds like puppies, medical patients, and babies. This division of doer and feeler should feel intuitive because it is as ancient as human thought.
   - Location: 231-233
   - Page: 16

6. Agents and patients crisply divide the moral world into two, but remember that they are complementary opposites: agents act upon patients, and patients are acted upon by agents.
   - Location: 246-247

7. Linking mind perception to morality not only explains the enduring hilarity of kids injuring unsuspecting adults but also allows you to predict your moral outrage about almost any infraction. Tough man (high agency) punches kitten (high experience)? Immoral. Kitten (low agency) scratches tough man (low experience)? Not immoral. When you become enraged at an instance of moral depravity, chances are someone very agentic is harming someone (or something) very patientic. This idea of dyadic morality will be important throughout the book as we explore our different reactions to cryptominds causing and receiving harm, such as child-killing pigs and medical patients left to die.
   - Location: 275-280

8. Many animals also seem to have a concept of the “self,” demonstrated by the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror. In humans this capacity doesn’t emerge until the age of eighteen to twenty-four months.36 To test this with your own child, put a big red mark on his forehead before sitting him in front of the mirror. If your kid madly rubs at his own forehead, he has the power of self-recognition, but if he just chuckles and thinks, “Look at that dumbass,” he has yet to approach the intellectual sophistication of chimps, dolphins, and elephants.
   - Location: 506-511
   - Page: 33

9. How do people decide which animals count as moral patients? With mind perception, of course. Animals perceived to have mind are given moral rights, whereas those without aren’t. It may seem that we base membership in the mind club on agency, as laws to protect apes and dolphins often reference their intelligence.50 For example, in 2008 the Spanish parliament passed a nonbinding resolution giving basic human rights to great apes, who are among our closest genetic relatives. This law prevents cruelty to apes and forbids their killing except in cases of self-defense. Proponents of the law cited the apes’ advanced cognitive abilities—but also their ability to feel fear, jealousy, and love.

10. The truth is that people extend more protection to kittens than crows, despite the fact that corvids are much smarter. This suggests that animal rights are more a matter of experience than of agency—an idea confirmed by our mind survey, which revealed that animals are seen as vulnerable feelers. This importance of experience is captured eloquently by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, who wrote that “the question [of animal rights] is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?”52

11. Our need to feel social connection explains why people often embellish their relationships with other people. Every time you think of celebrities as close friends or imagine that you and your hunky mail carrier have a deep personal connection, you are creating what are called “parasocial relationships.” Unlike normal two-sided relationships, parasocial relationships are felt by only one person—but to that one person they are undoubtedly real, even when they involve characters on TV. Loneliness makes people imagine a loving bond with other minds, and this love can make even imaginary minds real.

12. the tendency to see mind in technology occurs primarily when it disobeys our desires.9 When machines function smoothly, we feel in control, but when they misbehave, we see mind to help us understand. This is also true with people. When your toddler is being a good kid, you don’t think hard about why that’s the case. But when he’s screaming and flinging his dinner around a French restaurant, you immediately try very hard to figure out his motivations and thoughts on the matter. People are more likely to think of their old Chevy truck as being in the mind club than their brand-new Audi, despite the Audi’s fancy technology. The Audi does everything exactly as it should—and so is seen as lacking mind—but that old “girl” needs encouragement, cajoling, and sometimes just a sensitive ear to listen to her. Psychologist Carey Morewedge calls this phenomenon a negativity bias in mind perception—negative events prompt mind perception more than positive events.
   - Location: 794-801
   - Page: 52

13. bad outcomes lead people to search for an agent to blame for mistreatment—a phenomenon called dyadic completion. The negativity bias in mind perception can actually be explained as part of dyadic completion, as people search for an agentic mind to take the blame when they feel vulnerable and exploited.
   - Location: 814-816
   - Page: 54

14. Setting aside our general tendency for anthropomorphism, we seem to have two broad motivations for perceiving mind: feeling lonely and craving control.

15. This phenomenon is called transactive memory,14 and spouses use it all the time. One person may take responsibility for knowing everything about gardening, while the other may know everything about cooking. One person remembers the birthdays of the extended family, whereas the other remembers to take the car in for regular maintenance. Like the distribution of labor that fueled the Industrial Revolution, this distribution of memory makes economic sense. Why remember everything half as well when you can remember half the things twice as well?

16. Kurzweil, for his part, is banking on the idea that once computers become all-powerful, they will be benevolent. He expects to be able to upload his consciousness into a computer and live immortally in the Internet, in harmony with machines. Of course, anyone who has spent time with a three-year-old understands that our creations often don’t go as planned, as trips to the mall often end in fierce tantrums and the attempted destruction of entire shopping aisles. Who knows what would happen with a tantrum-throwing superagent in control of air-traffic systems; just the idea of such sentient technology may give you the creeps.
   - Location: 909-914

17. being a patient—or having patiency—is broader than just medicine. Patients are perceived to have experience and to be sensitive and susceptible to the actions of others. Whereas agents are the thinking doers of the world, patients are the vulnerable feelers. Of course, medical patients are also patients in this broader sense, but when we use the word “patient” we mean those entities at the top (and especially the top left) of the mind survey—people, children, and puppies.

18. Of all human experiences there is nothing more real, more present, and more captivating than pain. Whether caused by a toothache, a thrown back, or a deep cut, pain melts away the outside world, filling your whole consciousness with its reality. Complex thoughts, plans, and memories all vanish when you slam the car door on your hand.2 Even emotional pain, whether from a loved one’s death or a sudden breakup, demands all our attention.
   - Location: 1171-1175
   - Page: 77

19. Pain may have overwhelming psychological power, but its physical reality is comparatively insubstantial. Pain is a mental construction based on a handful of nerve signals, the same kind of signals that let us experience green or yellow or smell lavender or chocolate. We might imagine that when in pain our cells secrete some terribly corrosive brain chemical, but the intensity of our suffering stems only from the microscopic electrical pulses of neurons. These neurons are typically triggered by external tissue damage, in a biological pathway that starts at the location of the cut, burn, or bruise, then proceeds through a neural “gate” in the spinal cord before arriving into the thalamus, the sensory hub of the brain.
   - Location: 1177-1182
   - Page: 77

20. Neuroimaging studies suggest that pain has two distinct components, a sensory component and an affective component. The sensory component represents actual tissue damage and the “burning,” “cutting,” and “throbbing” aspects of pain.20 The affective component of pain is its felt badness, its aversiveness or unpleasantness. These two components are usually related—burning sensations are seldom pleasant—but they can be dissociated. For example, morphine eliminates the aversive affect while keeping the sensory experience.
   - Location: 1216-1221
   - Page: 80

21. The disconnect between physical damage and mental discomfort means that other people’s pain is especially shrouded in mystery. Pain—like all forms of experience—is felt only from the inside and so is ultimately inaccessible to others. Of course, that doesn’t stop people from trying to understand when others might be in pain.
   - Location: 1225-1227
   - Page: 80

22. There are two routes through which we can understand the experience of others, whether it involves pain, pleasure, or the taste of fish. The first route is illustrated by the question “Does Jennifer like pickled sardines?” Without knowing anything about Jennifer, you’ve likely got an answer, and it’s probably the same answer to whether you like pickled sardines (i.e., “no”). To understand Jennifer you use simulation, relying on your own imagined experiences (e.g., I don’t like sardines) as a proxy for those of others (e.g., others don’t like sardines).23 The second route is illustrated by a slightly different question, “Does Olga like sardines?” Now you might come up with a different answer (i.e., “yes”), because the name “Olga” suggests a mysterious foreigner whose tastes might swing toward slimy fish pickles. To understand Olga you use theorizing, which, unlike your imagination, uses explicit theories about others’ minds, such as “Russians like strange foods.” Simulation is the easier of the two routes, and so we rely on theorizing only when others are very different from us (e.g., Russian), rendering invalid our self-focused simulations.
   - Location: 1227-1236
   - Page: 81

23. Simulation may sometimes lead us astray, but—much more than theorizing—it makes us care about the mental states of others. Theorizing uses cold theories about stimuli and responses—if shocked, then pain—but simulation uses our own feelings to predict those of others. In terms of our two dimensions of mind perception, simulation is grounded in our own experience (feeling their pain), whereas theorizing is grounded in our own agency (reasoning about their pain). It is simulation that gives rise to empathy.

24. Continually receiving help reduces self-esteem and feelings of control, leading to feelings of helplessness and reduced agency.47 To reestablish this agency, patients need to become the givers of care, transforming into agents with increased self-confidence and personal power. It is no coincidence that twelve-step programs—whether for alcoholism or gambling addiction—involve sponsorship, in which senior members become shepherds for new members. By taking responsibility for another, you break through the mantle of victimhood, moving from one side of the mind-perception fault line to the other. Helping others turns you from a vulnerable feeler into a thinking doer.
   - Location: 1366-1371
   - Page: 90

25. Beyond conferring feelings of agency, a study by Stephanie Brown at the University of Michigan revealed that helping others can add years to your life. Brown examined the mortality of older people who were the primary caregivers of their ill spouses. This is an incredibly stressful role because caregivers must manage every aspect of their spouse’s treatment and take ultimate responsibility for the spouse’s life. As stress is linked to an early death, the obvious prediction would be that caregivers would die earlier than noncaregivers—but they lived significantly longer, presumably because of increased feelings of agency.48 Even taking care of plants can increase longevity. In one study, nursing home residents given responsibility for a houseplant outlived those who had plants that were looked after by nursing home staff.49 This may also explain why parenthood transforms the cowardly into the brave—children are the moral patients who turn moms and dads into powerful moral agents.

26. Gandhi was first a moral patient, suffering discrimination and beatings at the hands of the European ruling class. By committing himself to helping others, he turned from patient to agent, a process we call moral transformation.
   - Location: 1389-1390
   - Page: 91

27. It seems that being a moral patient reduces agency, and being a moral agent reduces patiency. When we see others—and ourselves—as vulnerable feelers, it is hard to see them as thinking doers; and when we see others—and ourselves—as thinking doers, it is hard to see them as vulnerable feelers. This inverse relation between perceptions of agency and patiency (i.e., experience) is called moral typecasting.
   - Location: 1399-1402
   - Page: 92

28. Typecasting is a frequent phenomenon in Hollywood, where the lovable jokester can’t be taken seriously in a dramatic role and the goofy best friend can’t be the main love interest. Perhaps the most powerful example of this was Leonard Nimoy as Spock. In real life Leonard Nimoy was passionate and playful, but people forever saw him as a cold and unfeeling personality because he played a Vulcan on Star Trek. Chafing against this typecasting, Nimoy entitled his first autobiography I Am Not Spock, but in the end he resigned himself to the role’s power and entitled his second autobiography I Am Spock.

30. In contrast to anthropomorphism, which involves the ascription of human qualities to animals and objects, this chapter explores dehumanization, the denial of human qualities to other people. At its most extreme, dehumanization enables systemic discrimination and genocide, but it also occurs in everyday life, such as when we ignore the experience of the homeless or the agency of the beautiful. The most reliable predictor of dehumanization is antipathy—seeing someone as your enemy.

31. eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, who wrote, “Sexual love makes of the loved person an Object of appetite; as soon as that appetite has been stilled, the person is cast aside as one casts away a lemon which has been sucked dry.”25 Of course, lemon sucking and sex may seem to differ in enjoyability,* but the point is clear—people who are sexualized are seen as simply a means to achieving satisfaction and not as people themselves.

32. Another test of these hypotheses used stimuli from the portrait book XXX: 30 Porn Star Portraits by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders. This book is an experimental psychologist’s dream because it contains identically posed, identically made up, and identically lit adult film stars photographed either clothed or completely naked, enabling researchers to isolate the precise effect of nakedness. When people rated the minds of the exact same adult film star either naked or clothed, they saw the naked version as less capable of thinking but as more capable of feeling, again consistent with typecasting.

34. Autism is one disorder of mind perception; psychopathy is another. Psychopaths are the dark cousins of those with autism; whereas those with autism are confused but caring, those with psychopathy are cold and calculating. Those with psychopathy typically can understand other minds but seldom care enough to bother. They lack empathy for others, viewing people as mere tools to achieve their own goals, and will harm others without compunction—they truly belong in this chapter on the enemy. Psychologist Hervey Cleckley, who documents many cases of psychopathy in his book The Mask of Sanity,

35. Psychopaths can often recognize the thoughts and feelings of others—if only to manipulate them—but they do have trouble understanding when others are in distress. Psychologist Abby Marsh has studied this phenomenon in children with antisocial behavioral patterns, including children with conduct disorder, who are likely to grow into full-blown psychopaths.45 In a typical study she presents participants with pictures featuring actors making different posed emotional expressions, such as disgust, anger, and fear. Children with conduct disorder are usually quite good at identifying various emotional expressions, except when it comes to fear, where they seem to lack insight.46 An instructive story comes from Essi Viding, a professor at University College London who performed a similar study, asking one teenager with conduct disorder to identify the emotional state of someone who appeared distressed and afraid. The teenager said, “I don’t know what that expression is called, but I know it’s what people look like right before I stab them.” This insensitivity to the distress of others may stem from their own inability to feel this emotion. Psychopaths are notoriously calm in the face of danger, which may explain why some amount of psychopathy helps people succeed in high-pressure environments. You may not be surprised to learn that CEOs are four times more likely to qualify as psychopaths than the general population.

36. Below comas are vegetative states, which are characterized by significantly more brain damage and poorer overall functioning. In these states vegetative functions, like breathing and swallowing, remain intact, but people are unresponsive to stimuli and unable to complete voluntary behavior.17 Vegetative states are further categorized by how long they have lasted. After four weeks, patients are classified as being in a “persistent vegetative state” and have a significantly reduced chance of ever recovering. Patients in vegetative states may still look like they’re sleeping, but they’re not—and they’re not dreaming either.

37. When do cells become people? This question mirrors a long-standing philosophical problem called the sorites paradox, which asks when “grains of sand” become a “pile”?* We can all agree that one grain of sand is not a pile and that a thousand grains is a pile. We can also all agree that one grain of sand never makes the difference between a pile and not a pile. Two grains of sand still isn’t a pile and 999 grains of sand still is a pile. But here’s the paradox: If you keep adding (or taking away) single grains of sand, eventually you do end up with a pile (or a lack of pile). Somehow, “pileness” emerges from enough grains of sand, even though there is no one single grain that does the trick.

38. Gestalt is a German word that translates to “shape” or “form,” but it has long held another deeper definition in psychology. Gestalt psychology began in the early twentieth century as a reaction to psychology that examined isolated elements of human perception. Whereas a typical psychologist studied the perception of specific features like shadows or edges or lines, a Gestalt psychologist studied how it all fit together. Although Gestalt psychologists primarily studied visual perception, they revealed five principles of “groupiness” that also apply to perceptions of people: proximity, similarity, closure, continuation, and common fate.2

39. So far we have learned two things about how people perceive the minds of groups. The first is that we take mind away from individual group members and instead give it to the overall group. The second is that we frequently blame groups—and their agentic minds—for wrongdoing. Sometimes this evildoing is perpetrated by collections of überpowerful individuals, but recent movies, television, and books have popularized a very different idea of group evil. Accounts such as World War Z, The Walking Dead, and 28 Days Later have depicted groups who do incredible harm but with relatively mindless members. It paints these group members as zombies—not the philosophical kind this time but actual brain-eating monsters. Zombies illustrate our deep fears about what happens to people in groups. They lose all individual thought and self-control, shuffling mindlessly toward their goal of destruction. Even more than sheep, zombies are completely interchangeable, each of them slack-jawed and glassy-eyed in tattered clothes. If this sounds like teenagers, you’re right, and the comparison is very apt, as people seem to fear zombies similarly to how they fear groups of youths standing on the corner. Members of both groups seem to lose themselves to the will of the group and to think little for themselves. Although zombification due to experimental viruses is good science fiction, the zombification of people in groups is just good science.

40. we-feeling is induced especially through synchrony, when your actions are closely matched to those of other group members. Examples of synchrony include platoons marching in step, concert fans swaying back and forth together, and prayers being jointly said by a congregation—each of which seems to bind people together into a coherent whole.

42. Synchrony with group members is one way that groups encourage evil against outsiders, and anonymity is another. History has repeatedly shown that groups are especially destructive when members cannot be identified, whether because of masks or uniforms or even the firewalls of the Internet. This anonymity leads group members to identify more with the group and see outsiders as more bound to their rival groups.23 Cloaked in his uniform, a Nazi soldier sees himself not as an individual but instead as simply a Nazi, while also viewing his victims not as individual human beings but as members of an undesirable group to be exterminated.

43. Group think is when people fail to voice their concerns in a group meeting, and it led to the deaths of the seven astronauts on the space shuttle Challenger. On January 27, 1986, one day before the launch, the engineers met to discuss the next day’s cold-weather forecast. Individually they each doubted that the rubber O-ring in the solid rocket boosters would function in the below-freezing temperatures, but collectively it seemed that the group wasn’t worried. Each engineer erroneously believed that everybody else was confident about the O-ring and mistook the group’s silence for confidence. The O-ring went in as planned and the shuttle exploded seventy-three seconds after takeoff.

44. If you think about it, this scenario is exactly like Pascal’s wager because of a massive asymmetry in outcomes. Just as the threat of eternal suffering makes it rational to believe in God, the threat of death makes it rational to always assume that there is a lion in the grass. This cost/benefit ratio is just the kind of thing upon which natural selection operates, such that “lion assumers” generally live longer and pass on more genes than “lion ignorers.” The same principle holds whether we are taking about lions, tigers, or bears.* Evolution has selected for people who in ambiguous situations are likely to perceive agents—those self-directed minds that could eat or otherwise harm them. More specifically, evolution has endowed our prehistoric ancestors—and us—with a hyperactive agency-detection device (HADD) that makes us acutely sensitive to the possibility of agents in our environment.5 Of course, in today’s world we are seldom at risk of being eaten by predators, but the HADD still works as well as ever. When you are home alone at night and hear a strange noise from your backyard, you instantly think of a serial killer and not a gust of wind. And when you feel a soft twitching on your face, you instantly think of a spider and not a stray piece of hair. This hardwired tendency to detect earthy agents also makes us detect supernatural agents. When a branch snaps in a dark forest, it might be a bear, or it might be the ghost of a murdered camper. As we saw in the previous chapter, people often assume that these supernatural agents are dangerous. For example, Japanese Buddhism speaks of the jikininki, spirits of the evil dead who come back at night to devour human corpses,6 and the ancient Greeks spoke of the Keres, spirits who would fly over battlefields and descend upon wounded soldiers to drink their blood and send them to Hades.

45. Although threatening situations predispose people to see agents, people will also perceive them at more relaxed times, such as when lying on their backs, staring at faces in the clouds.8 Part of this perception stems from apophenia, the general tendency of our minds to make meaning out of the meaningless. At its most extreme this can be a symptom of schizophrenia, such as when people believe that individuals wearing red ties are part of a vast communist conspiracy to overthrow the government (as in the case of Nobel Prize–winning mathematician and paranoid schizophrenic John Nash).

46. A less extreme form of apophenia involves the idea of divination, in which you can see hints of the future through patterns of tea leaves, tarot cards, or runes. For example, in ancient Rome religious figures known as haruspices performed divination by examining the entrails of sacrificed sheep, particularly their livers.10 Each of these cases of apophenia typically involves supernatural agents, as people believed that spirits and gods were speaking through the cards (or sheep organs).

48. When cooperation dissolves in shared houses, no one pays the rent, no one does the dishes or takes out the trash, and life descends into filthy chaos. When cooperation dissolves in whole societies, catastrophe results, and so evolution needs mechanisms for making people cooperate.15 In small societies like individual tribes, these cooperation-inducing mechanisms include gossip, ostracism, and punishment.16 People who act selfishly in small communities are subject to penalties from simple name-calling to exile. The benefit of small groups is that everyone knows everyone else, and so it’s easy to keep tabs on other people, whether by observing them directly or through hearsay. However, the downside of these small societies is that they can’t accomplish as much as big societies. When your entire tribe consists of only ninety people, it’s hard to build hospitals, roads, and universities. Accordingly, evolution has favored bigger societies, but this has led to a cooperation problem.

51. Neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga has suggested that our conscious self is just an “interpreter” that spins plausible stories for our behavior after the fact.14 Many times these stories are right. The reason we ordered the chocolate cake instead of the fruit flan is because we love chocolate. But that’s not a special reason that only you can know. A stranger can infer the exact same reason when observing your behavior, suggesting that we may know little more about ourselves than an educated outsider. This logic turns mind perception on its head. We’ve always discussed how other minds are ultimately inaccessible and a matter of perception, but our own minds may be almost as inaccessible and perceived. What is most striking about our lack of self-insight is not necessarily that we make up explanations but our total confidence in their correctness. We seldom pause to consider that we might be mistaken about our reasons for acting—or anything else. Instead we consistently try to confirm what (we think) we already know, a tendency called the confirmation bias. More technically, the confirmation bias is the systematic distortion in the search, interpretation, and recall of information in order to support preexisting theories

54. However, self-control is one domain where psychology actually does offer some pretty good tips on how to increase agency. The general tip is to never rely on self-control. This answer may seem evasive, but it is consistent with the social-psychological concept that people are typically at the mercy of their environment, which influences them via cues they seldom detect. The best way to exert self-control is to never put yourself in situations where you have to exert it, and instead to focus on structuring your environment such that succumbing to temptation is impossible. For example, the best way to avoid eating fatty snacks at home is to never purchase them at the grocery store.

55. These gimmicks are called “commitment devices” because they force your commitment to self-control. The drug Antabuse is a commitment device for alcoholism. Normally your body breaks down alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is then quickly converted into acetic acid. A hangover is essentially the effects of acetaldehyde in your system, and Antabuse works by blocking the conversation of acetaldehyde into harmless acetic acid.

56. Beyond preemptive drugs, enforcer friends, or familial torture there is one especially powerful method to increase self-control: implementation intentions. They are surprisingly simple and effective. In the first test of their power, NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer recruited participants and assigned them to write and then mail an essay over Christmas break—a pretty onerous task for college students. Half the participants were simply reminded to make sure they wrote it, whereas the other half were asked to make a plan for when and where they were going to write it, such as “After opening gifts, I will go up to my desk, turn on my computer, and write the essay.” Gollwitzer found that the simple act of picking a time and place in advance increased the rate of essay completion from 32 percent to 71 percent.31 That’s a huge effect, especially given how minimal the intervention. More generally, implementation intentions take the form of “if/when X, then Y.” For the Christmas essay the X is “after opening gifts” and the Y “go upstairs and turn on the computer.” For weight loss the implementation intention might be “When I get hungry, I will open the fridge and take out vegetables, not cake.” For quitting smoking it might be “When I crave a cigarette, I will unwrap a piece of Nicorette and then do ten push-ups.” For quitting drinking it might be “If friends call inviting me out to the bar, I will suggest that we go to a movie.” Implementation intentions have been found to work in all these domains32 and others, including performing breast exams and reducing feelings of anxiety.33 You may believe that implementation intentions are too simplistic to work, and you wouldn’t be alone. When he first heard of the Christmas essay study, our University of North Carolina colleague Paschal Sheeran was incredulous and reran the study, expecting to find nothing. Instead he replicated the effect and became an instant convert, and he now uses implementation intentions to increase patients’ adherence to cancer-fighting regimens. In one study Sheeran increased attendance at cervical cancer screenings from 69 percent to 92 percent with simple implementation intentions.34 The reason implementation intentions work so well is because they export self-control, but this time to the unconscious self. As the Libet study revealed (and Freud long emphasized), our conscious self often plays second fiddle to our unconscious self, and implementation intentions create a simple program for your unconscious mind to control itself.

57. The state of being when the mind is fully engaged with a task has been called “flow” by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi* and is typically experienced when the demands of a task are perfectly matched by your capacities.42 If you have ever felt the minutes slip away while driving winding mountain roads or cooking elaborate meals or painting a fresh canvas, you have experienced flow. Flow is the one time that our restless minds are quiet, when the self disappears and you stop worrying about your work or your weight and focus only on the present. This kind of state sounds blissful—and it is—and so it seems the path to happiness involves making the self disappear. But this presumes that we even know how to define the “self,” that elusive quality that makes you “you.”

   - Page: 259

58. One philosopher, Derek Parfit, suggested an even better definition of the self. Parfit is a philosopher who was trained and now teaches at Oxford and lives a monastic existence. Most of Parfit’s time is spent alone in thought, and each day he dons the same outfit: a white shirt and black trousers. Interestingly, Parfit has a complete inability to create mental images, so he cannot picture his house or his wife unless they are right in front of him. It is perhaps this difficulty that makes Parfit so uniquely gifted at thinking in the abstract and that is the reason he thinks the central facet of identity is memory.44 According to Parfit, you know that you are the same person from day to day because your memories remain constant and connect to one another in an orderly chain. Even though you are far older now, you still remember your first waterslide, your first kiss, your first heartbreak, and your first car accident. Even as you accrue more memories, these earlier memories stick around, connecting your future self to your past self.

59. The centrality of memory in defining the self can make it tenuous, because any memories can potentially be forgotten. When people suffer from Alzheimer’s, they slowly lose all their memories—and therefore themselves. As journalist David Shenk once wrote, “The fear of Alzheimer’s is the fear of losing your identity while your healthy body walks on into oblivion. It is the fear of becoming a ghost.”
   - Location: 3994-3997
   - Page: 261

60. Parfit is not alone in viewing the self as an arbitrary construction rather than an enduring essence. Daniel Dennett makes an elegant analogy between the self and the center of gravity.48 Any object with mass—whether a bowl, a piece of lumber, or even a brain—has a mathematical center, a precise location that would allow you to balance that object if you were to put it on a pointed stake. However, this center of gravity is not a “thing” that exists independently of all the stuff around it, and if you took apart the object, you would never find a separate little object that is the center of gravity. The self is a lot like that—it’s just the theoretical point that lies at the center of all your mental experiences, memories, thoughts, feelings, sensations, goals, desires, and personal relationships. “You” is like a web without a spider, a collection of memories, thoughts, desires, and feelings that is fragile and tenuous and yet still glimmers in the sunshine of perception.

## Intelligence: All That Matters
**Author:** Stuart Ritchie

### Highlights (10)

1. Philosophers have discussed human faculties for centuries. One popular conception, attributed to Aristotle, was the ‘five wits’: imagination, fantasy, memory, reason and the ‘common sense’.

2. With his collaborator, Théodore Simon (1872–1961), Binet set about creating a selection of different mental tasks that he believed children of each disability level could perform. The levels were named, in order of decreasing ability, with the now-offensive titles ‘débile’ (or ‘moron’), ‘imbécile’, and ‘idiot’.
   - Location: 90-92

3. The psychologist Steven Pinker (2010) has suggested that humans have adapted to the ‘cognitive niche’: just as some animals thrive by living in the tops of trees, or by flying, or by becoming parasites on other animals, our special remit is our high level of intelligence.
   - Location: 673-675

4. the brute size of the brain is far from the full story on the evolution of intelligence. After all, the brains of elephants are much larger than ours, and whereas they’re smart compared to most other animals, nobody is predicting that they’ll be launching rockets to the moon any time in the near future. As well as the size, the complexity and organization of our brains changed across evolutionary time. Think of it like an army: having a very large number of soldiers will help you win battles, but another way to win is to have a smaller army that’s equipped with more advanced technology. The smaller army might also be more efficient, using fewer precious resources. This is an important consideration in evolution: large brains consume a lot of energy, and this downside of becoming ever larger may have outweighed the advantages.
   - Location: 686-692
   - Page: 45

5. We now enter the realm of ‘behavioural genetics’. Importantly, it comes in two flavours. The first asks ‘To what extent do genes contribute to intelligence differences?’ and is called quantitative genetics. The second asks ‘Which are the specific genes in the DNA that, when they differ among people, cause intelligence differences?’ and is called molecular genetics. This is a subtle distinction, and it often causes confusion. The point is this: we can know whether there are genetic effects on intelligence (from quantitative genetics) without knowing any of the specific genes involved (that is, without knowing the molecular genetics).

6. The frontal lobes are connected to other parts of the brain that are also essential for complex thought. In what is the best-supported theoretical model of intelligence and the brain, called the ‘P-FIT’ (for Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory), neuroscientists Rex Jung and Richard Haier (2007) suggest that intelligence is particularly dependent on a brain network that links the frontal lobes to the parietal lobes. This latter part of the brain (see Figure 4.2) is thought to collect and organize perceptual information (which is processed in yet other areas of the brain), then feed it forward to the frontal lobes, which in turn begin to reason their way through problems. Figure 4.2  Diagram of the human brain, viewed from the left, indicating the different lobes. The double-headed arrow shows the main brain circuit implicated in the P-FIT theory. (Diagram by the author, after Jung and Haier, 2007.) The P-FIT model emphasizes that the parietal and frontal areas need to send information between one another. To do that, they rely on another kind of brain tissue, the ‘white matter’. White matter cells – so-called because of the white-coloured insulation material, myelin, that surrounds their long, tendril-like axons – are grouped together in million-strong bundles known as ‘tracts’, which connect up, and transmit signals between, important areas of the cortex. See Figure 4.3 for an illustration of the brain’s white matter tracts. Figure 4.3  The brain’s white matter connections seen from the front, viewed using Diffusion Tensor MRI. These connections carry signals throughout the brain, transmitting information between important areas of the cortex. (Image courtesy of Mark Bastin, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh.) People vary in the efficiency of these connections, and neuroscientists have come up with an ingenious way of measuring this variation, called ‘Diffusion Tensor’ MRI. In this kind of MRI scan, the researchers track the diffusion of water molecules that are moving through the cells. If the molecules have a good deal of movement in one direction, along the length of the tract, the inference is made that the tract is making a good connection, and can efficiently pass on the electrochemical signals that transmit information throughout the brain. If the molecules’ movement is more random, this implies that they are often diffusing out of the sides of the tract, and thus some of the signals may be being lost, like in a pipe that has sprung a leak. Many studies have now shown that this measure of the efficiency of white matter connections is correlated with performance on IQ tests, especially those that involve reasoning and speed. Better connections tend to mean faster and more efficient cognitive abilities (Penke et al., 2012).

7. More evidence for the P-FIT model of intelligence comes from functional neuroimaging. Everything we’ve discussed so far comes from structural imaging, where the build of the brain and its connections are analysed, but researchers can also ask participants to do IQ tests while they’re in the scanner, and study their patterns of brain activity while they do so. One way of doing this is functional MRI, or fMRI. As particular brain areas become more active, they require more energy; blood flows to them to provide it, and the fMRI scan picks up on the flow. In these studies, the brain areas that ‘light up’ most commonly on the scans as the IQ tests are completed are – you guessed it – the frontal and parietal regions. Another important finding from functional imaging relates to brain efficiency. Compared to those with lower ability, the brains of higher-IQ people tend to show less, rather than more, activity when completing complicated tasks: this suggests that their brains can more efficiently work through the problems.

8. The poor evidence for the Mozart Effect hasn’t stopped the development of a huge industry that sells CDs and MP3s of Mozart (and other composers), with the express purpose of boosting IQ (just search your favourite music-purchasing website for ‘Mozart IQ’ and you’ll see dozens of examples). It’s almost as if the clocks stopped in 1993, and none of the failed replications of the Mozart Effect ever happened. Even worse, many of the Mozart-IQ CDs are aimed at parents with babies (‘Boost your child’s IQ with Mozart!’), even though the participants in the original study, and in most of the subsequent ones, were university students.

9. there is evidence that after scientists became aware of the toxic effects of lead, and governments banned it from petrol (and thus petrol fumes), children’s IQ scores improved as a result (Huang et al., 2012).

10. Many intelligence researchers shy away completely from even using the word ‘intelligence’, replacing it with more neutral, euphemistic terms like ‘cognitive function’ or ‘general mental ability’.

2. cells only arose from other cells, then growth could occur in only two ways: either by increasing cell numbers or by increasing cell size. Virchow called these two modes hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In hypertrophy, the number of cells did not change; instead, each individual cell merely grew in size—like a balloon being blown up. Hyperplasia, in contrast, was growth by virtue of cells increasing in number. Every growing human tissue could be described in terms of hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In adult animals, fat and muscle usually grow by hypertrophy. In contrast, the liver, blood, the gut, and the skin all grow through hyperplasia—cells becoming cells becoming more cells,

4. Imagine, now, that we have designed a trial to determine whether our screening test increases survival. Two identical twins, call them Hope and Prudence, live in neighboring houses and are offered the trial. Hope chooses to be screened by the test. Prudence, suspicious of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, refuses to be screened. Unbeknownst to Hope and Prudence, identical forms of cancer develop in both twins at the exact same time—in 1990. Hope’s tumor is detected by the screening test in 1995, and she undergoes surgical treatment and chemotherapy. She survives five additional years, then relapses and dies ten years after her original diagnosis, in 2000. Prudence, in contrast, detects her tumor only when she feels a growing lump in her breast in 1999. She, too, has treatment, with some marginal benefit, then relapses and dies at the same moment as Hope in 2000. At the joint funeral, as the mourners stream by the identical caskets, an argument breaks out among Hope’s and Prudence’s doctors. Hope’s physicians insist that she had a five-year survival: her tumor was detected in 1995 and she died in 2000. Prudence’s doctors insist that her survival was one year: Prudence’s tumor was detected in 1999 and she died in 2000. Yet both cannot be right: the twins died from the same tumor at the exact same time. The solution to this seeming paradox—called lead-time bias—is immediately obvious. Using survival as an end point for a screening test is flawed because early detection pushes the clock of diagnosis backward. Hope’s tumor and Prudence’s tumor possess exactly identical biological behavior. But since doctors detected Hope’s tumor earlier, it seems, falsely, that she lived longer and that the screening test was beneficial. So our test must now cross an additional hurdle: it must improve mortality, not survival. The only appropriate way to judge whether Hope’s test was truly beneficial is to ask whether Hope lived longer regardless of the time of her diagnosis. Had Hope lived until 2010 (outliving Prudence by a decade), we could have legitimately ascribed a benefit to the test. Since both women died at the exact same moment, we now discover that screening produced no benefit.

5. In 1971, eight years after the study had been launched, Strax, Venet, and Shapiro revealed the initial findings of the HIP trial. At first glance, it seemed like a resounding vindication of screening. Sixty-two thousand women had been enrolled in the trial; about half had been screened by mammography. There had been thirty-one deaths in the mammography-screened group and fifty-two deaths in the control group. The absolute number of lives saved was admittedly modest, but the fractional reduction in mortality from screening—almost 40 percent—was remarkable.

6. In 1988, at the end of its twelfth year, the Malmö study reported its results. Overall, 588 women had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the screened group, and 447 in the control group—underscoring, once again, the capacity of mammography to detect early cancers. But notably, at least at first glance, early detection had not translated into overwhelming numbers of lives saved. One hundred and twenty-nine women had died of breast cancer—sixty-three in the screened and sixty-six in the unscreened—with no statistically discernible difference overall.

7. But there was a pattern behind the deaths. When the groups were analyzed by age, women above fifty-five years had benefited from screening, with a reduction in breast cancer deaths by 20 percent. In younger women, in contrast, screening with mammography showed no detectable benefit. This pattern—a clearly discernible benefit for older women, and a barely detectable benefit in younger women—would be confirmed in scores of studies that followed Malmö. In 2002, twenty-six years after the launch of the original Malmö experiment, an exhaustive analysis combining all the Swedish studies was published in the Lancet. In all, 247,000 women had been enrolled in these trials. The pooled analysis vindicated the Malmö results. In aggregate, over the course of fifteen years, mammography had resulted in 20 to 30 percent reductions in breast cancer mortality for women aged fifty-five to seventy. But for women below fifty-five, the benefit was barely discernible.

9. By the early 1950s, cancer researchers had thus split into three feuding camps. The virologists, led by Rous, claimed that viruses caused cancer, although no such virus had been found in human studies. Epidemiologists, such as Doll and Hill, argued that exogenous chemicals caused cancer, although they could not offer a mechanistic explanation for their theory or results. The third camp, of Theodor Boveri’s successors, stood at the farthest periphery. They possessed weak, circumstantial evidence that genes internal to the cell might cause cancer, but had neither the powerful human data of the epidemiologists nor the exquisite experimental insights of the chicken virologists. Great science emerges out of great contradiction, and here was a gaping rift slicing its way through the center of cancer biology. Was human cancer caused by an infectious agent? Was it caused by an exogenous chemical? Was it caused by an internal gene? How could the three groups of scientists have examined the same elephant and returned with such radically variant opinions about its essential anatomy?

10. Rous’s sarcoma virus, then, was the product of an incredible evolutionary accident. Retroviruses, Temin had shown, shuttle constantly out of the cell’s genome: RNA to DNA to RNA. During this cycling, they can pick up pieces of the cell’s genes and carry them, like barnacles, from one cell to another. Rous’s sarcoma virus had likely picked up an activated src gene from a cancer cell and carried it in the viral genome, creating more cancer. The virus, in effect, was no more than an accidental courier for a gene that had originated in a cancer cell—a parasite parasitized by cancer. Rous had been wrong—but spectacularly wrong. Viruses did cause cancer, but they did so, typically, by tampering with genes that originate in cells.

11. hunting for the missing pieces of the infamous Philadelphia chromosome—Rowley found a pattern. The missing head of chromosome twenty-two had attached itself elsewhere—to the tip of chromosome nine. And a piece of chromosome nine had conversely attached itself to chromosome twenty-two. This genetic event was termed a translocation—the flip-flop transposition of two pieces of chromosomes.

12. Chromosomal translocations can create new genes called chimeras by fusing two genes formerly located on two different chromosomes—the “head” of chromosome nine, say, fused with the “tail” of a gene in chromosome thirteen. The CML translocation, Rowley postulated, had created such a chimera.

13. Two classes of genes are apparently critical in the origin of the cancers of children,” he wrote. “One class, that of oncogenes, acts by virtue of abnormal or elevated activity. . . . The other class, that of anti-oncogenes [or tumor suppressors], is recessive in oncogenesis; cancer results when both normal copies have been mutated or deleted. Some persons carry one such mutation in the germline and are highly susceptible to tumor because only one somatic event is necessary. Some children, even though carrying no such mutation in the germline, can acquire tumor as a result of two somatic events.”

14. The philosopher of science Karl Popper coined the term risky prediction to describe the process by which scientists verify untested theories. Good theories, Popper proposed, generate risky predictions. They presage an unanticipated fact or event that runs a real risk of not occurring or being proven incorrect. When this unanticipated fact proves true or the event does occur, the theory gains credibility and robustness. Newton’s understanding of gravitation was most spectacularly validated when it accurately presaged the return of Halley’s comet in 1758. Einstein’s theory of relativity was vindicated in 1919 by the demonstration that light from distant stars is “bent” by the mass of the sun, just as predicted by the theory’s equations.

15. In 1982, Weinberg, Barbacid, and Wigler independently published their discoveries and compared their results. It was a powerful, unexpected convergence: all three labs had isolated the same fragment of DNA, containing a gene called ras, from their respective cancer cells.† Like src, ras was also a gene present in all cells. But like src again, the ras gene in normal cells was functionally different from the ras present in cancer cells. In normal cells, the ras gene encoded a tightly regulated protein that turned “on” and “off” like a carefully modulated switch. In cancer cells, the gene was mutated, just as Varmus and Bishop had predicted. Mutated ras encoded a berserk, perpetually hyperactive protein permanently locked “on.” This mutant protein produced an unquenchable signal for a cell to divide—and to keep dividing. It was the long-sought “native” human oncogene, captured in flesh and blood out of a cancer cell.

16. In the decade between 1983 and 1993, a horde of other oncogenes and anti-oncogenes (tumor suppressor genes) were swiftly identified in human cancers: myc, neu, fos, ret, akt (all oncogenes), and p53, VHL, APC (all tumor suppressors).

18. Genes encode proteins, and proteins often work like minuscule molecular switches, activating yet other proteins and inactivating others, turning molecular switches “on” and “off” inside a cell. Thus, a conceptual diagram can be drawn for any such protein: protein A turns B on, which turns C on and D off, which turns E on, and so forth. This molecular cascade is termed the signaling pathway for a protein. Such pathways are constantly active in cells, bringing signals in and signals out, thereby allowing a cell to function in its environment. Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, cancer biologists discovered, sit at the hubs of such signaling pathways. Ras, for instance, activates a protein called Mek. Mek in turn activates Erk, which, through several intermediary steps, ultimately accelerates cell division. This cascade of steps, called the Ras-Mek-Erk pathway—is tightly regulated in normal cells, thereby ensuring tightly regulated cell division. In cancer cells, activated “Ras” chronically and permanently activates Mek, which permanently activates Erk, resulting in uncontrolled cell division—pathological mitosis. But the activated ras pathway (Ras→ Mek → Erk) does not merely cause accelerated cell division; the pathway also intersects with other pathways to enable several other “behaviors” of cancer cells. At Children’s Hospital in Boston in the 1990s, the surgeon-scientist Judah Folkman demonstrated that certain activated signaling pathways within cancer cells, ras among them, could also induce neighboring blood vessels to grow. A tumor could thus “acquire” its own blood supply by insidiously inciting a network of blood vessels around itself and then growing, in grapelike clusters, around those vessels, a phenomenon that Folkman called tumor angiogenesis.

19. Folkman’s Harvard colleague Stan Korsmeyer found other activated pathways in cancer cells, originating in mutated genes, that also blocked cell death, thus imbuing cancer cells with the capacity to resist death signals. Other pathways allowed cancer cells to acquire motility, the capacity to move from one tissue to another—initiating metastasis. Yet other gene cascades increased cell survival in hostile environments, such that cancer cells traveling through the bloodstream could invade other organs and not be rejected or destroyed in environments not designed for their survival. Cancer, in short, was not merely genetic in its origin; it was genetic in its entirety. Abnormal genes governed all aspects of cancer’s behavior. Cascades of aberrant signals, originating in mutant genes, fanned out within the cancer cell, promoting survival, accelerating growth, enabling mobility, recruiting blood vessels, enhancing nourishment, drawing oxygen—sustaining cancer’s life.

20. A final note: I said CML was a “rare” disease, and that was true in the era before Gleevec. The incidence of CML remains unchanged from the past: only a few thousand patients are diagnosed with this form of leukemia every year. But the prevalence of CML—the number of patients presently alive with the disease—has dramatically changed with the introduction of Gleevec. As of 2009, CML patients treated with Gleevec survive an average of thirty years after their diagnosis. Based on that survival figure, Hagop Kantarjian estimates that within the next decade, 250,000 people will be living with CML in America, all of them on targeted therapy. Druker’s drug will alter the national physiognomy of cancer, converting a once-rare disease into a relatively common one. (Druker jokes that he has achieved the perfect inversion of the goals of cancer medicine: his drug has increased the prevalence of cancer in the world.) Given that most of our social networks typically extend to about one thousand individuals, each of us, on average, will know one person with this leukemia who is being kept alive by a targeted anticancer drug.

23. In 2005, the Harvard epidemiologist David Hunter argued that the integration of traditional epidemiology, molecular biology, and cancer genetics will generate a resurgent form of epidemiology that is vastly more empowered in its ability to prevent cancer. “Traditional epidemiology,” Hunter reasoned, “is concerned with correlating exposures with cancer outcomes, and everything between the cause (exposure) and the outcome (a cancer) is treated as a ‘black box.’ . . . In molecular epidemiology, the epidemiologist [will] open up the ‘black box’ by examining the events intermediate between exposure and disease occurrence or progression.”

## Enlightenment Now
**Author:** Steven Pinker

### Highlights (46)

1. The ideals of the Enlightenment are products of human reason, but they always struggle with other strands of human nature: loyalty to tribe, deference to authority, magical thinking, the blaming of misfortune on evildoers.

2. A 21st-century statement of the same idea may be found in the physicist David Deutsch’s defense of enlightenment, The Beginning of Infinity. Deutsch argues that if we dare to understand, progress is possible in all fields, scientific, political, and moral: Optimism (in the sense that I have advocated) is the theory that all failures—all evils—are due to insufficient knowledge. . . . Problems are inevitable, because our knowledge will always be infinitely far from complete. Some problems are hard, but it is a mistake to confuse hard problems with problems unlikely to be solved. Problems are soluble, and each particular evil is a problem that can be solved. An optimistic civilization is open and not afraid to innovate, and is based on traditions of criticism. Its institutions keep improving, and the most important knowledge that they embody is knowledge of how to detect and eliminate errors.

3. If there’s anything the Enlightenment thinkers had in common, it was an insistence that we energetically apply the standard of reason to understanding our world, and not fall back on generators of delusion like faith, dogma, revelation, authority, charisma, mysticism, divination, visions, gut feelings, or the hermeneutic parsing of sacred texts.

7. Communities can thereby come up with rules that allow true beliefs to emerge from the rough-and-tumble of argument, such as that you have to provide reasons for your beliefs, you’re allowed to point out flaws in the beliefs of others, and you’re not allowed to forcibly shut people up who disagree with you. Add in the rule that you should allow the world to show you whether your beliefs are true or false, and we can call the rules science. With the right rules, a community of less than fully rational thinkers can cultivate rational thoughts.

13. Though intellectuals are apt to do a spit take when they read a defense of capitalism, its economic benefits are so obvious that they don’t need to be shown with numbers. They can literally be seen from space. A satellite photograph of Korea showing the capitalist South aglow in light and the Communist North a pit of darkness vividly illustrates the contrast in the wealth-generating capability between the two economic systems, holding geography, history, and culture constant. Other matched pairs with an experimental group and a control group lead to the same conclusion: West and East Germany when they were divided by the Iron Curtain; Botswana versus Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe; Chile versus Venezuela under Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro—the latter a once-wealthy, oil-rich country now suffering from widespread hunger and a critical shortage of medical care.

15. When countries get richer and better educated, they pass through what demographers call the demographic transition.11 First, death rates decline as nutrition and health improve. This does swell the population, but that is hardly something to bewail: as Johan Norberg notes, it happens not because people in poor countries start breeding like rabbits but because they stop dying like flies. In any case, the increase is temporary: birth rates peak and then decline, for at least two reasons. Parents no longer breed large broods as insurance against some of their children dying, and women, when they become better educated, marry later and delay having children.

No one owns the atmosphere, so people (and companies) have no reason to stint on emissions that allow each of them to enjoy their energy while harming everyone else, a perverse outcome that economists call a negative externality (another name for the collective costs in a public goods game, or the damage to the commons in the Tragedy of the Commons). A carbon tax, which only governments can impose, “internalizes” the public costs, forcing people to factor the harm into every carbon-emitting decision they make.

21. Prominent among the existential risks that supposedly threaten the future of humanity is a 21st-century version of the Y2K bug. This is the danger that we will be subjugated, intentionally or accidentally, by artificial intelligence (AI), a disaster sometimes called the Robopocalypse and commonly illustrated with stills from the Terminator movies. As with Y2K, some smart people take it seriously. Elon Musk, whose company makes artificially intelligent self-driving cars, called the technology “more dangerous than nukes.” Stephen Hawking, speaking through his artificially intelligent synthesizer, warned that it could “spell the end of the human race.”19 But among the smart people who aren’t losing sleep are most experts in artificial intelligence and most experts in human intelligence.20 The Robopocalypse is based on a muzzy conception of intelligence that owes more to the Great Chain of Being and a Nietzschean will to power than to a modern scientific understanding.21 In this conception, intelligence is an all-powerful, wish-granting potion that agents possess in different amounts. Humans have more of it than animals, and an artificially intelligent computer or robot of the future (“an AI,” in the new count-noun usage) will have more of it than humans. Since we humans have used our moderate endowment to domesticate or exterminate less well-endowed animals (and since technologically advanced societies have enslaved or annihilated technologically primitive ones), it follows that a supersmart AI would do the same to us. Since an AI will think millions of times faster than we do, and use its superintelligence to recursively improve its superintelligence (a scenario sometimes called “foom,” after the comic-book sound effect), from the instant it is turned on we will be powerless to stop it.22 But the scenario makes about as much sense as the worry that since jet planes have surpassed the flying ability of eagles, someday they will swoop out of the sky and seize our cattle. The first fallacy is a confusion of intelligence with motivation—of beliefs with desires, inferences with goals, thinking with wanting. Even if we did invent superhumanly intelligent robots, why would they want to enslave their masters or take over the world? Intelligence is the ability to deploy novel means to attain a goal. But the goals are extraneous to the intelligence: being smart is not the same as wanting something. It just so happens that the intelligence in one system, Homo sapiens, is a product of Darwinian natural selection, an inherently competitive process. In the brains of that species, reasoning comes bundled (to varying degrees in different specimens) with goals such as dominating rivals and amassing resources. But it’s a mistake to confuse a circuit in the limbic brain of a certain species of primate with the very nature of intelligence. An artificially intelligent system that was designed rather than evolved could just as easily think like shmoos, the blobby altruists in Al Capp’s comic strip Li’l Abner, who deploy their considerable ingenuity to barbecue themselves for the benefit of human eaters. There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must turn into ruthless conquistadors. Indeed, we know of one highly advanced form of intelligence that evolved without this defect. They’re called women. The second fallacy is to think of intelligence as a boundless continuum of potency, a miraculous elixir with the power to solve any problem, attain any goal.23 The fallacy leads to nonsensical questions like when an AI will “exceed human-level intelligence,” and to the image of an ultimate “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI) with God-like omniscience and omnipotence. Intelligence is a contraption of gadgets: software modules that acquire, or are programmed with, knowledge of how to pursue various goals in various domains.24 People are equipped to find food, win friends and influence people, charm prospective mates, bring up children, move around in the world, and pursue other human obsessions and pastimes. Computers may be programmed to take on some of these problems (like recognizing faces), not to bother with others (like charming mates), and to take on still other problems that humans can’t solve (like simulating the climate or sorting millions of accounting records). The problems are different, and the kinds of knowledge needed to solve them are different. Unlike Laplace’s demon, the mythical being that knows the location and momentum of every particle in the universe and feeds them into equations for physical laws to calculate the state of everything at any time in the future, a real-life knower has to acquire information about the messy world of objects and people by engaging with it one domain at a time. Understanding does not obey Moore’s Law: knowledge is acquired by formulating explanations and testing them against reality, not by running an algorithm faster and faster.25 Devouring the information on the Internet will not confer omniscience either: big data is still finite data, and the universe of knowledge is infinite. For these reasons, many AI researchers are annoyed by the latest round of hype (the perennial bane of AI) which has misled observers into thinking that Artificial General Intelligence is just around the corner.26 As far as I know, there are no projects to build an AGI, not just because it would be commercially dubious but because the concept is barely coherent. The 2010s have, to be sure, brought us systems that can drive cars, caption photographs, recognize speech, and beat humans at Jeopardy!, Go, and Atari computer games. But the advances have not come from a better understanding of the workings of intelligence but from the brute-force power of faster chips and bigger data, which allow the programs to be trained on millions of examples and generalize to similar new ones. Each system is an idiot savant, with little ability to leap to problems it was not set up to solve, and a brittle mastery of those it was. A photo-captioning program labels an impending plane crash “An airplane is parked on the tarmac”; a game-playing program is flummoxed by the slightest change in the scoring rules.27 Though the programs will surely get better, there are no signs of foom. Nor have any of these programs made a move toward taking over the lab or enslaving their programmers.

The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking confidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016 American election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a botnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic. Schneier explains, “A real-world comparison might be if an army invaded a country, then all got in line in front of people at the Department of Motor Vehicles so they couldn’t renew their licenses. If that’s what war looks like in the 21st century, we have little to fear.”

24. To be sure, advances in synthetic biology, such as the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, make it easier to tinker with organisms, including pathogens. But it’s difficult to re-engineer a complex evolved trait by inserting a gene or two, since the effects of any gene are intertwined with the rest of the organism’s genome. Ewald notes, “I don’t think that we are close to understanding how to insert combinations of genetic variants in any given pathogen that act in concert to generate high transmissibility and stably high virulence for humans.”61 The biotech expert Robert Carlson adds that “one of the problems with building any flu virus is that you need to keep your production system (cells or eggs) alive long enough to make a useful quantity of something that is trying to kill that production system. . . . Booting up the resulting virus is still very, very difficult. . . .

26. In the near term, the greatest menace of nuclear war comes not so much from the number of weapons in existence as from the circumstances in which they might be used. The policy of launch on warning, launch under attack, or hair-trigger alert is truly the stuff of nightmares. No early warning system can perfectly distinguish signal from noise, and a president awakened by the proverbial 3:00 A.M. phone call would have minutes to decide whether to fire his missiles before they were destroyed in their silos. In theory, he could start World War III in response to a short circuit, a flock of seagulls, or a bit of malware from that Bulgarian teenager. In reality, the warning systems are better than that, and there is no “hair trigger” that automatically launches missiles without human intervention.122 But when missiles can be launched on short notice, the risks of a false alarm or an accidental, rogue, or impetuous launch are real.

28. A very different threat to human progress is a political movement that seeks to undermine its Enlightenment foundations. The second decade of the 21st century has seen the rise of a counter-Enlightenment movement called populism, more accurately, authoritarian populism.24 Populism calls for the direct sovereignty of a country’s “people” (usually an ethnic group, sometimes a class), embodied in a strong leader who directly channels their authentic virtue and experience. Authoritarian populism can be seen as a pushback of elements of human nature—tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, zero-sum thinking—against the Enlightenment institutions that were designed to circumvent them. By focusing on the tribe rather than the individual, it has no place for the protection of minority rights or the promotion of human welfare worldwide. By failing to acknowledge that hard-won knowledge is the key to societal improvement, it denigrates “elites” and “experts” and downplays the marketplace of ideas, including freedom of speech, diversity of opinion, and the fact-checking of self-serving claims. By valorizing a strong leader, populism overlooks the limitations in human nature, and disdains the rule-governed institutions and constitutional checks that constrain the power of flawed human actors. Populism comes in left-wing and right-wing varieties, which share a folk theory of economics as zero-sum competition: between economic classes in the case of the left, between nations or ethnic groups in the case of the right. Problems are seen not as challenges that are inevitable in an indifferent universe but as the malevolent designs of insidious elites, minorities, or foreigners. As for progress, forget about it: populism looks backward to an age in which the nation was ethnically homogeneous, orthodox cultural and religious values prevailed, and economies were powered by farming and manufacturing, which produced tangible goods for local consumption and for export. Chapter 23 will probe the intellectual roots of authoritarian populism more deeply; here I will concentrate on its recent rise and possible future. In 2016 populist parties (mostly on the right) attracted 13.2 percent of the vote in the preceding European parliamentary elections (up from 5.1 percent in the 1960s) and entered the governing coalitions of eleven countries, including the leadership of Hungary and Poland.25 Even when they are not in power, populist parties can press their agendas, notably by catalyzing the 2016 Brexit referendum in which 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the European Union. And in that year Donald Trump was elected to the American presidency with an Electoral College victory, though with a minority of the popular vote (46 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 48 percent). Nothing captures the tribalistic and backward-looking spirit of populism better than Trump’s campaign slogan: Make America Great Again.

29. An article by the statistician Nate Silver began, “Sometimes statistical analysis is tricky, and sometimes a finding just jumps off the page.” That finding jumped right off the page and into the article’s headline: “Education, Not Income, Predicted Who Would Vote for Trump.”35 Why should education have mattered so much? Two uninteresting explanations are that the highly educated happen to affiliate with a liberal political tribe, and that education may be a better long-term predictor of economic security than current income. A more interesting explanation is that education exposes people in young adulthood to other races and cultures in a way that makes it harder to demonize them. Most interesting of all is the likelihood that education, when it does what it is supposed to do, instills a respect for vetted fact and reasoned argument, and so inoculates people against conspiracy theories, reasoning by anecdote, and emotional demagoguery.

30. Across the pond, the political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris spotted similar patterns in their analysis of 268 political parties in thirty-one European countries.38 Economic issues, they found, have been playing a smaller role in party manifestoes for decades, and noneconomic issues a larger role. The same was true of the distribution of voters. Support for populist parties is strongest not from manual workers but from the “petty bourgeoisie” (self-employed tradesmen and the owners of small businesses), followed by foremen and technicians. Populist voters are older, more religious, more rural, less educated, and more likely to be male and members of the ethnic majority. They embrace authoritarian values, place themselves on the right of the political spectrum, and dislike immigration and global and national governance.39 Brexit voters, too, were older, more rural, and less educated than those who voted to remain: 66 percent of high school graduates voted to leave, but only 29 percent of degree holders did.

32. Democrats.14 In a revolutionary analysis of reason in the public sphere, the legal scholar Dan Kahan has argued that certain beliefs become symbols of cultural allegiance. People affirm or deny these beliefs to express not what they know but who they are.15 We all identify with particular tribes or subcultures, each of which embraces a creed on what makes for a good life and how society should run its affairs. These creeds tend to vary along two dimensions. One contrasts a right-wing comfort with natural hierarchy with a left-wing preference for forced egalitarianism (measured by agreement with statements like “We need to dramatically reduce inequalities between the rich and the poor, whites and people of color, and men and women”). The other is a libertarian affinity to individualism versus a communitarian or authoritarian affinity to solidarity (measured by agreement with statements like “Government should put limits on the choices individuals can make so they don’t get in the way of what’s good for society”). A given belief, depending on how it is framed and who endorses it, can become a touchstone, password, motto, shibboleth, sacred value, or oath of allegiance to one of these tribes. As Kahan and his collaborators explain: The principal reason people disagree about climate change science is not that it has been communicated to them in forms they cannot understand. Rather, it is that positions on climate change convey values—communal concern versus individual self-reliance; prudent self-abnegation versus the heroic pursuit of reward; humility versus ingenuity; harmony with nature versus mastery over it—that divide them along cultural lines.
   - Location: 6763-6775
   - Page: 442

33. Kahan notes that people’s tendency to treat their beliefs as oaths of allegiance rather than disinterested appraisals is, in one sense, rational. With the exception of a tiny number of movers, shakers, and deciders, a person’s opinions on climate change or evolution are astronomically unlikely to make a difference to the world at large. But they make an enormous difference to the respect the person commands in his or her social circle. To express the wrong opinion on a politicized issue can make one an oddball at best—someone who “doesn’t get it”—and a traitor at worst. The pressure to conform becomes all the greater as people live and work with others who are like them and as academic, business, or religious cliques brand themselves with left-wing or right-wing causes. For pundits and politicians with a reputation for championing their faction, coming out on the wrong side of an issue would be career suicide. Given these payoffs, endorsing a belief that hasn’t passed muster with science and fact-checking isn’t so irrational after all—at least, not by the criterion of the immediate effects on the believer. The effects on the society and planet are another matter. The atmosphere doesn’t care what people think about it, and if it in fact warms by 4° Celsius, billions of people will suffer, no matter how many of them had been esteemed in their peer groups for holding the locally fashionable opinion on climate change along the way. Kahan concludes that we are all actors in a Tragedy of the Belief Commons: what’s rational for every individual to believe (based on esteem) can be irrational for the society as a whole to act upon (based on reality).

35. Any curriculum will be pedagogically ineffective if it consists of a lecturer yammering in front of a blackboard, or a textbook that students highlight with a yellow marker. People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through, to discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems. A second impediment to effective teaching is that pupils don’t spontaneously transfer what they learned from one concrete example to others in the same abstract category. Students in a math class who learn how to arrange a marching band into even rows using the principle of a least common multiple are stymied when asked to arrange rows of vegetables in a garden. In the same way, students in a critical thinking course who are taught to discuss the American Revolution from both the British and American perspectives will not make the leap to consider how the Germans viewed World War

38. An endorsement of scientific thinking must first of all be distinguished from any belief that members of the occupational guild called “science” are particularly wise or noble. The culture of science is based on the opposite belief. Its signature practices, including open debate, peer review, and double-blind methods, are designed to circumvent the sins to which scientists, being human, are vulnerable.

39. A respect for scientific thinking is, adamantly, not the belief that all current scientific hypotheses are true. Most new ones are not. The lifeblood of science is the cycle of conjecture and refutation: proposing a hypothesis and then seeing whether it survives attempts to falsify it.

40. Today most philosophers (at least in the analytic or Anglo-American tradition) subscribe to naturalism, the position that “reality is exhausted by nature, containing nothing ‘supernatural,’ and that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas of reality, including the ‘human spirit.’”17 Science, in the modern conception, is of a piece with philosophy and with reason itself.

41. What, then, distinguishes science from other exercises of reason? It certainly isn’t “the scientific method,” a term that is taught to schoolchildren but that never passes the lips of a scientist. Scientists use whichever methods help them understand the world: drudgelike tabulation of data, experimental derring-do, flights of theoretical fancy, elegant mathematical modeling, kludgy computer simulation, sweeping verbal narrative.18 All the methods are pressed into the service of two ideals, and it is these ideals that advocates of science want to export to the rest of intellectual life. The first is that the world is intelligible.

43. Social, political, and cognitive scientists are reexamining the connections between politics and human nature, which were avidly debated in Madison’s time but submerged during an interlude in which humans were treated as blank slates or rational actors. Humans, we now know, are moralistic actors: they are guided by intuitions about authority, tribe, and purity; are committed to sacred beliefs that express their identity; and are driven by conflicting inclinations toward revenge and reconciliation. We are starting to grasp why these impulses evolved, how they are implemented in the brain, how they differ among individuals, cultures, and subcultures, and which conditions turn them on and off.

45. Calling out the antihumanistic features of contemporary Islamic belief is in no way Islamophobic or civilization-clashing.

46. Remember your math: an anecdote is not a trend. Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn’t mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there’s no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn’t so, especially when our comrades know it too. Keep some perspective. Not every problem is a Crisis, Plague, Epidemic, or Existential Threat, and not every change is the End of This, the Death of That, or the Dawn of a Post-Something Era. Don’t confuse pessimism with profundity: problems are inevitable, but problems are solvable, and diagnosing every setback as a symptom of a sick society is a cheap grab for gravitas. Finally, drop the Nietzsche. His ideas may seem edgy, authentic, baaad, while humanism seems sappy, unhip, uncool. But what’s so funny about peace, love, and understanding?

## Brain, Mind and Consciousness in the History of Neuroscience (History, Philosophy and Theory of the Life Sciences)

### Highlights (5)

1. in the Timaeus we find a tripartite neurophysiology to parallel the tripartite sociology of the Republic: the proletariat, the warriors and the philosophers being represented in the body by a concupiscent soul beneath the diaphragm, a warrior soul in the thorax, and an intellectual soul in the head. It is only the latter soul that has the prospect of immortality, returning in a Buddhist-like cycle, through the forms of lesser animals, depending on its performance during life.

3. the coming of Romanticism marks an important shift in the way European intellectuals approached the study of nature in general and the mind and brain sciences in particular: Before the Romantic reaction, the dominant model had been that of “natural philosophy” with figures from Descartes to Newton and Hartley combining speculative theorizing with experimental research. Afterwards, there was a growing tendency for speculation and experimentation to drift apart so that, by the end of the nineteenth century, science and philosophy would be seen as two separate fields of endeavor.

4. Antonio Damasio, whose Looking for Spinoza 64 is an explicit effort to relate Spinoza’s philosophy to contemporary neuroscience. At the heart of Damasio’s argument in this book are two Spinozan ideas: the notion that the mind is the idea of the body (E2p13), and the assertion, which pervades the Third Part of the Ethics, that this mind/body unity implies the centrality of emotion in cognitive processes. For Damasio, the mind is a collection or stream of the mental images of bodily events. These events are responses to what he calls “emotionally competent stimuli,”65 and in an earlier work,66 he presented research evidence that damage to emotion processing structures in the brain impairs decision-making processes in ways that compromise an individual’s ability to survive. Absent the neurological images of bodily responses to environmental stimuli, an organism has an impaired sense of self and cannot, in Spinoza’s terms, “endeavor to persist in being”

5. The most profound impulse towards biological holism was, of course, the development of evolutionary theory, completed by Charles Darwin (1809–1882) in his Origin of Species.70 The evolutionary approach was applied specifically to neuroscience by John Hughlings Jackson, following the alternate model of evolution proposed by Herbert Spencer (1820–1903).71 The key premise of any post-Darwinian evolutionary theory is the interplay of variation and selection: with specific, isolated (and thus atomistic) mutations exercising a bottom-up causality while nature as a whole has a top-down causal effect through the process of selection.

## The Fourth Age: Smart Robots, Conscious Computers, and the Future of Humanity
**Author:** Byron Reese

### Highlights (80)

1. It begins when we realize that these experts disagree not because they know different things, but because they believe different things. For instance, those who predict we will make conscious computers haven’t come to that conclusion because they know something about consciousness that others don’t, but because they believe something very basic: that humans are fundamentally machines. If humans are machines, it stands to reason that we can eventually build a mechanical human. On the other hand, those who think that machines will never achieve consciousness often hold that view because they aren’t persuaded that humans are purely mechanical beings. So that is what this book is about: deconstructing the core beliefs that undergird the various views on robots, jobs, AI, and consciousness. My goal is to be your guide through these thorny issues, dissecting all the assumptions that form the opinions that these experts so passionately and confidently avow.

2. against the backdrop of history, our time has seen very little change. In fact, I maintain that things have only really changed three times in human history. Each time was due to technology. Not just a single technology, but groups of interrelated technologies that changed us in fundamental and permanent, even biological, ways. That’s it. Just three big changes so far.

4. fire changed us. Fire was the original multifunction technology. It provided light, and, because animals feared it, it also provided safety. Its portability meant that humans could migrate to colder climates and bring warmth with them. But far and away, its greatest benefit was that it let us cook food. Why was this particular use of fire so important? Cooking allowed us to vastly increase our caloric intake. Not only does cooking meat make it easier to chew, but, more important, it unwinds the proteins within it, allowing for better digestion. And, on top of all that, with fire, scores of inedible plants suddenly became food sources, since fire could break down all the indigestible cellulose and starch found in them. Fire enabled us, in effect, to “outsource” part of our digestive process. It is quite difficult to get the number of calories humans require today with just raw food, since so many pass through the body undigested. How did we use all the new calories we were able to consume? We used this new energy to grow our brains to unprecedented complexity. In a short period, we grew to have three times the number of neurons as gorillas or chimpanzees. Such a brain, however, is like an Italian supercar: it can go from zero to sixty in the blink of an eye, but it sure burns the gas doing so. Humans, in fact, use an incredibly lavish 20 percent of all of the calories we consume just to support our advanced brains. Few other creatures use even half that much energy to power their intellects. From a survival point of view, this was a pretty bold bet. To borrow a phrase from poker, humans went “all in” on the brain, and it paid off, for our more powerful brains led to our creation of another new technology: language. Language was the great leap that the historian Will Durant says “made us human.”

5. What is technology? Throughout this book, when I use that term, I mean the application of knowledge to an item, process, or technique. And what is technology for? Primarily for enhancing human ability. It allows us to do things we couldn’t do before, or allows us to do things we could do even better.

6. The versatility and complexity of language is amazing. English recently passed a million unique words, although most of us get by using only about twenty-five thousand. A new English word is coined approximately every hour, although that pace is slowing. Back in the day, someone like Shakespeare would make up three words before breakfast. The leading theory as to the culprit behind this recent slowdown in new words is automatic spell-checkers, which simply won’t put up with that kind of horseplay. And unless you want to send an email with lots of red scribbles under your so-called words, you had better use stuff already on the approved list.

Ancient history brings us tantalizing hints of a time when we had better memories, while I struggle to remember my ATM PIN. But our memories didn’t degrade immediately with the invention of writing, because books were still uncommon. Now that most knowledge is a Google search away, our memories may further decay.

13. The history from the beginning of computers to today is quite short, and for our purposes here can be told by mentioning just four names, which when listed together sound like a high-tech law firm: Babbage, Turing, von Neumann, and Shannon.
   - Location: 440-442
   - Page: 29

14. The story begins in 1821 in London with Charles Babbage. At the time, the Industrial Revolution was under way, and science and math moved from the university and the laboratory into the factory. In the days before calculating machines, large books of tables were published that could be used as shortcuts by those doing complex calculations. These books contained logarithms, astronomical calculations, and loads of other data sets essential for industry and science. The problem was that every number in those books was hand-calculated, and thus they contained numerous errors. One wrong number could send a ship off course, corrupt bank records, or cause the production of faulty machinery. Babbage, frustrated by the errors, remarked, “I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam.” This statement was profound, and an extremely modern one at that. Captured in it is a sense that things mechanical are more consistent and reliable than things organic. Steam-powered machines were carefully milled to exacting standards. Those machines performed tasks indefatigably, producing goods of consistently high quality. It was a stroke of genius on Babbage’s part to realize that if steam could make cogs, it could also compute logs. Thus he conceived of and tried to build a complete calculating machine. He understood the significance of the machine, stating that “as soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of science.” Unfortunately, he ran out of funds for his endeavor, a common fate for start-ups even then. However, in 2002 the Science Museum of London built the ten-thousand-pound machine Babbage proposed, and it worked flawlessly. Exit Babbage, who surmised that steam could power computing machines.

15. Enter Alan Turing. Turing’s contribution at this point in our tale came in 1936, when he first described what we now call a Turing machine. Turing conceived of a hypothetical machine that could perform complex mathematical problems. The machine is made up of a narrow strip of graph paper, which, in theory, is infinitely long. On the graph paper there is always a single active cell, and above that cell hovers a head. The head can read and write to the paper and move around a bit, based on the instructions it receives or the programs it runs. The point of the Turing machine was not “Here’s how you build a computer” but rather, “This simple imaginary device can solve an enormous range of computational problems. Almost all of them.” In fact, anything a computer can do today, you could theoretically do on a Turing machine. And Turing not only conceived of the machine but figured all this out. Consider that simple machine, that thought experiment with just a handful of parts: Everything Apollo 11 needed to do to make it to the moon and back could be programmed on a Turing Machine. Everything your smartphone can do can be programmed on a Turing machine, and everything IBM Watson can do can be programmed on a Turing machine. Who could have guessed that such a humble little device could do all that? Well, Turing could, of course. But no one else seems to have had that singular idea. Exit Turing.

16. Enter John von Neumann, whom we call the father of modern computing. In 1945, he developed the von Neumann architecture for computers. While Turing machines are purely theoretical, designed to frame the question of what computers can do, the von Neumann architecture is about how to build actual computers. He suggested an internal processor and computer memory that holds both programs and data. In addition to the computer’s memory, there might also be external storage to hold data and information not currently needed. Throw in input and output devices, and one has a von Neumann setup. If, when you were reading that, your brain mapped it to your computer’s CPU, memory, hard drive, keyboard, and monitor, then move to the head of the class.

17. Finally, in 1949, Claude Shannon wrote a paper entitled “Programming a Computer for Playing Chess” in which he described a way to reduce chess to a series of calculations that could be performed on a computer. While this may not sound like it should earn Shannon one of the four spots on the Mount Rushmore of computer history, for the first time, in a practical and realistic way, computers were thought of as not just machines to perform mathematical calculations. Shannon allowed that they could manipulate information at an abstract level, as necessary to make chess moves. Think about that: Before 1949, computers were programmable calculators, the kind you need in physics class. After 1949, it was conceivable that a computer might someday suggest which stocks you should buy. While many others, Turing included, intellectually knew what computers were capable of, Shannon delivered the goods.

18. So that’s that: Babbage realized machines could do math. Turing added that they could also run programs. Von Neumann figured out how to build the hardware, and Shannon showed how the software could do things that didn’t at first look like math problems.

19. Just how deeply have we embedded computers into the fabric of our lives? No one knows how many billions of computers are in operation around the world. It is believed that computers use roughly 10 percent of all of the electricity produced. They are so much a part of our lives that we literally may not be able to live without them, certainly not at our present standard of living.

21. AI began as a real science around 1955. John McCarthy, a math professor at Dartmouth, decided to organize a project to explore the possibilities and limits of “artificial intelligence,” a term he had coined the previous year. The goal was to “find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve [the] kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.” To do this, he put together a group of four computer scientists who were already thinking about machines that could think: himself, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, whom we met earlier when we discussed the first chess-playing computer program.
   - Location: 786-791
   - Page: 52

22. Their proposal then added a very, shall we say, “optimistic” prediction, especially given that it was 1955: “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.” McCarthy later regretted using the term “artificial intelligence” to describe this concept, feeling that it set the bar too high. He wished he had called it “computational intelligence” instead.

23. But as the saying goes, “You have to dance with the date who brought you.” Artificial intelligence is the term that got us here, and given that Chinese checkers is neither from China nor checkers, Arabic numbers were created in India, and koala bears aren’t bears, using the term artificial intelligence is probably okay.

24. The broadest definition is that AI is technology that reacts to data or its environment, which means that a sprinkler system with a rain sensor is a kind of AI. A more strenuous definition is that it is a technology that learns from its environment. In this sense, a thermostat that learns the temperature at which you like your rooms is an AI, but the sprinkler system isn’t.

25. So how does AI work? Very broadly speaking, there are three different approaches to how to build AI. Let’s say you want to make an AI that tells farmers when to plant their seeds. The first approach would be classic AI. We call this classic AI because in the earliest days of AI research, this is the approach that computer scientists thought would work the best. Classic AI is involves thinking through all the factors (soil type, crop, rainfall, etc.) and building a model that takes those factors, weighs them accordingly, and makes a suggestion. The second approach is called an expert system. An expert system is developed by taking a hundred of the best farmers and getting them to write down every rule about planting they know. You then arrange those rules in a way that someone can enter their relevant variables and the system will make a suggestion based on those rules. The third approach is machine learning. Machine learning refers to a process by which you take all the data concerning when everyone planted and what the yields were and you get a computer to build rules that, in retrospect, would have maximized those yields.

27. By the time the twentieth century rolled around, robots were completely creations of science. The word itself is derived from a Slavic word for slavery, and it was coined by the Czech author Karel Čapek in 1920 for his play R.U.R., the title of which stands for “Rossum’s Universal Robots.” In the play, the character Harry Domin, who invented the robots, makes a prediction which sounds identical to those made by the techno-optimists of our time, a century later: In ten years Rossum’s Universal Robots will produce so much corn, so much cloth, so much everything, that things will be practically without price. There will be no poverty. All work will be done by living machines. Everybody will be free from worry and liberated from the degradation of labor. Everybody will live only to perfect himself. The robots in that play were manufactured using biomechanics, and they were designed to do whatever drudgery humans didn’t want to. Their souls were not crushed by this work, because they were made without souls or feelings or passions of any kind. Eventually the humans stop doing any work and the robots do everything until they finally decide to take over and kill all the humans.

28. Our desire for robots has long been to build them to do the three D kinds of jobs. These are jobs that are dirty, dangerous, and dull. You could add another four Ds: disliked, demeaning, draining, and detestable. We want to give all these jobs to robots, who don’t mind doing them.

31. When you see your young neighbors, a husband and his very pregnant wife, hurry toward the car, with her holding her belly and him carrying an overnight bag and looking worried, you don’t have any trouble figuring out what is going on. That’s hard for a computer. But take it one step further. Say you didn’t see them rush off, and it is now two days later. When you notice two newspapers in their yard and their car missing, you instantly have a good idea what happened. And you don’t even have to think about it very hard, you just casually remark to your spouse, “Honey, I think the neighbors are having their baby.”

32. And yet, even with all these limitations, our primitive AI already benefits our lives in a thousand ways. AI routes you through traffic, filters out spam, predicts the weather, suggests products for you to buy, and identifies credit card fraud. Smart cameras use it to identify faces, sports teams use it to improve their strategies, HR departments use it to select job candidates. AI reads handwriting, turns speech into text, and translates both of those into other languages.

33. However, the real story is the second-order effects that these events cause. For instance, I often hear Google Translate touted as a prime example of a technology putting people out of work. It used to be, the reasoning goes, you needed a person to translate a document. Now you don’t. Case closed. However, that isn’t the whole story, is it? What really happens is that this powerful technology enables cross-language business transactions to occur more seamlessly. More translators are needed because there are many more contracts and other documents that need the additional precision of a human translator. Additionally, the human translators will expand what they do, such as helping businesses understand cultural differences with the people they are dealing with. All of this is work that would simply not have existed without Google Translate.

34. The assumptions that low-skilled workers will be the first to go and that there won’t be enough jobs for them undoubtedly have some truth to them, but they require some qualification. Generally speaking, when scoring jobs for how likely they are to be replaced by automation, the lower the wage a job pays, the higher the chance it will be automated. The inference usually drawn from this phenomenon is that a low-wage job is a low-skill job. This is not always the case. From a robot’s point of view, which of these jobs requires more skill: a waiter or a highly trained radiologist who interprets CT scans? A waiter, hands down. It requires hundreds of skills, from spotting rancid meat to cleaning up baby vomit. But because we take all those things for granted, we don’t think they are all that hard.

35. This phenomenon is so well documented that it has a name, the Moravec paradox. Hans Moravec was among those who noted that it is easier to do hard, brainy things with computers than “easy” things. It is easier to get a computer to beat a grandmaster at chess than it is to get one to tell the difference between a photo of a dog and one of a cat. Waiters’ jobs pay less than radiologists’ jobs not because they require fewer skills, but because the skills needed to be a waiter are widely available, whereas comparatively few people have the uncommon ability to interpret CT scans. What this means is that the effects of automation are not going to be overwhelmingly borne by low-wage earners. Order takers at fast-food places may be replaced by machines, but the people who clean up the restaurant at night won’t be. The jobs that automation affects

36. Often, the analysis you hear goes along these lines: “The new jobs are too complex for less-skilled workers. For instance, if a new robot replaces a warehouse worker, tomorrow the world will need one less warehouse worker. Even if the world also happened to need an additional geneticist, what are you doing to do? Will the warehouse worker have the time, money, and aptitude to train for the geneticist’s job?” No. The warehouse worker doesn’t become the geneticist. What actually happens is this: A college biology professor becomes the new geneticist; a high-school biology teacher takes the college job; a substitute elementary teacher takes the high school job; and the unemployed warehouse worker becomes a substitute teacher. This is story of progress. When a new job is created at the top, everyone gets a promotion.

37. When ATMs came out, most people assumed they would eliminate the need for bank tellers. Everyone knew what the letters ATM stood for, after all. But what really happened? Well, of course, you would always need some tellers to deal with customers wanting more than to make a deposit or get cash. So instead of a branch having four tellers and no machines, they could have two tellers and two ATMs. Then, seeing that branches were now cheaper to operate, banks realized they could open more of them as a competitive advantage, and guess what? They needed to hire more tellers. That’s why there are more human bank tellers employed today than any other time in history. But there are now also ATM manufacturing jobs, ATM repair jobs, and ATM refilling jobs. Who would have thought that when you made a robot bank teller, you would need more human ones?

38. Caenorhabditis elegans, was the first multicellular organism to have its genome sequenced. So we know a lot about it. In fact, thousands of scientists have been preoccupied with this particular nematode for decades. Studying it seems like it should be straightforward. After all, Caenorhabditis elegans have just 959 cells and their brains consist of just 302 neurons. Each of their neurons is connected to about 30 other ones, making roughly 10,000 synapses. So think about that. Your brain has as many neurons as there are stars in the Milky Way. A nematode’s brain has about as many neurons as there are pieces of cereal in a bowl of Cheerios. So one might reasonably assume that we can model a nematode brain or that we can understand how a nematode does what it does. Not even close. Somehow, via mechanisms we are far away from understanding, nematodes do some pretty complex things. They can move toward or away from heat, seek out food, find a mate, react to being touched, and generally act in ways that make them the most successful animals alive.

39. “What are humans for?” is concisely framed by Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired: We’ll spend the next decade—indeed, perhaps the next century—in a permanent identity crisis, constantly asking ourselves what humans are for. . . . The greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that AIs will help define humanity. We need AIs to tell us who we are. For the last several thousand years, humans have maintained our preeminent place on this planet for only one reason: we’re the smartest thing around. We aren’t the biggest, fastest, strongest, longest-lived, or just about any other “-est.” But we are the smartest, and we have used those smarts to become the undisputed masters and rulers of the planet. What’s going to happen if we become the second-smartest thing on the planet? And not just second, but second by an embarrassingly large margin? If the machines can think better and the robots can manipulate the physical world better, what is our job? I suspect we will fall back on consciousness. We experience the world, while machines can only measure it. We enjoy the world. Combine that with mortality and the preciousness of life, and you get something that is meaningfully human. This idea was captured in the Zen story of the tigers and the strawberry. In that story, a man is chased by a tiger, and to save himself, he jumps over a cliff, grabs a vine, and hangs there. Above him, the tiger waits. Below him circles another tiger. At the same time, a mouse comes out and starts chewing on the vine he is holding on to. But at that exact moment, the man spies a strawberry plant growing on the side of the mountain. He picks the strawberry and eats it, and never had anything tasted so good to him in all of his life. That moment, that combination of consciousness and mortality, might be what we use to define us. We are the tasters of the strawberry, able to appreciate it because we hang at the moment between life and death.

40. Is AGI possible? Overwhelmingly, the people working in this field would respond with a resounding “Of course” with an implied, “Duh!” at the end. They would probably even think the question itself a bit ridiculous. But I consider the question far from settled. We’ve never built one. We’ve never built anything close to one. No one has demonstrated that he or she knows how to do it. Estimates for when we will create an AGI range from five to five hundred years, suggesting that a bunch of people aren’t on the same page about what it will take to bring it about. In addition, we don’t understand how the brain works. Or how the mind works. Or how consciousness works, which may be required for an AGI as well.

42. We casually use language about computers as if they are creatures like us. We say things like, “When the computer sees someone repeatedly type in the wrong password, it understands what this means and interprets it as an attempted security breach.” But the computer does not actually “see” anything. Even with a camera mounted on top, it does not see. It may detect something, just like a lawn system uses a sensor to detect when the lawn is dry. Further, it does not understand anything. It may compute something, but it has no understanding.

43. Joseph Weizenbaum, an early thinker about AI, built a simple computer program in 1966, ELIZA, which was a natural language program that roughly mirrored what a psychologist might say. You make a statement like “I am sad” and ELIZA would ask, “What do you think made you sad?” Then you might say, “I am sad because no one seems to like me.” ELIZA might respond “Why do you think that no one seems to like you?” And so on. This approach will be familiar to anyone who has spent much time with a four-year-old who continually and recursively asks why, why, why to every statement. When Weizenbaum saw that people were actually pouring out their hearts to ELIZA, even though they knew it was a computer program, he turned against it. He said that in effect, when the computer says “I understand,” it tells a lie. There is no “I” and there is no understanding.

44. The entire question of AGI hinges on this point of understanding something. To get at the heart of this argument, consider the thought experiment offered up in 1980 by the American philosopher John Searle. It is called the Chinese room argument. Here it is in broad form: There is a giant room, sealed off, with one person in it. Let’s call him the Librarian. The Librarian doesn’t know any Chinese. However, the room is filled with thousands of books that allow him to look up any question in Chinese and produce an answer in Chinese. Someone outside the room, a Chinese speaker, writes a question in Chinese and slides it under the door. The Librarian picks up the piece of paper and retrieves a volume we will call book 1. He finds the first symbol in book 1, and written next to that symbol is the instruction “Look up the next symbol in book 1138.” He looks up the next symbol in book 1138. Next to that symbol he is given the instruction to retrieve book 24,601, and look up the next symbol. This goes on and on. When he finally makes it to a final symbol on the piece of paper, the final book directs him to copy a series of symbols down. He copies the cryptic symbols and passes them under the door. The Chinese speaker outside picks up the paper and reads the answer to his question. He finds the answer to be clever, witty, profound, and insightful. In fact, it is positively brilliant. Again, the Librarian does not speak any Chinese. He has no idea what the question was or what the answer said. He simply went from book to book as the books directed and copied what they directed him to copy. Now, here is the question: Does the Librarian understand Chinese? Searle uses this analogy to show that no matter how complex a computer program is, it is doing nothing more than going from book to book. There is no understanding of any kind. And it is quite hard to imagine how there can be true intelligence without any understanding whatsoever. He states plainly, “In the literal sense, the programmed computer understands what the car and the adding machine understand, namely, exactly nothing.”

45. So that is the basic argument against the possibility of AGI. First, computers simply manipulate ones and zeros in memory. No matter how fast you do that, that doesn’t somehow conjure up intelligence. Second, the computer just follows a program that was written for it, just as in the case of the Chinese room. So no matter how impressive it looks, it doesn’t really understand anything. It is just a party trick.

46. They would also be quick to offer rebuttals of the Chinese room argument. There are several, but the one most pertinent to our purposes is what I call the “quacks like a duck” argument. If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I am going to assume it is a duck. It doesn’t really matter if in your opinion there is no understanding, for if you can ask it questions in Chinese and it responds with good answers in Chinese, then it understands Chinese. If the room can act like it understands, then it understands. End of story. This was in fact Turing’s central thesis in his 1950 paper on the question of whether computers can think. He states, “May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a human does?” Turing would have seen no problem at all in saying the Chinese room can think. Of course it can. It is obvious. The idea that it can answer questions in Chinese but doesn’t understand Chinese is self-contradictory.

47. the source of human creativity? The answer is not obvious. Consider how Rodney Brooks, the renowned Australian roboticist, views a similar question. He thinks there is something in biology about living systems that we simply don’t understand. Something really big. He termed this missing something “the juice” and described it by talking about the difference between a robot trapped in a box who methodically goes through a series of steps to escape, versus an animal that very desperately wants to free itself. Robots, in his view, lack passion for anything, and that passion (the juice) is vitally important and meaningful. (Brooks, by the way, is convinced it is purely mechanistic and categorically rejects the notion of “the juice” as some attribute beyond normal physics.)

He believes that the fate of one species on one planet is of no real concern compared with the fate of the universe and says, “Humans should not stand in the way of a higher form of evolution. These machines are godlike. It is human destiny to create them.”

52. Turing, whom we discussed in chapter 4, was an early computer pioneer. A genius by any definition of the word, he was instrumental in cracking the Nazis’ Enigma code, which is said to have shortened World War II in Europe by four years. Regarded today as the father of AI, Turing, in a 1950 paper, posed the question of “can machines think?” and suggested a thinking test we now call the Turing test. There are varying versions of it, but here are the basics: You are in a room alone. There are two computer terminals. You can type questions on them. On one, the questions will be answered by a computer. On the other one, by a person. You have five minutes. Try to figure out which is which. If a machine can trick you into picking it 30 percent of the time, Turing argued that you must say that the machine is thinking, because it is able to duplicate the capabilities of a person who is thinking. It doesn’t matter, in Turing’s view, that the machine is doing its thinking differently than a human does. He predicted machines would accomplish this by the year 2000. The

Moral judgments are also affected by rights (such as privacy), roles (such as in families), past actions (such as promises), motives and intentions, and other morally relevant features.

He wrote a landmark 1976 book called Computer Power and Human Reason in which he maintains that any job that requires true empathy, such as eldercare aide, soldier, or even customer service representative, should never be done by a computer.

55. Weizenbaum makes a distinction between deciding and choosing, and suggests that computers should do only the former. Deciding is computational, like deciding which is the shortest route to work. Yet he believes that machines should never choose. A human might choose to run his car into a tree to avoid a child, but that is a human prerogative, and Weizenbaum felt deeply that delegating this to machines in no way ennobled the machine but rather debased the human. Weizenbaum felt that our temptation to delegate core parts of humanity to computers indicated “atrophy of the human spirit that comes from thinking of ourselves as computers,” a phrase that harkens back to our foundational question about what exactly we are.

57. Although it doesn’t mean “intelligence,” sentience is still an important concept to us. We care if animals, for instance, are sentient. Can they feel pain? If they can, then we are mindful of that in the ways we treat them. The bacteria I wipe out with antibiotics aren’t sentient. The mosquito I swat isn’t either. But dogs feels pain, as do cows and apes. Thus we have laws against animal cruelty, but we don’t apply them to jellyfish and tapeworms. There is no broad agreement as to where sentience begins in the animal kingdom, but we do know with some confidence about the extreme ends. Can computers be sentient? Can a machine theoretically ever feel something such as pain? The answer matters a great deal to the question of computer consciousness. Nothing can be conscious that cannot have experiences, so sentience is by necessity a prerequisite for consciousness.

This topic still matters in a practical sense because it speaks to medical and product testing on animals, and to the use of animals in scientific research. It should also be worth noting that until the latter part of the twentieth century, the consensus medical opinion was that babies didn’t feel pain either and were therefore operated on without anesthesia.

61. What is consciousness? It is often said that no one knows what consciousness is. This is not true. There is broad agreement on what it is. The mystery is how it comes about. So what is it? It is that feeling of subjective experience, of all your first-person sensations. You can feel the warmth of a fire burning in a fireplace, but a thermometer can only measure temperature. The difference between those two things is consciousness. It is, simply put, the experience of being “you.” It is the thing that makes life worth living, because without it, you are just an emotionless zombie going through life, feeling no love, experiencing no joy. Consciousness really is the single most important aspect of our existence.

63. Imagine, for a moment, that aliens kidnapped you and, so no one would notice, replaced you with a robot that looked exactly like you. Further, imagine this robot was programmed to go through the day doing all the things that you would have done. But this robot is just a glorified toaster. It doesn’t think anything. It doesn’t know what it is like to feel anything. It doesn’t know the feeling of loving your spouse or getting annoyed by traffic or wistfully daydreaming. It doesn’t know the sensation of recalling a funny joke and chuckling. It doesn’t know the experience of contemplating death or wondering what comes after it. It has no idea what ambition feels like. It can never enjoy the refreshing coolness of a glass of cold lemonade on a hot day. It doesn’t know what it is like to hear a song and like it. It doesn’t ever experience the pleasure of the smell of freshly baked bread or laundry just pulled from the dryer. It doesn’t know what heartache feels like. It knows neither the feeling one gets at the height of ecstasy nor at the depths of regret. It doesn’t know what it is like to feel brave or cowardly. This robot is just a bunch of wires and motors designed to act like you. To emulate you. So the difference between that robot and the real you is consciousness. But here’s the thing: the robot might be able to pull it off. If it smiles when you would smile and writes the memo you would have written, who would know? Yet for some unknown reason, we aren’t robots, but something wonderfully more. Consciousness is different from sentience. A simple life-form might exhibit all the indications of being in pain when injured but have no running mental conversation going on in its brain along the lines of “What in the world did I do to deserve this?” Sentience is sometimes thought of as the lowest order of consciousness, for in a sentient creature, there is at least an “I” experiencing something. Those who identify themselves as machines or animals in our foundational questions will more likely see consciousness along a continuum, in which we simply have more, potentially much more, of it than animals. Those who believe humans are different in a fundamental way from animals will likely see human consciousness as the “something different.” Consciousness is also different from intelligence. Intelligence is about reasoning; consciousness is that feeling of experiencing.

64. Another theory suggests that consciousness came about because of our competitive nature as a species. Competing with someone is easier if you can get inside his head and know what he might be thinking. So that whole process of “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes” developed into consciousness. Others suggest the exact opposite is the case, that consciousness came about because we cooperate with each other. To work in unison the way we do requires more than just language. It involves an understanding of the larger goal and your part in it. After all, consciousness enables us to signal each other better. “If I point at that mammoth, Og will look over there and see it charging him.” It is worth noting that dogs seem to be the only animal that will look in a direction a human points, suggesting that in the process of domestication we selected for this unusual trait, probably unintentionally. The philosopher Daniel C. Dennett suggests consciousness might have come about due to the tension between competition and cooperation. Deciding whether to cooperate or compete with someone might be the seed of consciousness. He says, “You can’t have language without the possibility of using it to fool people. But also you can’t have language without the capacity for cooperation. When you put the two together, consciousness is right there waiting in the wings.”

65. Julian Jaynes wrote a fascinating book in 1976 called The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Jaynes believed that as recently as three thousand years ago, humans weren’t conscious. Instead of being an integrated whole, the two halves of our brain each behaved somewhat independently. One was the commanding half, which would tell the other half what to do. This phenomenon was experienced by the person as a commanding voice. We were all, in effect, schizophrenics. Just as some schizophrenics experience “command hallucinations,” our entire existence was governed by commands we received from our right brain, which was reasoning based on our experiences. Such a brain, according to Jaynes, would not have subjective consciousness, nor would it have the ability to introspect. In support of his theory, he cites ancient literature such as The Iliad in which the characters seem to have an absence of introspection. He also uses this theory to explain why people of this era felt they were in direct and audible communion with the gods. They would have experienced the commands of their right brain as commands from the deities. That is why ancient literature is chock-full of people yakking away with the divinities. As the bicameral mind broke down, consciousness emerged, as did the rise of prayer and divination, which Jaynes understands as humanity’s response to the voices of the gods vanishing. Greeks in the time of Socrates, who were fully conscious, recognized there was a time just a few centuries earlier when the gods regularly communed with men, but that time had ended, and the gods could be accessed only through oracles from that point on. True or not, it is an interesting theory, and one that Richard Dawkins described as “either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between.” It is also, interestingly (spoiler alert), the premise behind the HBO show Westworld.

There is a pretty compelling argument, for instance, that we didn’t see color until recently. This theory was born in the nineteenth century when the British politician and classical scholar William Gladstone noted that there isn’t much color mentioned in Homer’s work, and concluded that the Greeks saw only light and dark and perhaps some red. Their experience would be something like how at dusk we lose our ability to distinguish color. Everything became different shades of gray, perhaps with a hint of color. Gladstone noted that black and white are used hundreds of times by Homer, so there was no aversion to describing things by their hue. However, red and a single word for both yellow and green were used about a dozen times each. Blue is completely absent. And it wasn’t as if there were a dearth of blue things to describe. The sea for instance, is called “wine-dark,” the same description Homer gave to sheep. I don’t know what part of the world you happen to hail from, but wine, the sea, and sheep don’t share a single hue where I live. Even the sky, which is as blue as blue can be, especially in the Mediterranean area where Homer lived, is described as bronze. Someone not seeing color might perceive the shining sky as similar to shining bronze armor. A more formal theory about the order in which we acquired color was offered by the naturalist Lazarus Geiger, who expanded the search beyond Homer to other Greek writers. He suggested that we started seeing colors relatively recently and that the order in which we saw them was from longest wavelength to shortest, or in other words, in the order they appear in the rainbow: red, orange, and so forth. All the way through Roy G. Biv. Blue and green came late, and even today a majority of languages don’t distinguish between blue and green. Geiger pointed out that “Democritus and the Pythagoreans assumed four fundamental colours, black, white, red, and yellow. . . . Ancient writers (Cicero, Pliny, and Quintilian) state it as a positive fact that the Greek painters, down to the time of Alexander, employed only these four colours.” He then adds that the Chinese, since antiquity, also saw these four colors, plus green. A survey of ancient Hindu scripture, the Old and New Testaments, the Koran, Icelandic sagas, and other ancient works shows a similar pattern, and they all lack mention of blue, even in those works that feature long descriptive passages about the sky. I go into all of this because it suggests that our brains are still changing, and we can’t rule out that the possibility that we haven’t always been conscious or the possibility that we might develop new “special abilities” down the road.

67. Weak emergence is an outcome that’s unexpected but explainable (at least in theory). It says everything is the product of a cause-and-effect outcome that can be explained as the predictable outcomes of the four fundamental forces acting on quarks and leptons, the basic building blocks of matter.

68. If consciousness is a weak emergent property, could a machine achieve it? Yes. However, we don’t have a computer that can successfully emulate the complexity of the human brain. We don’t even have one that can successfully emulate the complexity of the nematode brain. Assuming we can build a machine and achieve consciousness through weak emergence might be nothing more than a cargo cult mentality. Consciousness may be emergent, but that doesn’t tell us very much, since emergence is a black box as well.

69. In 2014, a team in Japan used one of the most powerful computers in the world to model 1 percent of human brain activity for one second. To do this, the experimenters made over 1.7 billion virtual nerve cells and over 10 trillion synapses, each of which could store 24 bytes of data. Try to imagine that. Just 1 percent of the brain for one second has an unfathomable amount of complexity. Just to do that took the computer forty minutes. And this isn’t just a souped-up laptop. It is a computer with over 700,000 processor cores and 1.4 million gigabytes of memory.

70. Others suggest that the human mind and biological life are strong emergent phenomena. So what exactly is it? If you observe a weak emergent phenomenon, you can, through study and thought, figure out what’s going on. However, strong emergence says that the emergent property is completely inexplicable as simply the interaction of the parts. There is a break in physics, or something is missing. There is no way to explain the whole as simply being the sum of the parts.

71. Consider the phenomenon of entanglement, in which two particles are so linked with each other that even if they are separated by the width of the universe, if you perform an action on one of them, its pair reacts instantly, faster than light itself. Even Einstein categorized this phenomenon as “spooky.” When compared with things like quantum entanglement,

72. The noted mathematician Roger Penrose of Oxford is one of the relatively few people who study such things who believe categorically that machines cannot become conscious. Penrose’s logic is as follows: There are mathematical functions that can be shown to not be solvable with any algorithm, and yet humans can nonetheless solve these problems. Computers, in contrast, work solely off algorithms. Therefore computers are unable to solve these problems, and thus must be fundamentally different than our minds. Penrose states: Human intuition and insight cannot be reduced to any set of rules. . . . Gödel’s theorem indeed shows this, and provides the foundation of my argument that there must be more to human thinking than can ever be achieved by a computer. Penrose believes that consciousness is created by quantum effects in neurons.

74. The hierarchy of science is that physics explains chemistry, which explains biology, which explains life. Any phenomenon you want to look at in the natural world follows this order, and complex things are explained as the interaction of simpler things. But what explains physics? Physics is built on top of fundamentals. They are the foundational building blocks of reality. They are not reducible to other causes. Gravity, for instance, is one of the four known fundamental forces. Space and mass are also considered to be fundamental to physics. What is time made of? Or space? These questions are probably answerable with things even more fundamental, but for now, we are willing to package them into things that cannot (and maybe never will) be explained.

75. The view that everything is imbued with some amount of consciousness is an ancient belief. That view of the world, quite Yoda-esqe, used to be called panpsychism but one of its modern incarnations goes by the name of integrated information theory (IIT). Koch describes the theory: The entire cosmos is suffused with sentience. We are surrounded and immersed in consciousness; it is in the air we breathe, the soil we tread on, the bacteria that colonize our intestines, and the brain that enables us to think. Although it sounds a little New Agey, several of its staunchest advocates, as well as its creator, are neuroscientists. They are joined in their view of consciousness by such figures as Plato and Spinoza, neither of whom were ever observed burning incense while chanting mantras. IIT posits that a thing is conscious to the degree that it integrates information. For instance, let’s say you are currently reading a book. As you do so, you see the letters and the words they form. But you also are aware of the temperature, the aromas coming from the kitchen, the sound of a bird singing outside. And you are integrating all that information together into an experience. And the more that you integrate, the more conscious you are. My office desk, on the other hand, is piled high with papers and books and office supplies. There is a great deal of information there, but my desk doesn’t integrate it in any meaningful way. IIT has a mechanism for quantifying consciousness with a value called phi. Everything with any emergent characteristics has some value of phi. Even a lowly proton has some consciousness. Koch explains: Even simple matter has a modicum of [integrated information]. Protons and neutrons consist of a triad of quarks that are never observed in isolation. They constitute an infinitesimal integrated system.

76. John Searle, the creator of the Chinese room thought experiment we explored earlier, has this criticism: For people who accept panpsychism, who attribute consciousness, as Koch does, to the iPhone, the question is: Why the iPhone? Why not each part of it? Each microprocessor? Why not each molecule? Why not the whole communication system of which the iPhone is a part? In other words, you are conscious. If your fingernail was conscious, then there would be two of you. But your hand would be conscious as well, making there three of you, and so forth.

77. Will and Ariel Durant dedicated over half a century of their married life together to writing their eleven-volume magnum opus, The Story of Civilization, which opens with a definition that I have never seen bettered: Civilization is social order promoting cultural creation. Four elements constitute it: economic provision, political organization, moral traditions, and the pursuit of knowledge and the arts. It begins where chaos and insecurity end. For when fear is overcome, curiosity and constructiveness are free, and man passes by natural impulse towards the understanding and embellishment of life.

78. And yet there are still about 800 million hungry people in the world, many of whom are children. In fact, 50 percent of childhood deaths under the age of five are attributable to hunger or malnutrition. We can feed a hungry person in the developing world for about a quarter a day, meaning we could feed every hungry person on the planet for around $70 billion a year, the same amount spent globally on pet food.

79. With nearly a billion hungry people in the world, there is obviously no single cause. However, far and away the biggest cause is poverty. Seventy-nine percent of the world’s hungry live in nations that are net exporters of food. How can this be? The reason people are hungry in those countries is that the products produced there can be sold on the world market for more than the local citizens can afford to pay for them. In the modern age you do not starve because you have no food, you starve because you have no money. So the problem really is that food is, in the grand scheme of things, too expensive and many people are too poor to buy it. The answer will be in continuing the trend of lowering the cost of food.

## Back to Normal: Why Ordinary Childhood Behavior Is Mistaken for ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder
**Author:** Enrico Gnaulati Phd

### Highlights (22)

1. Moreover, the average length of a visit with a pediatrician is sixteen minutes.4 This small allotment of time surely precludes much, if any, deeper discussion of a child’s worrisome behavior to make sure that any diagnosis arrived at actually applies. These days the typical child psychiatrist is not trained to observe, listen to, and think deeply about a kid’s behavior. In the 1960s and ’70s, learning how to do psychotherapy was a core requirement for psychiatrists. Current numbers out of Columbia University suggest that only one in ten psychiatrists provide psychotherapy to all of their clients.5 A 2005 report that looked at the attitudes toward psychotherapy training of psychiatry residents in seventy programs across the country produced an unflattering statistic.6 Forty-three percent of those surveyed believed that learning how to do psychotherapy in medical school was somewhat of a burden. The majority of chief residents in this same survey indicated that trainees saw an average of one to four clients, taking up six hours of their time a week—hardly intensive training by any standard. Daniel Carlat, MD, whose book Unhinged: The Trouble with Psychiatry—A Doctor’s Revelations about a Profession in Crisis brought him national acclaim when it was released in 2010, summarizes the situation: “As psychiatrists have become enthralled with diagnosis and medication, we have given up the essence of our profession—understanding the mind. We have become obsessed with psychopharmacology and its endless process of tinkering with medications, adjusting dosages, and piling on more medications to treat the side effects of the drugs we started with.”7

2. This is exactly what Irving Kirsch did and reported on in his compelling book, The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth. Dr. Kirsch and his staff accessed the FDA data available on a host of popular antidepressants and ran the numbers. Across thirty-eight clinical trials involving three thousand patients, the benefit of being on an antidepressant was only slightly better than being on a placebo. He sums up the results in his book with the following startling fact: “Improvement in patients who had been given a placebo was about 75% of the response to the real medication.”32

3. The famed science writer John Horgan expressed the same sentiment in his award-winning book, The Undiscovered Mind: “Given the ubiquity of a neurotransmitter such as serotonin and the multiplicity of its functions, it is almost as meaningless to implicate it in depression as it is to implicate blood.”

4. Kindergarten today is all about kids learning the rudiments of reading and writing. Opportunities for unstructured or semistructured play in kindergarten are on the decline, and our young children are being deprived of the lessons in sharing, cooperating, turn taking, and burning off aggressive energy that are built into naturally occurring childhood play. Further, we forget how by its very nature play is pleasurable. When we remove play from kids’ first encounters with school, we stifle the early pleasurable associations kids then usually attach to school. This is not the right start we want to give our children.

5. Kindergartners these days are being dealt a double whammy. Their overall stress is elevated due to their being confronted with academic tasks and social expectations that are beyond their developmental capacities. Then they are deprived of the means to cope with that stress—animated, kinetic, imaginative play. The younger students, or those less socially and emotionally advanced, pay the price. When they wander off, tantrum, hit, dillydally, squirm, squeal, or cuss, they are at risk for being caught up in the kindergarten psychiatric dragnet, when their behavior is often merely a negative reaction to stress.

6. Dr. Robin Fox, best known for founding the anthropology department at Rutgers University, has written widely on how our biosocial makeup as humans is designed to respond best to hunter-gatherer conditions that existed for over 95 percent of human history—not our contemporary automobile-filled, crowded, noisy, artificially lit, urban surrounds. In fact, many human characteristics that are currently classified as psychiatric disorders have helped us survive and cope as a species.

8. Basically, young children are the Pollyannas of the world when it comes to estimating their own abilities. As the parent of any preschool child can tell you, they have an overly optimistic perspective of their own physical and mental abilities and are only minimally influenced by experiences of “failure.” Preschoolers seem to truly believe that they are able to drive racing cars, use power tools, and find their way to Grandma’s house all by themselves; it is only their stubborn and restricting parents who prevent them from displaying these impressive skills. These children have not fully learned the distinction between knowing about something and actually being able to do it.

9. A parent may find his or her offspring’s teenage personality and lifestyle choices repugnant. But this same parent may still love that offspring dearly. Similarly, a teenager might find a parent’s personality quirks and lifestyle choices very off-putting, while still loving that parent. In any relationship, the parent-teen one being no exception, forcing two people who love, but dislike, each other to live in close contact breeds resentment.

10. In the heat of passion, neither of them demonstrated an ability to contain their feelings, pause, listen, and respond to the other’s feelings. This is what empathy is all about. It requires pausing, taking a deep breath or a series of them, staying quiet, and holding back from emotionally reacting. It requires actively showing that you’re listening, and that you’re tuned in and curious about what the person across from you is saying. It involves the ability to show sensitivity to another person’s feelings without being oversensitized or desensitized by them. If you feel compelled to react, you’ve become oversensitized to the other’s feelings; if you tune out, withdraw, and go numb, you’ve become desensitized by them.

11. Perhaps the single most significant thing we can do to incite a conflict is to “mind read” someone else’s motives—more specifically, to mind read their motives as malicious when there’s no real basis for this. This pertains to when we talk as if we have special knowledge about what drives the other person to do the things he or she does, as if we know them better than they know themselves. Throw in the fact that we believe what drives them is something dishonorable, like greed or envy, and we’re playing with fire. Refuse to listen to the more accurate, benign version of their own motives and the war is on.

12. Expectable Rage It’s in vogue these days to assume that teens who rage, like Brandon, have a form of bipolar illness. The focus of the inquiry then becomes the teen as an individual or the teen’s brain. The discourse becomes a medical one. People’s ears and eyes turn away from the possible contribution of the teen’s everyday life situation. Obvious triggers of the rages get overlooked—like a volatile parent-teen relationship marked by loose boundaries, mutual shaming, feelings of entrapment, and poorly developed conflict-resolution skills. On the teen’s end, there are the potential aggravating effects of chronic sleep deprivation, poor diet, alcohol or drug use, school pressure, and insufficient exercise. On the parent’s end, there are the potential aggravating effects of the multitude of roles taken on—social planner, homework tutor, chauffeur, etc.—for an ungrateful teen. The mix, as we’ve seen, can be a volatile one. By plucking the raging teen out of his life situation and viewing him as the sole problem, we do him and his relationships a disservice. Oftentimes, a teen rages only under certain conditions. Not uncommonly, these are relationship conditions. For true and lasting change to occur, we need to carefully attend to and remedy these relationship conditions. Lifestyle adjustments, empathy training, conflict-resolution skill building, and harm-reduction steps, become highly relevant considerations.

13. Other aspects of clinical depression are worth noting to give the reader a sense of perspective about true depressive illness. The socalled “vegetative signs” of depressions are disturbances in sleep and appetite, a flat mood, and a depletion of energy. Disabling depression typically finds someone oversleeping or undersleeping a great deal. There is significant weight loss or gain. The person appears fatigued and sickly. There may be long delays before answers to questions are delivered. Isolation does not serve the purpose it served for Clare. It serves the purpose of escaping from a life that is unbearable and perceived to forever be that way. The person has little energy to be social in basic ways—to smile when smiled at or to wave back when waved to. Attention and concentration are impaired. That’s because the person is so preoccupied with his or her own faults and feelings that he or she has little mental energy in reserve to concentrate on other things. In kids and teens, clinical depression is typically accompanied by more irritability than you see with adults. But it’s pervasive irritability, not fleeting irritability. This is the youngster who has a scowl on his face more often than not, the one who stubbornly holds onto grudges and is generally mopey, unresponsive, and rejecting. This is the youngster who hates his life and means it—not the youngster who says he hates his life for shock value or as a crude and transitory expression of unhappiness. This is the youngster who seriously thinks about dying, about ending a life that has become miserable. We are now in the realm of true illness.

14. PARENTS, BE ON GUARD With new technologies and the lifestyle changes they bring, adolescent culture is changing in ways we barely understand. This is a culture where casual self-promotion doesn’t raise eyebrows, where “rage quits,” “freak-outs,” and “sexting” are familiar teen experiences. Easy access to the Internet, iPods, cell phones, game stations, and cable TV expose teens to expressive options that are loud, raunchy, violent, and over the top. And for parents, running a household is a stressful enterprise. In the words of Elinor Ochs, the anthropologist who headed up the $9 million UCLA study on family life discussed earlier: “The coordination it takes, it’s more complicated than a theatre production. And there are no rehearsals.”28 As the pundits say, high school has become the new college, and the academic pressure that teens face is profound. Adolescent storm and stress has to be understood in this context. When we toss around vague definitions of bipolar disorder in terms of fleeting mood swings, rage outbursts, sexual acting out, and overconfidence, lines get blurred. We run the risk of confusing a difficult adolescent passage with a mental illness. Parents need to keep this distinction in mind when they are in the medical doctor’s office. That’s because the vast majority of medical doctors aren’t schooled to think about how adolescent culture or family events shape a teen’s behavior or about how things like lifestyle adjustments, empathy building, enhanced communication, and conflict resolution hashed out in psychotherapy might help. They are schooled to think about disturbed brains and the cornucopia of medications at their disposal. Unless parents keep all of this in mind, an inaccurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder with inappropriate treatments might ensue, which would surely compound the stress that the family is already experiencing.

15. With the push to screen for and detect autism spectrum disorder at progressively younger ages, the risk is greater that late-talking, picky-eating, tantrum-throwing, transition-resistant toddlers will be misperceived as potentially autistic—especially if an evaluation is conducted in which the child is not sensitively engaged and put at ease. The risk is more acute, as I will soon illustrate, if this toddler is likely to develop into an introverted, cognitively gifted boy who tends to be single-minded and willful in his approach to life learning. Even more basic than that, if we don’t have a firm grasp of gender differences in how young children communicate and socialize, we can mistake traditional masculine behavior for high-functioning autism.

16. HOW BOYS COMMUNICATE AND SOCIALIZE A book I return to every so often is Eleanor Maccoby’s The Two Sexes.9 Her descriptions of boys’ and girls’ different speech styles jive with what I see daily in my office. She maintains, and I agree, that boys’ speech, on average, tends to be more egoistic than girls’. Boys are more apt to brag, interrupt, and talk over others, and ignore commands or suggestions. They are more inclined to grandstand and “hold court,” trying to impress listeners with all that they know. They seem to be less socially attuned than girls. They are less likely to scan the faces and body language of others for cues on whether they should stop talking and start listening—for basic social sensitivity reasons. Simon Baron-Cohen, the Cambridge University professor who popularized the extreme-male-brain theory of autism, would say that boys’ speech is more egoistic because, overall, boys tend to be less empathic than girls.10 He backs this up with abundant scientific evidence. Putting yourself in someone else’s shoes to figure out what they might be feeling comes more naturally to girls. Girls are simply more inclined to read a person’s facial expressions in order to make sure that they are coming across sensitively. Faces tend to be sources of social feedback for girls in ways that they are not for boys. Dr. Baron-Cohen’s research team has discovered that even at birth, female infants will look longer at faces than male infants and prolong mutual eye gazing.

17. for the average male, following along with and responding to the literal content of what they are saying is what’s deemed valuable. A friend is someone who shares your interests and with whom you can have detailed discussions about these interests. Watch boys at a sleepover and you’ll quickly realize that they need a joint activity to buttress social interaction and verbal dialogue. If that joint activity is a videogame like Red Dead Redemption, the discussion will be peppered with pragmatic exchanges of information about how best to tame horses, free someone who has been kidnapped, or locate animal pelts. Without a joint activity that taps into their preexisting knowledge about that activity, boys are often at a loss for discussion. There are long silences. Eye contact is avoided. Bodies become more wiggly. Watch girls at a sleepover and any shared activity they engage in is often secondary to the pleasure they seem to derive from just hanging out and talking.

18. Parenting Tips • Don’t allow children to have TVs, computers, smartphones, or game consoles in their bedrooms, where it can be difficult to monitor what they are watching and for how long. • Institute a “no screens one-hour before bedtime” rule so your child’s sleep is not disrupted. • Always frame access to media devices as a privilege that can be revoked at any time if agreed-upon time limits are not followed or if children resort to viewing inappropriate or forbidden content. • If your child constantly defaults to accessing screens when bored or restless, pull the plug on all screens for a designated amount of time. Help your child generate a list of nonscreen hobbies and activities that he or she can alternately pursue. Agree to restore screen time only when your child has put time and effort into pursuing these hobbies and activities. • Realize that a child will need multiple reminders of when his or her allotted gaming time is about to expire in order to allow him or her some flexibility in deciding the best end point. • Sensitively reframe the anger your child directs at you after hours of video gaming as him or her possibly feeling mad and guilty for mismanaging his or her time. • Eliminate or heavily limit screen time on school days. • Set up summer-camp experiences, sleepovers, and family vacations that are screen-free. • Coordinate with parents of your children’s friends to limit screen time on play dates and sleepovers. • Allow handheld devices to be brought to social events and family outings only on special occasions or long trips. • Understand that the main gateway to mature video games and age-inappropriate TV viewing for kids is an older sibling’s screen habits. Enforce different media rules for siblings depending on their age. Older siblings will need to be encouraged to adopt a stewardship role.

19. The “ten-minute rule” endorsed by the National Education Association is catching on.5 This is the recommendation that ten minutes of homework time be added at each grade level, beginning in the first grade. Second graders should have no more than twenty minutes of homework, third graders no more than thirty minutes of homework, and so forth. The maximum recommended amount of homework in high school is considered to be two hours. The consensus is that homework should reinforce what a student has already learned in the classroom and should not introduce new material.

20. Parenting Tips • Allocate a homework desk for your child to routinely use that is free from as many audio, tactile, and visual distractions as possible. It should be kept reasonably neat. • When financially and logistically possible, take yourself out of the “homework mix” by hiring a tutor. Otherwise, enlist the help of a child’s uncle, aunt, grandparent, or older cousin to step in and oversee the homework situation. • Don’t hover around your child and show outward frustration as he or she is doing homework. This can lead to a child baiting you into an argument that is preferred over having to actually do homework. Calmly redirect him or her back to what needs to be completed and remove yourself from the situation. • Provide descriptive praise targeted at your child’s good work habits: “Look at you sitting at your desk doing your spelling words without getting up and wandering around. That’s true perseverance!” and “My, my I like what my eyes are seeing. You turned off your iPod and have been reading quietly on your own for over half an hour. What concentration!” • Lobby teachers, school officials, and parent-teacher associations to implement the “ten-minute rule” homework guidelines recommended by the National Education Association.

21. Parenting Tips • Maintain a consistent bedtime for your child, with soothing rituals. Consider activities like having your child take a hot bath or shower, listen to comforting music or books-on-tape, or reading a calming book. • Remind yourself that children ages three to five need eleven to thirteen hours of sleep each night; those ages five to twelve need ten to eleven hours; and preteens and teens need at least nine hours. • Carefully monitor caffeine intake. Remember, caffeine has an eight-hour half-life, which means that half the caffeine consumed is chemically active in your kid’s body eight hours after it was consumed. • Forbid screen time for at least an hour before bedtime. • Remove all electronic devices from the child’s bedroom, including cell phones. • Keep the bedroom dark, cool (below seventy-five degrees), and quiet. • Consider the use of earplugs if noise cannot be sufficiently controlled. • Monitor the length of preteen and teen afternoon naps. More than twenty to twenty-five minutes can put them at risk of falling into deeper sleep states and interfere with nighttime sleep patterns.

22. explosive conflict can indicate that a parent is too physically and emotionally absent. When thirteen-year-old Pauline rants at her father, “You are so selfish. For once, can’t you just think of someone other than yourself? I wish I had a different dad. Just get out of my life!” it may be her primitive way of communicating that she feels too alone and vulnerable, and needs more predictable contact with him. Naturally, it goes against the grain to think that a kid’s rage somehow conveys aloneness, vulnerability, and a need for more parental involvement. In the case of Pauline, it would not be surprising if her father launched into his own tirade: “Selfish? Let me tell you about selfish. You, young lady, live in your own damn world!” Pauline would then have gotten negative attention. However, there is wisdom in the old adage, “negative attention is better than no attention at all.” Kids would rather have an angry parent than no parent at all—a parent who is angrily involved, as opposed to icily uninvolved. The opposite of love is not hate; it’s indifference. Sometimes kids would rather have a parent acting hatefully toward them, than indifferently. At least that way, there is emotional heat in the relationship and they have a sense that they matter to the parent.

## Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread From the Data
**Author:** Charles Wheelan

1. Statistics can be overly accessible in the sense that anyone with data and a computer can do sophisticated statistical procedures with a few keystrokes. The problem is that if the data are poor, or if the statistical techniques are used improperly, the conclusions can be wildly misleading and even potentially dangerous. Consider the following hypothetical Internet news flash: People Who Take Short Breaks at Work Are Far More Likely to Die of Cancer. Imagine that headline popping up while you are surfing the Web. According to a seemingly impressive study of 36,000 office workers (a huge data set!), those workers who reported leaving their offices to take regular ten-minute breaks during the workday were 41 percent more likely to develop cancer over the next five years than workers who don’t leave their offices during the workday. Clearly we need to act on this kind of finding—perhaps some kind of national awareness campaign to prevent short breaks on the job. Or maybe we just need to think more clearly about what many workers are doing during that ten-minute break. My professional experience suggests that many of those workers who report leaving their offices for short breaks are huddled outside the entrance of the building smoking cigarettes (creating a haze of smoke through which the rest of us have to walk in order to get in or out). I would further infer that it’s probably the cigarettes, and not the short breaks from work, that are causing the cancer. I’ve made up this example just so that it would be particularly absurd, but I can assure you that many real-life statistical abominations are nearly this absurd once they are deconstructed.

3. We ought to begin with the crucial distinction between “precision” and “accuracy.” These words are not interchangeable. Precision reflects the exactitude with which we can express something. In a description of the length of your commute, “41.6 miles” is more precise than “about 40 miles,” which is more precise than “a long f——ing way.” If you ask me how far it is to the nearest gas station, and I tell you that it’s 1.265 miles to the east, that’s a precise answer. Here is the problem: That answer may be entirely inaccurate if the gas station happens to be in the other direction. On the other hand, if I tell you, “Drive ten minutes or so until you see a hot dog stand. The gas station will be a couple hundred yards after that on the right. If you pass the Hooters, you’ve gone too far,” my answer is less precise than “1.265 miles to the east” but significantly better because I am sending you in the direction of the gas station. Accuracy is a measure of whether a figure is broadly consistent with the truth—hence the danger of confusing precision with accuracy. If an answer is accurate, then more precision is usually better. But no amount of precision can make up for inaccuracy.

4. Statistics measure the outcomes that matter; incentives give us a reason to improve those outcomes.

5. A correlation of –1, or perfect negative correlation, means that every change in one variable is associated with an equivalent change in the other variable in the opposite direction. The closer the correlation is to 1 or –1, the stronger the association. A correlation of 0 (or close to it) means that the variables have no meaningful association with one another, such as the relationship between shoe size and SAT scores.

6. The probability of two independent events’ both happening is the product of their respective probabilities.

7. If you have a six-digit password using only numerical digits, we can calculate the number of possible passwords: 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10, which equals 106, or 1,000,000. That sounds like a lot of possibilities, but a computer could blow through all 1,000,000 possible combinations in a fraction of a second. So let’s suppose that your system administrator harangues you long enough that you include letters in your password. At that point, each of the 6 digits now has 36 combinations: 26 letters and 10 digits. The number of possible passwords grows to 36 × 36 × 36 × 36 × 36 × 36, or 366, which is over two billion. If your administrator demands eight digits and urges you to use symbols like #, @, % and !, as the University of Chicago does, the number of potential passwords climbs to 468, or just over 20 trillion.

8. Suppose you are interested in the probability that one event happens or another event happens: outcome A or outcome B (again assuming that they are independent). In this case, the probability of getting A or B consists of the sum of their individual probabilities: the probability of A plus the probability of B. For example, the likelihood of throwing a 1, 2, or 3, with a single die is the sum of their individual probabilities: + + = = ½.

9. As a consumer, you should recognize that insurance will not save you money in the long run. What it will do is prevent some unacceptably high loss, such as replacing a $40,000 car that was stolen or a $350,000 house that burned down. Buying insurance is a “bad bet” from a statistical standpoint since you will pay the insurance company, on average, more than you get back. Yet it can still be a sensible tool for protecting against outcomes that would otherwise wreck your life. Ironically, someone as rich as Warren Buffett can save money by not purchasing car insurance, homeowner’s insurance, or even health insurance because he can afford whatever bad things might happen to him.

10. The broader lesson—and one of the core lessons of personal finance—is that you should always insure yourself against any adverse contingency that you cannot comfortably afford to withstand. You should skip buying insurance on everything else.

11. Not understanding when events ARE independent. A different kind of mistake occurs when events that are independent are not treated as such. If you find yourself in a casino (a place, statistically speaking, that you should not go to), you will see people looking longingly at the dice or cards and declaring that they are “due.” If the roulette ball has landed on black five times in a row, then clearly now it must turn up red. No, no, no! The probability of the ball’s landing on a red number remains unchanged: 16/38. The belief otherwise is sometimes called “the gambler’s fallacy.” In fact, if you flip a fair coin 1,000,000 times and get 1,000,000 heads in a row, the probability of getting tails on the next flip is still ½.

12. As a curious side note, researchers have also documented a Businessweek phenomenon. When CEOs receive high-profile awards, including being named one of Businessweek’s “Best Managers,” their companies subsequently underperform over the next three years as measured by both accounting profits and stock price. However, unlike the Sports Illustrated effect, this effect appears to be more than reversion to the mean. According to Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate, economists at the University of California at Berkeley and UCLA, respectively, when CEOs achieve “superstar” status, they get distracted by their new prominence.7 They write their memoirs. They are invited to sit on outside boards. They begin searching for trophy spouses. (The authors propose only the first two explanations, but I find the last one plausible as well.) Malmendier and Tate write, “Our results suggest that media-induced superstar culture leads to behavioral distortions beyond mere mean reversion.” In other words, when a CEO appears on the cover of Businessweek, sell the stock.

13. (1) A representative sample is a fabulously important thing, for it opens the door to some of the most powerful tools that statistics has to offer. (2) Getting a good sample is harder than it looks. (3) Many of the most egregious statistical assertions are caused by good statistical methods applied to bad samples, not the opposite. (4) Size matters, and bigger is better.

14. The core principle underlying the central limit theorem is that a large, properly drawn sample will resemble the population from which it is drawn. Obviously there will be variation from sample to sample (e.g., each bus headed to the start of the marathon will have a slightly different mix of passengers), but the probability that any sample will deviate massively from the underlying population is very low.

19. 4. Last, if we know the underlying characteristics of two samples, we can infer whether or not both samples were likely drawn from the same population.

20. 1. The standard deviation measures dispersion in the underlying population. In this case, it might measure the dispersion of the weights of all the participants in the Framingham Heart Study, or the dispersion around the mean for the entire marathon field. 2. The standard error measures the dispersion of the sample means. If we draw repeated samples of 100 participants from the Framingham Heart Study, what will the dispersion of those sample means look like? 3. Here is what ties the two concepts together: The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample means!

21. In the formal language of statistical inference, researchers would likely conclude the following: (1) If the experimental drug has no effect, we would rarely see this amount of variation in outcomes between those who are receiving the drug and those who are taking the placebo. (2) It is therefore highly improbable that the drug has no positive effect. (3) The alternative—and more likely—explanation for the pattern of data observed is that the experimental drug has a positive effect.
   - Location: 2494-2498

22. Consider some examples. Null hypothesis: This new experimental drug is no more effective at preventing malaria than a placebo. Alternative hypothesis: This new experimental drug can help to prevent malaria. The data: One group is randomly chosen to receive the new experimental drug, and a control group receives a placebo. At the end of some period of time, the group receiving the experimental drug has far fewer cases of malaria than the control group. This would be an extremely unlikely outcome if the experimental drug had no medical impact. As a result, we reject the null hypothesis that the new drug has no impact (beyond that of a placebo), and we accept the logical alternative, which is our alternative hypothesis: This new experimental drug can help to prevent malaria. This methodological approach is strange enough that we should do one more example. Again, note that the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are logical complements. If one is true, the other is not true. Or, if we reject one statement, we must accept the other. Null hypothesis: Substance abuse treatment for prisoners does not reduce their rearrest rate after leaving prison. Alternative hypothesis: Substance abuse treatment for prisoners will make them less likely to be rearrested after they are released. The (hypothetical) data: Prisoners were randomly assigned into two groups; the “treatment” group received substance abuse treatment and the control group did not. (This is one of those cool occasions when the treatment group actually gets treatment!) At the end of five years, both groups have similar rearrest rates. In this case, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.* The data have given us no reason to discard our beginning assumption that substance abuse treatment is not an effective tool for keeping ex-offenders from returning to prison. It may seem counterintuitive, but researchers often create a null hypothesis in hopes of being able to reject it. In both of the examples above, a research “success” (finding a new malaria drug or reducing recidivism) involved rejecting the null hypothesis. The data made that possible in only one of the cases (the malaria drug).

## God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine
**Author:** Victoria Sweet

### Highlights (4)

1. Ever since the duties of the monk infirmarian had been split between doctor and nurse, and the Latin curare split into cure and care, there’d been a battle going on for control. Who would be in command of the hospital? Doctor or nurse? Whose model of curare would triumph? Cure or care? And this battle was joined at the French Revolution, when the doctors tried to wrest control of the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris from its nursing nuns. For more than a thousand years the nuns ran the Hôtel-Dieu: Caring for the sick poor defined their monastic vocation. They provided food, shelter, and spiritual care; they nursed the sick; and only when necessary did they call in a physician. Until the end of the eighteenth century that was just fine with the doctors, because the sick poor at the Hôtel-Dieu did not offer them a pecuniary or any other reward. But around the time of the French Revolution, medicine, like so much else, was changing. Doctors were beginning to believe that the best way to understand the body was to correlate their treatments with what happened to their patients. They started to keep careful records and perform autopsies on patients who died. Their records and their autopsies allowed them to relate the course of a disease to the dysfunction of internal organs, and to connect their physical examination of the living body to the pathophysiology they found inside the corpse. These were powerful innovations; they would provide much of the data for our bible, DeGowin & DeGowin. And the reason that the doctors of Revolutionary France suddenly wanted control of the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris was that the best “material” for their new approach was at the Hôtel-Dieu—the most varied patients, the most multitudinous, and the most compliant. The doctors convinced the Revolution’s administration to remove control of the Hôtel-Dieu from the nuns and give it to them. The nuns protested. They refused to serve under the doctors. The head nun at the Hôtel-Dieu had always come before the physician, they argued. The idea of using patients—Christ’s charges—as experimental objects was a murderous, a disastrous idea, they said. They were turned down, but step by step they went up the levels of administration. Finally they were ordered to leave the Hôtel-Dieu if they remained unwilling to obey the doctors. They did remain unwilling, and they also refused to leave. They declared that should workmen attempt to enter their wards to begin any alterations of the old structure, they would stand fast and prevent them. With this, the administration buckled and rescinded its order, returning control of the Hôtel-Dieu to the nursing nuns. And there they remained for the next one hundred and fifty years, taking care of their patients until France secularized the institution in the early 1900s. Then the nuns left.

3. Community comes from the Latin communio, for which the Oxford Latin Dictionary gives two derivations. Communio as a verb comes from munio—wall—and means “to build a wall around.” So a community is defined by the wall—symbolic or otherwise—around it. Everything inside the wall is the community, and everything outside the wall isn’t.

## 50 Human Brain Ideas You Really Need to Know (50 Ideas You Really Need to Know series)
**Author:** Moheb Costandi

### Highlights (88)

1. Neurons also communicate with each other via electrical synapses called gap junctions. These are made of proteins called connexins, which span the cell membranes and connect the inside of adjacent cells. Gap junctions allow for instantaneous electrical signalling between neurons, so that networks of interconnected cells can fire in synchrony as currents pass between them.
   - Location: 469-472
   - Page: 31

2. The brain contains something like one quadrillion (one thousand million million) synapses, and produces about one hundred different neurotransmitters. Glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine are amino acid transmitters. The monoamines are another group of transmitters, including dopamine, adrenaline and serotonin. Dopamine is often referred to as ‘the pleasure molecule’ because it is involved in reward, but it also has important roles in attention, memory and movement. Serotonin plays a vital part in mood. The neuropeptides are small proteins crucial in pain signalling, while the endocannabinoids, a group of transmitters that have gained increasing attention in recent years, are involved in appetite, mood and memory. Other neurotransmitters include acetylcholine – which motor neurons use to send signals to the muscles, and which is also used in the autonomic nervous system – and nitric oxide, a gas thought to play an important role in learning and memory.

4. Physicist Richard Feynman was what is known as a ‘grapheme-colour synaesthete’ – in other words, he experienced specific colours in response to letters and numbers – while expressionist artist Wassily Kandinsky was a ‘tone-colour synaesthete’, who associated musical tones with colours. Other forms include ‘mirror-touch synaesthesia’ (seeing another person being touched evokes touch sensations), and ‘time-space synaesthesia’ (units of time, such as days and months, are seen as occupying specific locations in space relative to the body). Synaesthesia was once thought to be extremely rare, but is now estimated to affect about 1 per cent of the population.

6. The idea that cognitive functions are localized to specific parts of the brain is referred to as ‘functional modularity’, or the ‘localization of cerebral function’. Its origins can be traced back to the late 18th century, when Franz Joseph Gall developed phrenology, which linked personality traits to bumps on the skull. Phrenology was hugely popular throughout the 19th century, but was eventually dismissed as a pseudoscience.
   - Location: 751-754
   - Page: 49

7. The localization of cerebral function gained scientific credibility in the midto late 19th century through the work of two neurologists who observed that patients with speech deficits had suffered damage to distinct parts of the brain. One of these was the French physician Pierre Paul Broca, who studied patients who had lost the ability to speak after suffering a stroke. Broca examined their brains after they died, and noticed that they had all sustained damage to the same part of the left frontal lobe. This region came to be known as Broca’s Area, and the inability to produce speech following a stroke is often referred to as Broca’s aphasia. About ten years later, a German physician named Carl Wernicke studied stroke patients who had lost the ability to understand spoken language. When he examined their brains, he noticed that they had all sustained damage to another specific part of the brain. Wernicke’s Area, as it is now known, is located in the left temporal lobe, and the inability to understand speech after a stroke is sometimes referred to as Wernicke’s aphasia.

8. Some researchers have criticized the idea that the cerebral cortex contains discrete, specialized areas and favour instead the idea of ‘distributive processing’. One such was the physiologist Karl Lashley. In the 1920s, Lashley performed a series of famous experiments designed to determine where memories are stored in the brain. He taught rats to find their way through a maze, then damaged parts of their cerebral cortex to try to erase the memory trace. He found that the rats could always find their way through the maze again, no matter where the damage was. Based on these observations, Lashley concluded that memory function is not located in a discrete region of the cortex, but is instead distributed throughout the brain.
   - Location: 788-793
   - Page: 52

9. Functional modularity and distributive processing are not mutually exclusive, however. Indeed, the current view of how the brain works is a combination of the two ideas. Neuroscientists now think that the brain operates as what they call a ‘massively parallel distributed processor’, with multiple networks working together to generate thoughts and behaviour. In other words, the brain does contain discrete areas specialized to perform specific functions, but individual specialized brain areas do not act on their own. Instead, each one can be thought of as a node within a network that is distributed throughout the brain or within particular regions. Each network contains multiple, interconnected brain regions cooperating to encode particular types of information or generate certain behaviours. Within each network, information is processed serially, or transferred from one area to the next, processing it one after the other. Multiple networks probably work simultaneously, and, at a higher level of organization, activity from multiple networks is integrated, giving rise to the summed patterns of activity that generate our thoughts and behaviours.

10. Mirror neurons are cells that fire during both the execution and observation of a specific action. They have been linked to many behaviours and abilities, from empathy to learning by imitation, as well as implicated in conditions such as autism. Mirror neurons were discovered in monkeys, but it’s still not clear whether they also exist in the human brain.
   - Location: 905-907
   - Page: 59

11. In the late 1990s, two groups of researchers independently proposed the so-called broken-mirror hypothesis, which states the social impairments characteristic of autism are caused by defects in the mirror neuron system. The broken-mirror hypothesis has received considerable attention in the mass media, but has been the subject of severe criticism by many autism researchers. It is based on assumptions that mirror neurons are involved in understanding action, imitation and language acquisition, and that people with autism are insensitive to the emotions and intentions of others. Critics say both that the first assumption is actually false, and also that there is evidence that people with autism are in fact overly sensitive to others’ emotions and intentions. What’s more, the broken-mirror hypothesis does not attempt to explain how the mirror neuron system is defective, or how the defects might arise.
   - Location: 937-943
   - Page: 62

12. But do we have mirror neurons? Mirror neurons have proven to be highly controversial. A handful of brain-scanning studies show that several regions of the brain are activated during both action execution and observation, and it has been suggested that these areas constitute the human mirror system. But while hundreds of other studies attempt to explain their results by alluding to mirror neurons, very few actually provide hard evidence. So there is, as yet, very little convincing direct evidence that mirror neurons exist in the human brain. In fact, a number of studies have failed to find evidence of human mirror neurons altogether.
   - Location: 943-949
   - Page: 62

13. The researchers who originally discovered mirror neurons in the monkey brain have recently refined their claims, and now suggest that the cells have a far more restricted role than was originally thought. Instead of being involved in understanding the actions of others, they suggest that the cells play a role in helping us to understand, ‘from the inside’, actions that we already know how to perform.

14. The brain contains about 90 billion neurons and is roughly the size of two clenched fists, but it’s not the overall size, or the total number of cells, that’s important. What matters is how the neurons are connected to each other.
   - Location: 982-984
   - Page: 65

15. It is now widely believed, for example, that memory formation involves the strengthening of synapses within distributed networks of neurons, and that conditions such as strokes can be debilitating not only because they kill cells, but also because they disrupt long-distance neuronal connections.
   - Location: 988-990

16. Diffusion tensor imaging: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that detects the movements of water molecules along nerve fibres in the living human brain. It can be used to visualize the white matter tracts that form long-distance connections between brain regions.
   - Location: 1011-1013

17. Genetic methods: Two recently developed methods allow researchers to visualize neuronal networks and synaptic connections in unprecedented detail. Researchers in California used genetic engineering to create modified rabies viruses that produce a fluorescent protein. When inserted into a neuron, it jumps across the synapses to ‘highlight’ all the other cells with which it forms connections.
   - Location: 1013-1016
   - Page: 67

18. The other genetic method, called Brainbow, was developed by researchers at Harvard University, and involves creating genetically engineered mice whose cells contain a set of genes encoding five or six fluorescent proteins of different colours. The genes are organized in such a way that each neuron synthesizes a random combination of two or three fluorescent proteins, thus producing a palette of around 100 different colours. The brain can then be dissected and examined under the microscope, to reveal the fluorescently labelled neurons.

19. Caenorhabditis elegans is a roundworm measuring just 1mm in length and with a nervous system containing a grand total of 304 neurons. Researchers began mapping its connectome in the 1970s, slicing the worms into hundreds of pieces, using electron microscopy to visualize each slice, then reconstructing the pieces to generate a map of all 5,000 connections in the nervous system. The process took more than ten years, and the connectome was finally published in 1986. Many people thought that mapping the C. elegans connectome would lead to a huge leap in our understanding of this tiny creature’s nervous system, but it did not. Today, nearly 30 years after the connectome was published, we still do not know how the C. elegans nervous system – which is very simple compared to our own – generates the worm’s behaviours.

   - Page: 67

20. The great unknowns Although methods for detailed analysis of human brain connectivity are not yet available, technological advances will make a comprehensive map possible at some point in the future. Meanwhile, we can learn much from mice and monkeys, whose brains have an anatomical organization similar to that of our own. There’s no doubt that a complete human connectome will provide valuable insights into brain function but, as researchers already know from the nematode worm connectome, there are limitations to what it can tell us. The concept of the connectome ignores the role of genes, and how their interactions with the environment influence our behaviour. It also ignores the role of glial cells, particularly astrocytes, which play important roles in brain function. Another important limitation: although all human brains have the same basic structure, there are significant structural variations between individuals. Consequently, there may be no such thing as a ‘typical’ brain. Researchers will therefore have to produce the connectomes of as many brains as possible to produce a generalized map of the human brain. Furthermore, the brain is highly dynamic, and its connections are constantly changing. A static connectivity map would not take these changes into account, and it may be necessary to produce numerous connectomes for each individual, to determine exactly how neural connections change with time.

21. Embodied cognition Traditionally, the brain is thought of as the master controller – generating thoughts and actions by converting abstract representations of the world into commands for the body. According to a new theory, however, thoughts and behaviours are not produced by the brain alone, but are the result of dynamic interactions between the brain, the body and the environment.
   - Location: 1057-1060
   - Page: 69

22. The brain is usually viewed as an organ that controls behaviour by processing perceptions of the outside world and transforming them into mental representations which are then used to guide thoughts and behaviour. In other words, the brain acts to process abstract information, and our knowledge of the world resides in memory systems that are separate from action and perception. The embodied cognition hypothesis is a radical new idea that rejects this traditional view. It regards the brain as one component of a wider system that also includes the body and the environment, both of which are critical for shaping our thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Thus, our mental representations are ‘embodied’, or grounded, in the physical state of the body and its interactions with the environment. As such, they are intimately linked to the brain’s sensory and motor systems.
   - Location: 1061-1067
   - Page: 70

23. The idea of embodied cognition originates in continental philosophy. Immanuel Kant believed that the mind was distinct from the body, but that the two were closely related; he also believed that our ability to think is dependent upon the properties of our bodies. For Kant, bodily movements are necessary for thinking, and for recalling and connecting mental representations. Nearly two centuries later, Martin Heidegger argued that we experience the world by interacting with it, and that thinking involves putting things to use. Likewise, Maurice Merleau-Ponty believed that the body is not just an object of perception, but is also crucial for it. ‘The body … serves to impress notions of external objects … and to recall and connect them interiorly … [It] is indispensable for thinking.’ Immanuel Kant, 1755 Metaphorical grounding Early embodied cognition theorists emphasized the effects of the body on thought processes. They argued that language is closely linked to the perception of the body and that the metaphors we use are shaped to the form of our bodies. Thus, our experiences are grounded in metaphorical thoughts, which are in turn based on how we use our bodies to interact with the world. Similarly, we often express emotions in terms of movements or positions in space. Positive emotions are always associated with upward movements (we may say that our ‘spirit soared’, or that we are feeling ‘on top of the world’), while negative thoughts are linked with downward movements (for example, feeling ‘down in the dumps’). Numerous studies support this view, showing that bodily states can indeed strongly influence, or directly cause, mental states. For example, you perceive people as being friendlier when you are holding a warm cup of coffee than when you are holding a cold one; you are more likely to wash your hands after thinking about bad deeds than about good ones; and you will perceive a heavy book as being more important than a lighter one. This type of research shows the importance of embodied metaphorical thought – affection is warmth; immoral actions are dirty whereas moral acts are pure; and important subjects are ‘weighty’. According to some researchers, however, these studies are just the tip of the iceberg, and do not demonstrate ‘true’ embodied cognition. They argue that behaviour emerges from dynamic interactions not only between the brain and the body, but also the external environment. This view emphasizes the importance of our actions and perceptions, as well as the process of simulation, or re-enactment of actions and perceptions. Far from being abstract, the brain’s mental representations are thus closely tied to – and dependent upon – the events that we experience.

24. Existentialist philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Maurice Merleau-Ponty knew that what we call the ‘self’ is intimately connected to the body, and neuroscience is finally beginning to catch up. Modern research has begun to reveal the neurological basis of bodily recognition, and to show that such awareness of one’s body is a core component of self-identity.

25. Investigations of bodily awareness began over a hundred years ago, with the work of the British neurologists Henry Head and Gordon Holmes. They studied dozens of patients in whom bodily awareness was disturbed following damage to the right parietal lobe, and concluded that this part of the brain contains a dynamic representation of the body, or a model of the self, which they referred to as the ‘body schema’. Modern research has revealed that the brain does indeed encode multiple representations of the body, and that bodily awareness consists of two related but distinct components. Each of these components can be distorted or manipulated separately, but both are critically important for self-consciousness. ‘Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something about the body.’ Friedrich Nietzsche, 1883 Body ownership We usually experience ourselves as being located within our bodies, and recognize our bodies as our own. This is because the brain distinguishes between what is part of one’s self and what is not, giving rise to the sense of body ownership, one of the components of bodily awareness. But sometimes body ownership is disrupted – for example, during out-of-body experiences (in which the ‘self’ appears to leave the physical body temporarily), in a delusion called somatoparaphrenia (in which patients deny that a limb belongs to them) and in a condition called body integrity identity disorder (in which individuals have a burning desire to amputate a healthy limb). Distortions in the sense of body ownership are not only limited to psychiatric conditions, however, but also occur in everyday life. Head and Holmes suggested that ‘anything which participates in the conscious movement of our bodies is added to the model of ourselves’, and that a woman’s body schema ‘may extend to the feather in her hat’. We now know that using a computer mouse or a tool causes the object to be incorporated into the brain’s representation of the body. In other words, the brain comes to regard foreign objects as a part of the ‘self’ after prolonged use. This explains why a blind man can ‘feel’ with his cane. Crucially, it will eventually lead to a new generation of artificial limbs that the brain recognizes to be part of the body.

26. Agency and free will The other component of bodily awareness is agency, that is, the sense that we are in control of our own bodies and are responsible for our actions. Agency depends upon so-called forward models generated in the brain, which predict the consequences of any actions. When you decide to turn on a light, for example, your brain predicts that you will reach for and then touch the switch on the wall, and that you will then hear a click and see the room light up. These predictions are then compared to what actually happens, and a close correspondence between the two gives us the sense that we are in control of our actions. Research into the underlying mechanisms suggests that the brain actively distorts time perception to give rise to the sense of agency, to make us think that we are in control. Some experiments suggest that voluntary movements are perceived as occurring later than they do, whereas their effects are perceived as occurring earlier than they actually do, so that the intention of an action and its effects are perceived as occurring together. Other studies have found that the brain reverses the order of events, so that the effects are perceived a fraction of a second before the action that caused them. There is a delay of about 80 milliseconds between when something happens and when we perceive it, because of the time taken by the brain to process information. According to these results, the brain recalibrates the timing of events to make them consistent with our expectations.

27. The sense of agency is important because it leads to the conscious experience of ‘free will’, and it also contributes to the sense of body ownership by confirming that the hand performing the action belongs to you. In some conditions, however, the sense of agency is disrupted: in alien hand syndrome, a rare psychiatric disorder, patients deny that they are in control of the actions of one of their upper limbs; and in schizophrenia, patients often misattribute their thoughts and actions to external, controlling forces.

28. Simple manipulations of the sensory inputs to the brain give rise to illusions that alter its representation of the body and distort the sense of self. In the rubber hand illusion, touch sensations are perceived to arise from an artificial hand. The illusion is induced by simultaneously touching the rubber hand and the real one in exactly the same way, while the participant looks at the rubber hand. This creates a discrepancy of sensations that tricks the brain into thinking that the rubber hand is part of the body, and shows that vision is the most important sense for body ownership.

29. Bodily awareness arises through something called multisensory integration – in real terms, the brain combines three different types of sensory inputs that it receives from the body: visual information, touch information and proprioceptive information (relating to the position of the limbs in space). Visual information is processed in the occipital lobe, whereas touch and proprioception inputs are processed in the somatosensory cortex. The three are then combined in the superior parietal lobule, to generate a dynamic representation of the body that is variously referred to as the body schema or body image. This representation manifests itself as a mental picture of the body, and it is through this picture that we perceive our bodies. Disturbances in awareness of the body can change the brain’s representation of it, which in turn can profoundly alter the sense of self. For example, discrepancies between body image and the physical form of the body can produce cognitive dissonance (conflicting thoughts and feelings that are psychologically distressing), and may contribute to, for instance, anorexia, body dysmorphic disorder or transsexualism.

30. Free won’t? Early evidence against free will comes from a classic 1983 study that measured the brain activity associated with voluntary hand movements. In a relatively simple experiment, researchers asked study participants to move their fingers whenever they felt the urge to do so. They also had to look at a blank clock face with a dot moving around it, and note the position of the dot when they became aware of the intention to move. The researchers used electroencephalography (EEG) to record participants’ brain activity, and detected a signal called the ‘readiness potential’ in the supplementary motor area, a part of the frontal cortex involved in planning movements. Surprisingly, they detected this signal about a third of a second before the participants reported becoming aware of the intention to move their fingers. Several other research groups have obtained similar results using modern techniques. In 2008, researchers in London used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan participants’ brains while they decided between pressing two buttons, using either the left or the right index finger. A series of letters appeared on a small screen inside the scanner, and the participants had to note which was displayed at the time they made the decision to press one of the buttons. The researchers found that motor cortex activity could predict, with an accuracy of around 60 per cent, which of the two buttons the participants would press, up to 10 seconds before they became aware of the intention to act. More recently, the original findings were confirmed yet again by a team of American neurosurgeons, who used electrodes to record directly from neurons in the brains of epilepsy patients while they performed self-initiated finger movements. They found that single cells in the motor cortex become active up to a second and a half before the patients reported making the decision to move.

31. The research has been widely criticized, however. The main problem is that the studies rely on participants’ perception of time and their subjective reports of the timing of events. These events occur within fractions of a second, making it extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly when they occurred. This is further complicated by the brain’s processing time – it takes a fraction of a second to interpret visual information, and another fraction to produce a motor output. The time periods are so small that in everyday life these processes seem to happen instantaneously, but in experiments such as these, they can make a huge difference. Another problem: it’s not entirely clear exactly what the readiness potential is. Until recently, it was widely thought to be a neural signature of the planning, preparation and initiation of voluntary movements, a gradual build-up of neuronal activity that occurs in the premotor cortex in the seconds prior to executing an action. But several studies suggest otherwise. In one of these, researchers from New Zealand used EEG to compare the brain activity preceding the decision to move with activity preceding the decision not to move. They detected the same pattern of electrical activity in both cases, suggesting that the readiness potential does not represent the brain preparing to move.

33. Psychologists now generally agree that there are five main personality traits:   Extroversion is defined as the ‘act of being predominantly concerned with and obtaining gratification from what is outside the self’, and exists on a continuum with introversion, or a ‘tendency towards being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one’s own mental life’. Extroverts tend to be outgoing and gregarious, taking pleasure in social events, whereas introverts tend to be quiet and reserved, and prefer solitary activities such as reading. Neuroticism manifests itself as anxiety, moodiness and irritability. People who score highly on neuroticism are often shy and self-conscious. They are highly sensitive to negative emotions, and can therefore perceive otherwise normal situations as threatening. They also have a higher risk of developing depression. Conscientiousness is a trait that equates roughly to will power, and is manifested in behaviours such as efficiency, neatness and deliberation. Conscientious individuals tend to be reliable and hard working, whereas those who score low on this trait tend to be easy-going and less goal-driven. Agreeableness is defined by behaviours that are thought of as being kind, considerate, cooperative and sympathetic. People who score highly on this trait tend to be altruistic, modest and trustworthy, while those who score low tend to be less concerned with others’ well-being and have less empathy. Openness is a trait characterized primarily by creativity, imagination and intellectual curiosity. People who score highly on openness tend to actively seek novel experiences and have liberal political views, whereas those who score low tend to be closed to new experiences and have conservative political views.

36. Attention is the process by which we concentrate on certain things while ignoring others. It is the gatekeeper of awareness – we do not perceive something if we don’t pay attention to it – but our capacity to pay attention is strictly limited to four items, and the brain’s attentional mechanisms are highly selective.

40. Your brain has an apparently infinite capacity for acquiring new information, and contains several distinct subsystems for learning and storing different types of data. The cellular basis of learning and memory is one of the most intensively studied topics in neuroscience, with decades of research revealing that learning changes the physical structure of the brain.

41. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which behaviour is modified by its consequences. It was first studied by the American psychologist Edward Thorndike,

42. The behaviourist B.F. Skinner subsequently explained operant conditioning in more detail, using the concepts of reinforcement and punishment. Positive reinforcement strengthens a behaviour by rewarding it, whereas negative reinforcement strengthens a behaviour that removes an aversive stimulus.

44. From decades of research, we know that the nature of memory is reconstructive, rather than reproductive. It does not work like a video recorder, storing events exactly as they happened. Instead, retrieving a memory involves stitching together small fragments of information into a meaningful narrative. Memory recall is therefore prone to errors, which creep in during the reconstructive process. Most of the time, our memories are accurate enough to be reliable. Sometimes, however, the errors can be so big that they make a memory completely unreliable, as in the case of confabulation and false memories.
   - Location: 1941-1945
   - Page: 127

45. Indeed, some researchers now argue that simulating future events is the main function of autobiographical memory, and the reason why memory evolved to be a reconstructive process instead of a reproductive one. It is because of the reconstructive nature of autobiographical memory that we can imagine events that have not yet transpired. We piece together fragments of memories of real events from our past, to generate hypothetical simulations of future events. This enables us to predict, with some degree of accuracy, how an event that we have not yet experienced will unfold, so that we can decide on the best possible course of action when the time comes.

47. losing sleep could impair memory. This is also borne out in the research, which shows that sleep deprivation not only impedes performance on memory tasks, but also hampers our ability to retrieve existing memories from long-term storage. More recently, sleep deprivation has also been shown to enhance our propensity to create false memories – this has implications for interrogation methods that involve keeping suspects awake for prolonged periods of time.

49. Decision-making involves evaluating the risks and rewards associated with alternative choices then choosing the best possible course of action. Neuroscience is beginning to reveal the brain mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. By highlighting the role of emotions, it is also challenging the traditional view that it is a purely rational process.

50. Neuroeconomics Traditionally, economists regarded decision-making as a rational process in which we choose between the available options by systematically weighing up the relative risks and rewards of each and then taking the course of action with the maximum value. This classical view, referred to as utility theory, ignores the role of intuition and emotions, however. Neuroeconomics is an emerging multidisciplinary area of research that combines methods from economics, behavioural psychology and neuroscience; it seeks to address the shortcomings in how economists view decision-making.

51. The tip of a growing axon consists of a growth cone, a cone-shaped structure approximately ten-thousandths of a millimetre wide that contains numerous finger-like protuberances called filopodia. Growth cones contain receptors for the numerous guidance cues that steer growing axons along the correct path. As a nerve fibre extends, the growth cone extends and retracts its filopodia, sniffing out the guidance cues along the way. Axon guidance cues therefore act like signposts, directing the growth cone to turn at specific locations, or continue moving straight ahead. Each type of cue initiates a distinct biochemical reaction, which leads to the reorganization of structural elements within the growth cone. For example, repulsive cues cause the growth cone to collapse on one side and to rebuild itself on the opposite side. This results in extension of the nerve fibre away from the repulsive cue.

55. The ‘core’ cell death machinery is a family of executioner proteins called caspases, inactive forms of which are found in all cells. When cell death is triggered, caspases are converted to their active forms, which then act as molecular scissors, moving around the cell and destroying other proteins essential for proper cell function. This causes a series of characteristic structural changes: the cell membrane starts to bleb, or bulge; the cell’s DNA becomes fragmented and the nucleus is broken apart; and finally, the whole cell breaks up into smaller fragments called apoptotic bodies.

56. The elimination of certain synapses is critical for neural development as well as for proper functioning of the mature brain – the brain not only makes new synaptic connections throughout life, but also breaks them. Such ‘pruning’ is crucial for processes such as learning and memory, with recent research revealing a surprising mechanism by which it can occur.

57. Contrary to an age-old dogma, neural circuits in the adult brain are not ‘hard-wired’, but change continuously throughout life as a result of our experiences, in a number of different ways. These changes are collectively referred to as ‘neuroplasticity’, but the term is poorly defined, and widely used and abused.

58. Neurogenesis: the production of new nerve cells. From decades of research, we know that several discrete regions of the brains of adult mice and rats continue to generate new neurons, and that newborn neurons make important contributions to information processing. Whether or not this also happens in the human brain is still unclear, however.

59. Synaptic plasticity: the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections between neurons. It occurs in two forms: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which refer to the enhancement and diminishment of synaptic transmission, respectively. Synaptic plasticity is the most extensively studied and best understood type of neuroplasticity.
   - Location: 2618-2621

60. Synaptogenesis: the formation of new connections between neurons. Neurons can sprout new dendritic spines – the tiny, finger-like projections at which synaptic transmission occurs. This has been observed directly in animals, and probably occurs in the human brain, too, but we haven’t seen it because the techniques used in animals aren’t applicable to people.

61. One of the best examples comes from studies of London taxi drivers, who spend up to four years learning the layout of the city’s streets. Researchers have found that acquiring the ‘knowledge’ causes an increase in the volume of the hippocampus, which is involved in generating maps and storing memories of how to navigate, and that the more experienced a taxi driver is, the greater the density of grey matter in the hippocampus. It’s not clear exactly what causes these changes, but one possible explanation is the formation of new synapses.

62. More recently, researchers in London used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare the brains of karate black belts with those of novices, and found differences in the microscopic structure of the brain’s white matter tracts. Black belts have a greater density of tracts connecting the cerebellum and motor cortex. This is the result of years of practice, and it enables them to pack a more powerful punch.

63. In recent years, neuroplasticity has become a popular buzzword, used to explain all sorts of neurological phenomena that we still do not understand. Self-help gurus and charlatans even proclaim that their programmes induce neuroplasticity and ‘rewire the brain’. When used so loosely, and without further explanation, the term becomes completely meaningless.
   - Location: 2652-2655
   - Page: 173

64. Synaptic plasticity occurs widely and constantly throughout the brain, however, for many other reasons, and it is estimated that the human brain forms about one million new connections every second of our lives. But research also suggests that the brain’s ability to reorganize itself diminishes with age.
   - Location: 2658-2660
   - Page: 174

65. Not all neuroplasticity is beneficial. It’s well known, for example, that addiction to cocaine and other drugs, including alcohol and nicotine, involves synaptic plasticity within the reward circuits that use dopamine. A single dose of a drug is enough to alter synaptic transmission, and prolonged drug use causes long-lasting changes at the synapses, leading to cravings, drug-seeking behaviour and relapse into drug use.

67. Adolescence is a uniquely human phenomenon, a period of life marked by a peak in risk-taking behaviour. New research shows that the brain continues to mature throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. This results in a prolonged period of plasticity that makes teenagers highly vulnerable, but it may also have conferred an important evolutionary advantage.
   - Location: 2684-2686

68. Laurence Steinberg of Temple University has developed a video game to test how adolescents weigh up relative risks and rewards. The game involves taking control of a car and driving it across a virtual town as quickly as possible. Participants encounter several sets of traffic lights on the journey, some of which turn amber as they are approached. This forces the participants to make a quick decision about whether to lose time by stopping, or save time and earn points by speeding up and driving straight through. Steinberg has found that when teenagers play the game alone, they risk driving through the lights about as frequently as adults. When a friend is watching them play the game, however, they run through the traffic lights roughly twice as often. This demonstrates the influence that peers have on teenage behaviour – teenagers experience approval by their peers as being highly rewarding, and are therefore more willing to take risks in order to gain it.

69. Prolonged exposure to stress during early childhood and adolescence has negative and long-lasting effects on the brain and behaviour. Early life stress disrupts the development of brain circuits and impacts negatively on mental function, increasing the risk of mental illness later in life. Some of these effects are probably reversible, however, and this has important implications for child-rearing and social policy.

70. Positive stress occurs as a result of a brief stressful experience, such as a child’s first day at nursery. This leads to an acute response involving increased heart rate and altered hormone levels, and can be coped with easily. Tolerable stress also occurs following experiences such as divorce or death of a loved one, and children can overcome this with the help of a caring adult. Toxic stress follows adverse events that last for days, weeks or months, and can cause long-lasting changes to the brain.

71. SuperAgers American researchers recently identified a small group of people in their 80s whose brains appear to be resistant to the effects of ageing. In lab tests involving memorizing lists of words, these individuals – named ‘SuperAgers’ by the researchers – outperformed other healthy people of a similar age and matched the performance of healthy adults aged between 50 and 65. Structural MRI scans further revealed that their brains do not undergo the deterioration normally associated with ageing. Their neocortices were just as thick as those of the younger adults, and the overall volume of their brains was about the same, too. One region in particular – the anterior cingulate gyrus – was even thicker in the SuperAgers than in the healthy younger adults. These findings show that age-related brain deterioration and mental decline are not inevitable. Further studies of these individuals may provide clues about how to prevent or reduce the impairments in mental faculties normally associated with ageing.

72. Ageing typically involves a slowdown in various mental abilities, the best studied of which is memory. Older people often experience lapses in episodic memory, forgetting details such as where they parked their car, and this may be due to deficits in encoding, storage or retrieval of memories. In laboratory tests, they show significant impairments in tasks that involve switching their attention rapidly from one thing to another, and in working-memory tasks involving storing and manipulating information for short periods of time.

73. On the other hand, older people usually do not experience problems with semantic (conceptual) memory, and their knowledge of the world often exceeds that of younger adults. It has also been reported that older adults have more empathy, and enjoy a higher level of emotional well-being, than younger people.

74. For much of the past 100 years, it was widely believed that the adult brain does not produce new cells. Such thinking began to change in the 1960s, with studies showing that some species of mammals do generate new brain cells throughout adulthood. The jury is still out, however, on whether this holds true for the human brain.

79. The nucleus of every cell in your body contains more than a metre (3ft) of DNA, packaged into 26 pairs of chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of one long double-stranded DNA molecule, which contains the information for synthesizing thousands of different cellular proteins. DNA is tightly coiled around barrel-shaped proteins called histones, producing a beads-on-a-string structure. This is coiled into helical fibres with a diameter of 30 nanometres (billionths of a metre), and these fibres are in turn organized into loops. The combination of DNA and proteins inside a chromosome is referred to as chromatin. Chromosomes undergo continuous structural changes that regulate gene activity. Chromatin unzips at specific locations so that the molecular machinery that synthesizes proteins can gain access to the genetic information, then it closes up again once the gene is no longer active. These changes are controlled by epigenetic mechanisms, which ‘mark’ the chromosomes. Collectively, these marks constitute the epigenome.

80. Default mode The wandering mind may provide fresh insights into brain function. Switching off from the outside world and entering the mental world of daydreams and imagination activates a set of brain regions called the default mode network, which is deactivated during demanding tasks. This network, which is disrupted in various diseases, may support the brain’s core functions.

81. The brain is often thought of as an input/output system, processing information from the outside to generate an appropriate behavioural response, and most brain-scanning studies examine which areas become active, or ‘light up’, during a particular action or perception. It is a hungry organ that consumes about 20 per cent of the body’s energy, despite accounting for just 2 per cent of its mass – yet we’ve known, since the 1950s, that its metabolic activity changes very little when it is actively engaged in performing a task.

82. The DMN comprises about half a dozen interconnected brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobe, which generate oscillating activity patterns with a frequency of 0.1 Hz (one cycle every ten seconds) or less. It includes the medial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in ‘theory of mind’, or making inferences about the intentions of others; the medial temporal lobe, which plays a critical role in memory; and the posterior cingulate gyrus, which, among other things, integrates activity of the frontal and temporal lobes. The DMN is negatively correlated with tasks involving paying attention to external stimuli. In other words, it becomes less active during tasks that involve focusing on the outside world, and more active when we turn our thoughts inwards.

83. Individual neurons exhibit spontaneous, rhythmic patterns of electrical activity in the form of action potentials (See also The nervous impulse), and cells located in the same part of the brain form nuclei, or clusters, that send their axons to the same target brain region. Such organization is laid down during brain development to form functional networks with extremely precise neural pathways. Cells within these pathways are connected to each other not only by chemical synapses, but also by electrical synapses, or gap junctions, which enable them to coordinate their activity and fire simultaneously.

84. The synchronized bursts of electrical activity generated by large neuronal populations containing millions of cells are known as brain waves, and can be detected from outside the skull using two brain-imaging techniques called electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Ever since their discovery in the late 1920s (see box below), we’ve known that brain waves have distinct patterns, but only in recent years have we begun to appreciate the significance of these patterns for information processing.

85. Prediction error The brain is constantly dealing with uncertainty. It learns models of the outside world based on limited – and often ambiguous – information, and uses pre-existing knowledge to make predictions about the causes of sensory experience. Our perceptions are the brain’s ‘best guess’, as it minimizes the discrepancy between its predictions and actual outcomes to refine its world model.

86. The strongest criticisms of the technique are levelled at how the data are interpreted. Researchers often make what are referred to as ‘reverse inferences’ when interpreting fMRI data. Imagine a hypothetical fMRI study showing that brain area A is activated during task X. The researchers look at earlier studies and find that the same area is also active during mental process Y. They therefore conclude that task X relies on mental process Y. Unfortunately, although it seems attractive, the logic behind this reasoning is flawed – even if area A consistently lights up during task X, we cannot conclude that task X is always being performed when we see activity in area A. Reverse inference is related to the misleading and simplistic idea that a single part of the brain is responsible for a particular behaviour. The brain is a complex network of hundreds of discrete, specialized areas, but none of these acts on its own, and all behaviours are the result of the cooperative activity of many areas. Thus, brain area A, which was activated in our hypothetical fMRI study, is probably involved in other mental processes and is also likely be activated during other tasks. These criticisms have led some neuroscientists to refer disparagingly to fMRI as ‘blobology’, and to liken the method to phrenology, the 19th-century pseudoscience that aimed to relate mental functions with the shape of the skull.

87. Recent advances have led to the development of devices that can read the brain’s electrical activity and translate it into signals which control external machinery. These brain–computer interfaces are commercially available in the gaming industry, and could enable people with spinal cord injuries to control prosthetic limbs or regain control of paralysed limbs.

88. Bartlett concluded that memory is reconstructive, not reproductive, in nature. Our memories of events are tainted by our own biases and expectations, which cause errors to creep in to our recollections. Thus, we do not remember events exactly as they occurred; rather, our memories are subtly distorted to fit in to our existing knowledge. Other researchers have since confirmed Bartlett’s findings. His work has also been extended to show that memories can easily be manipulated, both inadvertently and deliberately, and that people can be made to believe that completely false memories are actually real (see Mental time travel).

At a homeopathic dilution of 200C (you can buy much higher dilutions from any homeopathic supplier) the treating substance is diluted more than the total number of atoms in the universe, and by an enormously huge margin. To look at it another way, the universe contains about 3 x 1080 cubic metres of storage space (ideal for starting a family): if it was filled with water, and one molecule of active ingredient, this would make for a rather paltry 55C dilution.

5. It is very common for researchers to research the things which interest them, in all areas of medicine; but they can be interested in quite different things from patients. One study actually thought to ask people with osteoarthritis of the knee what kind of research they wanted to be carried out, and the responses were fascinating: they wanted rigorous real-world evaluations of the benefits from physiotherapy and surgery, from educational and coping strategy interventions, and other pragmatic things. They didn’t want yet another trial comparing one pill with another, or with placebo.

6. The philosopher Professor Harry Frankfurt of Princeton University discusses this issue at length in his classic 1986 essay ‘On Bullshit’. Under his model, ‘bullshit’ is a form of falsehood distinct from lying: the liar knows and cares about the truth, but deliberately sets out to mislead; the truth-speaker knows the truth and is trying to give it to us; the bullshitter, meanwhile, does not care about the truth, and is simply trying to impress us:

7. That solution is a process called ‘systematic review’. Instead of just mooching around online and picking out your favourite papers to back up your prejudices and help you sell a product, in a systematic review you have an explicit search strategy for seeking out data (openly described in your paper, even including the search terms you used on databases of research papers), you tabulate the characteristics of each study you find, you measure—ideally blind to the results—the methodological quality of each one (to see how much of a ‘fair test’ it is), you compare alternatives, and then finally you give a critical, weighted summary. This is what the Cochrane Collaboration does on all the healthcare topics that it can find. It even invites people to submit new clinical questions that need an answer. This careful sifting of information has revealed huge gaps in knowledge, it has revealed that ‘best practices’ were sometimes murderously flawed, and simply by sifting methodically through pre-existing data, it has saved more lives than you could possibly imagine.

8. The paediatrician Dr Benjamin Spock wrote a record-breaking best-seller called Baby and Child Care, first published in 1946, which was hugely influential and largely sensible. In it, he confidently recommended that babies should sleep on their tummies. Dr Spock had little to go on, but we now know that this advice is wrong, and the apparently trivial suggestion contained in his book, which was so widely read and followed, has led to thousands, and perhaps even tens of thousands, of avoidable cot deaths. The more people are listening to you, the greater the effects of a small error can be.

11. The single cheap solution that will solve all of the problems in the entire world What’s truly extraordinary is that almost all of these problems—the suppression of negative results, data dredging, hiding unhelpful data, and more—could largely be solved with one very simple intervention that would cost almost nothing: a clinical trials register, public, open, and properly enforced. This is how it would work. You’re a drug company. Before you even start your study, you publish the ‘protocol’ for it, the methods section of the paper, somewhere public. This means that everyone can see what you’re going to do in your trial, what you’re going to measure, how, in how many people, and so on, before you start. The problems of publication bias, duplicate publication and hidden data on side-effects—which all cause unnecessary death and suffering—would be eradicated overnight, in one fell swoop. If you registered a trial, and conducted it, but it didn’t appear in the literature, it would stick out like a sore thumb. Everyone, basically, would assume you had something to hide, because you probably would. There are trials registers at present, but they are a mess.

Yet the media remain obsessed with ‘new breakthroughs’.

13. What can this kind of paper tell you about a link between something as common as MMR, and something as common as autism? Basically nothing, either way. It was a collection of twelve clinical anecdotes, a type of paper called a ‘case series’—and a case series, by design, wouldn’t demonstrate such a relationship between an exposure and an outcome with any force. It did not take some children who were given MMR and some children who weren’t, and then compare the rates of autism between the two groups (this would have been a ‘cohort study’). It did not take some children with autism, and some children without autism, and then compare the rates of vaccination between the two groups (this would have been a ‘case-control study’).

When your parents were young they could fix their own car, and understand the science behind most of the everyday technology they encountered, but this is no longer the case.

In 2008 Gary Schwitzer, an ex-journalist who now works on quantitative studies of the media, published an analysis of five hundred health articles covering treatments from mainstream newspapers in the US. Only 35 per cent of stories were rated satisfactory for whether the journalist had ‘discussed the study methodology and the quality of the evidence’ (because in the media, as we have seen repeatedly in this book, science is about absolute truth statements from arbitrary authority figures in white coats, rather than clear descriptions of studies, and the reasons why people draw conclusions from them). Only 28 per cent adequately covered benefits, and only 33 per cent adequately covered harms. Articles routinely failed to give any useful quantitative information in absolute terms, preferring unhelpful eye-catchers like ‘50 per cent higher’ instead.

## Believing: The Neuroscience of Fantasies, Fears, and Convictions
**Author:** Michael McGuire

### Highlights (65)

1. Belief is a state or a habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing. It is to accept as true, genuine, or real. It is to have a firm conviction as to the goodness, efficacy, or ability of something.
   - Location: 220-222
   - Page: 15

2. A belief divide is an individual’s perceived distance between a belief and his assessment of evidence related to the belief.
   - Location: 242-242
   - Page: 16

3. Divides may be narrow or wide or somewhere in between. It is the believer’s assessment of divides, not what others perceive as divides,
   - Location: 242-243
   - Page: 16

4. Divides that others perceive frequently differ from those of believers. For example, there is a small divide separating belief and available evidence for those who are convinced of climate change, while the divide is wide for those who find the available evidence unconvincing. Or take the existent of God. For some believers, the Bible is irrefutable evidence of God’s existence and the divide is narrow. For nonbelievers, the Bible, whatever it is, isn’t a source of compelling evidence about the existence of God and the divide is wide.
   - Location: 244-247
   - Page: 16

5. The presence of a narrow divide doesn’t mean that a belief is true, however. Divides may be narrow due to the selective interpretation of evidence or its misinterpretation.
   - Location: 250-251
   - Page: 17

6. BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS AND BELIEF There are beliefs that are inseparable from behavior expectations. Individuals, families, social groups, tribes, and clans—groups of all types—organize their affairs around convictions ranging from the mundane to the supernatural. They are the source of rules, rituals, and expected social behavior often for which there are no formal laws. How to queue in line at a movie or in a grocery store, when and how to pay homage to one’s parents, standing to sing a national anthem or tribal chant, when and how to repay favors, what should and shouldn’t be eaten, how to behave at funerals, and when and with whom certain topics can be discussed—all are examples. Those who don’t comply invite criticism and, at times, ostracism.

7. In 2011, Shermer’s third book on belief appeared, The Believing Brain: From Ghosts to Politics and Conspiracies—How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths.6 Three themes are at the heart of his analysis of belief. The first is patternicity: the brain has evolved to perceive patterns even in response to random stimuli. The second is agenticity: the brain is strongly biased toward attributing intentional action as the cause of events. And third, we form beliefs first and then look for supporting evidence.

8. The year 2011 also saw the publication of Thinking Fast and Slow7 by Nobel Prize recipient Daniel Kahneman. For Kahneman, two systems serve as the backbone of his book and characterize the ways our brain handles information. System 1 is intuition, our fast, automatic, and unconscious system that makes instant judgments and leads to instant beliefs and action. System 2 is our far slower analytic system—think “rational” or “logical”—that reasons and often corrects judgments made by system 1. He stops short of saying that the brain is fundamentally irrational, but it is hard not to draw this conclusion from his examples. Kahneman’s two systems map much of what we experience, although as some authors have pointed out there is no reason to assume that there are only two systems.8 We frequently make instantaneous judgments and develop beliefs based on minimal or questionable evidence. We also think things through and revise our instantaneous judgments. But as I will discuss presently, these systems are far from independent or separate. Rather, they are closely intertwined and highly susceptible to each other’s influence.

9. It is now a century and a half since the Origin arrived at the bookstores in London. Recent studies show that anywhere from 24 to 85 percent of adults in different cultures believe in evolution and its primary mechanism of change, natural selection. Iceland has the highest percentage, which is greater than 80 percent, while Turkey has the lowest with 24 percent.

10. science has developed and applies a methodology that systematically reduces the probability of connecting explanations with irrelevant evidence. The method narrows divides when experimental findings are repeatedly confirmed. It widens divides when they are not. Over time, things-in-themselves can slowly change from unknowables to partial knowables. The progressive specification of the human genetic system can be characterized this way.4 True, there are limits to what scientists can know. Yet these limits don’t invalidate scientific methodology, its findings and explanations, and the predictions its explanations make possible.

11. Evidence is information that can be used to justify or nullify a belief.
   - Location: 961-962
   - Page: 63

12. Multiple types of evidence exist. Three are of interest here: direct, indirect, and circumstantial. As the term is used here, direct evidence is the evidence of personal experience. It ranges from simple observations—a faucet is leaking—to reviewing the findings of a complex experiment, to highly stressful situations involving the full range of emotional and cognitive responses experienced when, for example, one is a passenger on an airplane in mechanical distress.

13. the subject’s failure to recognize the gorilla is due to the “illusion of attention”: “We experience far less of our visual worlds than we think we do.”9 Their interpretation is consistent with a key theme of this book: direct evidence may be incomplete or misperceived. It follows that beliefs that build from direct evidence can be wrong.
   - Location: 1023-1026
   - Page: 67

14. Preferences are frequently observed between beliefs that people develop from direct evidence and those in which the source is a third person or authority. If religious beliefs are exempted, people are far more likely to favor beliefs based on direct evidence than those of a third party.10 We prefer to believe our own beliefs and divides rather than those of others. Likely this explains in part why people are resistant to changing their beliefs.
   - Location: 1027-1031
   - Page: 67

15. INDIRECT EVIDENCE If direct evidence is about personal experience, indirect evidence is about information from secondary sources. Books, newspapers, TV, radio, the Internet, and gossip are examples.
   - Location: 1031-1033
   - Page: 68

16. Surprisingly, we often perceive indirect evidence as crisper than direct evidence. Crispness may enhance its believability and authority. Statements made on radio, on TV, in newspapers, or by next-door neighbors often are crafted such that conflicting evidence or discordant views go unmentioned; in effect, evidence that could influence divides or disconfirm what is reported is left unstated or selectively interpreted.
   - Location: 1036-1039
   - Page: 68

17. There is also circumstantial evidence. This consists of packages of direct and indirect evidence that tend to “prove” an event or a fact by identifying other events or circumstances that afford a basis for believing in the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or fact. At times, it is acceptable in courts. (It is a well-established staple of mystery novels.)
   - Location: 1049-1052
   - Page: 69

18. intuition: a brain information-processing system that often provides ready insight and explanation and may be associated with near-instant action. Intuitive primacy is a term often used to refer to this system. It has been described as “human emotions” and “gut feelings” that drive judgments and action.22 Intuition operates “outside” awareness. It can be automatic, quick, and often highly efficient, as in situations in which one engages in on-the-spot actions. It is at work when one is walking along a crowded street that requires the rapid integration of complex information and action to avoid contact with other pedestrians. Intuition also asserts itself in decision making, problem solving, and belief creation, even when a more rational approach is the better choice. For example, college students are given the following problem: “A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?” Approximately 50 percent of students say the ball costs ten cents. The correct answer is five cents. But for many students, “ten cents feels right,” they argue. Further, it is far from clear if anyone is exempt from moments of intuitive primacy or its errors. Studies suggest that people who are intuitive and in a good mood will believe almost anything.23 This point apparently applies even among those whose professions profess the importance of rational thinking; for example, 95 percent of college professors believe that the quality of their work is superior to that of colleagues working in the same field. Ninety-five percent can’t be inference. It must be intuition.

19. One upshot of studies of belief is that the antiquated notion that knowledge arises directly from evidence has been jettisoned and superseded by a complex paradigm in which the emotional and cognitive components of belief, experience, and information from external sources interact with a bias favoring molding reality to conform to one’s beliefs. In extreme instances, “beliefs tend to sustain themselves even despite the total discrediting of evidence that produced the belief.”5

22. the modern scientific method is barely four and a half centuries old. The 1550 publication of Copernicus’s description of how the Earth and other planets in the solar system revolve around the Sun is usually taken as its inception date.8 Why the modern method took so long to develop is an interesting question in its own right. Clearly there were many very competent scientists as far back as Babylonian times (circa 1750 BCE) and no doubt well before.9 Part of the answer is found in the modus operandi of scientists prior to 1550. They focused primarily on proving their ideas. This they did with the information they had, often with ingenious reasoning, but without a well-articulated or generally accepted methodology to systematically assess their explanations and evidence.
   - Location: 1461-1467
   - Page: 96

23. during the sixteenth century, the makings of a critical methodological shift began to emerge: science would gradually attempt to restructure its methodology and research strategy to that of disproving ideas and hypotheses rather than proving them. On first pass, a change in a single word—proving to disproving—seems trivial. There were clear implications however; the methods and evaluations of empirical research were about to undergo a significant alteration, albeit slowly. The upshot of the shift was that empirical science adopted rules and procedures that ratcheted up the precision requirements for evidence and standardized research methods while simultaneously introducing a healthy dose of skepticism about science and its explanations. Evidence had to be accurately described and measured. Interpretations had to specify as precisely as possible how they explained evidence. Repeated high-quality experiments that consistently failed to disprove hypotheses were essential for scientists to recognize and alter divides.
   - Location: 1468-1476
   - Page: 96

24. the emerging methodology identified a fundamental limitation of scientific inquiry: adopting the disproving strategy meant that nothing could ever be viewed as proved for certain.
   - Location: 1477-1478
   - Page: 97

25. recall that divide references how individuals—not others—perceive the distance between a belief and the evidence they take as justifying the belief to be true. Divides may be narrow, wide, somewhere in between, or indeterminate. A narrow divide is present when a person perceives that a belief is strongly supported by evidence. A wide divide is present when a person perceives that there is no evidence supporting a belief. When a divide is indeterminate, a perceiver is uncertain if there is evidence that might justify a belief.

26. What we experience is disconnected from the body. Only at moments when a belief is associated with an emotion such as happiness, excitement, anxiety, fear, despair, disgust, or pain or when we are focusing on some part of our body is there an appreciation of the body’s presence.

28. how to characterize the brain. Anatomically, it includes the tissue within the skull and nerve extensions throughout the body. Operationally, it may be necessary to add information from the environment, at least during periods of wakefulness. Conceived of as an operating system, the brain includes brain tissue, nerves throughout the body, and information from a variety of sources, including the environment. There appears to be little difference between a response associated with the pain of a stubbed toe or the irritation that accompanies the recognition that one’s car has a flat tire. It follows that the exclusion of environmental information from efforts to explain how the brain works invites serious review.

29. Two quotations from neurologist Robert Burton’s 2008 book, On Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You Are Not, provide a convenient point of departure: The message at the heart of this book is that the feelings of knowing, correctness, conviction, and certainty aren’t deliberate conclusions and conscious choices. They are mental sensations that happen to us.1 . . . To be effective powerful rewards, some of these sensations such as the feeling of knowing and the feeling of conviction must feel like conscious and deliberate conclusions. As a result, the brain has developed a constellation of mental sensations that feel like thoughts but aren’t.2 [Burton’s italics]

30. Information has many definitions and ways in which it is conceived.29 The one adopted here is as follows: information = energy that alters brain activity. It could be defined in terms of other measurable features as it is in information theory.30 Only the energy definition is used here. It is essentially synonymous with the usual meaning of stimulus: something that rouses or incites to activity.

33. EVOLVED BRAIN SYSTEMS Belief and divides are products of brain systems that have been undergoing change and refinement for millions of years. A similar history is likely for imagining, mirroring (replicating the brain activities of others), Theory of mind (reading others’ brain states), attributing (assigning attributes to persons and events), and triggering (events initiate specific brain states). Alone or in combinations, they are in part responsible for beliefs and divides.
   - Location: 2410-2414
   - Page: 158

34. Imagining is an act of forming a mental image of what is not actually present or as experiencing something never before experienced. Described another way, it is an act of the brain associated with awareness of what is not currently sensed.1 Scholarly writings distinguish between imagining and belief. What is imagined is not thought to initiate action, while belief often is assumed to do so.2 On close evaluation, this distinction seldom holds up. Imaginings resemble beliefs in several ways.
   - Location: 2425-2430
   - Page: 159

35. Following the emergence of imaginings, a likely next step was that some imaginings became beliefs and were associated with predictions. As mentioned, this may have occurred in response to natural occurrences, such as an eclipse. But beliefs were also likely to have developed in association with less dramatic events. Eating an unfamiliar root or an unfamiliar part of an animal, if followed by serious indigestion, would lead to connecting the two events and the belief that one caused the other. So too for excessive fatigue following a hard day’s work or the scratch of a thorn followed by a painful infection. Such connections are often highly predictive, narrow divides, and are associated with action.

36. Ambiguity refers to doubt about explanations of states or events that may be inexplicable or subject to several interpretations. Strange and unexpected behavior by close friends and trying to fathom the causes of complex social events, such as unpredicted population uprisings, are examples. Uncertainty refers to the absence of a clearly defined state or event.

37. Uncertainty and ambiguity are associated with aversive changes in specific brain chemicals that have undesirable effects.24 Further, fMRI-identified signatures in the brain are known to be present and different types of ambiguity activate over two dozen areas in the brain.

38. Scholars in disciplines ranging from philosophy to psychology agree that believing that we can truly know the brain states of others is an illusion.1 The best we can do is make guesses, draw inferences, and engage in post hoc constructions. This holds even when others “reveal all” about themselves. Yet often we are convinced otherwise. We do believe we know other’s mental states. Actions associated with such beliefs often follow.

39. This chapter focuses on three postulated brain systems: (1) Theory of mind, which deals with how individuals surmise the brain states of themselves and others, (2) mirroring, which explains the effects of other’s behavior on the brains of observers, and (3) attribution, which involves assigning attributes to oneself and to others and explaining behavior, natural events, and physical systems. Again, I offer some words of caution. With the exception of mirroring, which has a scientific basis, Theory of mind and attributing are concepts that are difficult to discretely separate let alone precisely measure. They often seem to blend together, which may be due to the sharing of parts of a common operational anatomy in the brain.

40. Theory of mind refers to the capacity to surmise mind states. “Mind reading” is the usual term when we surmise the mind states of others. “Self-reflection” is the usual term when we focus on ourselves.
   - Location: 2622-2624
   - Page: 171

41. Given the monistic view of the brain adopted here and the many often contradictory uses of the word mind, the time is ripe for a change in terminology: Theory of brain, rather than Theory of mind, and brain reading, rather than mind reading, will be used from here on.
   - Location: 2626-2628

42. No one has suggested that mirroring is 100 percent accurate. Nor is it assumed to work the same way with everyone.23 Childhood experiences may sensitize the brain to particular behavior by others. Further, the process is not easily unlearned or constrained. Exercising constraint is one of the tasks facing young medical personnel who must learn to remain professionally focused when viewing individuals who have been severely damaged physically or who are in great emotional distress.
   - Location: 2722-2726
   - Page: 178

43. Are there similarities between brain reading and mirroring? Yes. Both involve the processing of external information. There are also differences. The information processed by mirror neurons may be limited to moments during which observations occur. In principle brain reading can occur separately from observations as during moments in which information that has already been acquired is developed into representations.
   - Location: 2730-2733
   - Page: 179

44. Attribution is one of the brain’s systems for endowing attributes and explaining the behavior of oneself, others, and events.26 It can be added to the list of mostly innate brain capacities, such as breathing and brain reading, which operate without perceived intent. At times it has been referred to as “agenticity.”
   - Location: 2765-2768
   - Page: 181

45. Attributions are about assigning properties or causal inferences about why and how actions or events occur. Often beliefs and divides are in place when this happens. For example, “He quit his job because he hated his boss.” “He converted to Catholicism to marry Jane.” “The roof collapsed because of the weight of the snow.”

46. personal stories have no life of their own unless they are told again and again.7 They are highly vulnerable to extinction. As an example, take the fate of the stories you heard from your grandparents when you were young. As an adult, some may be recalled and told to your children. Very likely, fewer will be heard by your grandchildren. Like languages that become extinct and thereby erode knowledge, so too for stories that are no longer told.8 While this may seem an obvious point, it has troubling implications: when stories become extinct, part of the brain’s library of its owner’s personal history and culture is lost. There is a further factor that contributes to extinction. Personal stories are often filled with a teller’s emotions. Memories of emotions tend to fade and lose their valence while cognitive details tend to have a longer life. Often a listener can recall many of the details of another’s story but less of the teller’s or his own emotions when a story was told.
   - Location: 2876-2884
   - Page: 188

47. the process of turning an experience into narrative assures that the narrative will differ from experience no matter how serious a storyteller’s efforts to communicate accurately.14 Writers, perhaps because of the relatively slow pace of writing compared to speaking, are particularly sensitive to this point. Emerson, Melville, Eliot, Joyce, Proust, Lawrence, and Borges all struggled to overcome translation obstacles but never did so to their full satisfaction.
   - Location: 2905-2909
   - Page: 190

48. The other half of storytelling is that a listener must interpret what he has heard. Understanding a storyteller’s intended interpretation is contingent on both the teller and a listener sharing similar views.

49. In the most general sense, models are anything used to represent something else. They may be likened to explanations, formulas, archetypes, or templates about how the experienced and supernatural worlds work. Unlike many stories, models often are free of emotion.
   - Location: 2949-2951
   - Page: 193

50. It can’t be emphasized enough how critical models are for managing the activities of daily life. There are literally hundreds of such models associated with almost everything we do: not changing the oil in your automobile will lead to motor damage, thoroughly chewing food prevents indigestion, good examination grades in high school will get one into a good college, and careful techniques produce good surgical outcomes. We believe them. As they become more precise and predictive of outcome, a reduction in computational requirements is likely coupled with their conversion to beliefs.
   - Location: 2957-2961

51. Multiple studies of child development have established that children can think before they speak,19 and they are born with the capacity to use models to deal with how the world works. For example, by sixteen months of age, they can infer the causes of failed actions:20 if a light switch is flipped and the light doesn’t go on, it could be due to selecting the wrong switch or a broken bulb. Children can figure out the most likely option. They also have concepts of property rights21 and can grasp abstract geometric principles despite the absence of math training.22 They apply cause-and-effect models in their interpretations of events that are closely related in time, such as noise from the kitchen at dusk is due to preparation for dinner. In short, children enter the world with strong predispositions to process information in specific ways.

52. Triggering occurs when either external or internal information (stimuli) initiates brain activity and specific states of awareness. It is a special case of the extended mind hypothesis. It is so commonplace and frequent that we rarely notice that it is occurring. It has an interesting if not profound implication however: it’s not quite that we are walking around the world as “freethinkers” and “impassionate observers”; rather, to a significant degree, what we experience in awareness is determined by the environment in which we find ourselves.

53. INTRANSIGENT BELIEFS Resistance to change is the default state of beliefs in which people are emotionally and cognitively invested. Intransigent beliefs are preeminent examples. To those who adopt them, they convincingly explain what they believe. Ambiguity and uncertainty are reduced significantly, and pleasurable physiologic and psychological states are usually present. Once established, they require minimal energy expenditure by the brain. Their divides are narrow. Those harboring such beliefs assert them with conviction and insist that they are buttressed by confirming evidence or authority. Alternative beliefs and evidence are disregarded or rejected usually via negative attributions. Those committed to alternative beliefs represent a dangerous opposition. It is the refutation of alternative beliefs and evidence combined with the identification of those who harbor such beliefs or evidence as enemies that are signature features of intransigent beliefs. Belief perseverance is a term often used to describe intransigence. It refers to retaining a belief in circumstances in which there are equally or more compelling beliefs or clear evidence that is at odds with a belief to which a person or a group is committed.2 Deeply held political ideologies qualify.

54. Indoctrination amounts to teaching others to respond in predictable ways to specific triggers—that is, it’s a form of brain control. The process can be distinguished from liberal education, where questioning what is taught is acceptable and encouraged.
   - Location: 3269-3271
   - Page: 214

55. That indoctrination works as well as it does is not surprising. The brain is prepared to participate in the process. There are brain substrates of long-term-memory conformity that are responsive to social manipulation and have an identifiable fMRI brain signature.4 They reveal a strong tendency of memory to conform to group recollections independent of the accuracy of what is recalled. When carried out successfully, those who are indoctrinated embrace the view that their beliefs are superior to those of others, particularly those of possible distracters. The net effect is that doctrines serve as blinders to alternative views.

56. Milder forms of Islam are often imagined to be tolerant of other ideologies. But in the estimate of a number of scholars, this is largely myth based on wishful thinking.11 Perhaps this is why Chancellor Angela Merkel has recently noted that Germany’s decade-long attempt to establish a civil multiculturalism in a country that is predominantly Christian with secular-based laws has failed.12

57. IMAGININGS THAT BECOME BELIEFS There are over 4,200 currently identifiable different faith groups or religions. There are over 2,000 Christian groups each harboring identifiably different beliefs. There are over 1,000 known political-ideological beliefs. There are millions of people who believe in ghosts, haunted houses, and conspiracy theories. Add to these numbers the thousands if not millions of private beliefs that are not recorded and often not shared with others. Many of these are intransigent. Very likely, many have their origins in imaginings, particularly those for which there is no foolproof disconfirming evidence.

58. we are born to believe, the brain is prepared to believe, people overvalue their beliefs, beliefs are associated with self-righteousness, pleasure, and reward, the brain is biased in favor of divide reduction, the brain has numerous systems that facilitate belief development and perpetuation, divide distance does not predict the strength or believability of belief, we see what we believe, emotions often determine what is believed, beliefs reduce ambiguity and uncertainty, and beliefs conserve brain energy, then we are endowed with a brain that will favor belief creation and disconfirmation failure and is one step ahead of consciousness.

59. Still, on balance, a “dumbing down” of understanding is the highly likely consequence of overload. The greater the amount of available information, the less it’s susceptible to in-depth analysis and the greater the superficiality of its interpretation.
   - Location: 3531-3533
   - Page: 231

60. It is as if, as a species, we are helpless to address these issues successfully. Intransigent beliefs, information overload, and belief fragmentation are three of the reasons why. The time-compact present is a fourth.

61. There is a vaudeville act that goes something like this: The stage is dark except for a streetlight that illuminates an area a few feet from its base. A man is searching for something in the light. A policeman arrives and asks, “What are you looking for?” “My keys,” the man replies. The policeman joins in the search for several minutes but fails to find the keys. Frustrated, he turns to the man, points to the lighted area and asks, “Are you sure you lost your keys there?” “Not there,” replies the man. “Where then?” asks the policeman. The man points to the dark. “Then why are you searching here?” asks the policeman. “The light’s better,” replies the man.

62. Education is often proposed as a solution to the perceived ills of society. Thus it is not surprising that recently there has been an increased call for the teaching of science and mathematics at all levels of education.1 These well-intended recommendations are based on the belief and hope that science and math education will transform ways of thinking and, among other things, significantly reduce the prevalence of unfounded and intransigent beliefs and their consequences.2 This hope is closer to an illusion than reality, however. There is a limited number of beliefs that science and math can address. Most of the world runs most of the time on beliefs that science can’t address. They reside in the dark, not in the light that science might shed.
   - Location: 3636-3642
   - Page: 238

63. First, be skeptical about everything you and others believe—this book is no exception. There is nothing in the dark about this suggestion. It has been around since the Enlightenment. At times, skepticism is easy, as in instances when others express beliefs with which one disagrees. But when it comes to our own beliefs, skepticism can be very hard. The brain has assured that.
   - Location: 3643-3646
   - Page: 238

64. Second, intensify the teaching of a liberal education—that is, an education that introduces students to different models, teaches strong analytic skills, exposes them to how the brain works, and respects both the past and the uncertainty of the future. Currently this suggestion is in the dark. Why this type of education? Because models, analytic skills, knowledge of the past, and details about how the brain works are the best safeguards we have to offset the effects of the time-compact present, beliefs without supporting evidence, intransigent beliefs, and belief disconfirmation failure.
   - Location: 3646-3650
   - Page: 238

65. Third, remember that belief representations in the unperceived brain are composed of networks of information created from a variety of internal and external sources and systems, including triggering, brain reading, imaginings, stories, models, direct and indirect evidence, inferences, and far more. The brain is prepared for belief creation and acceptance. It is biased in favor of divide reduction. It prefers beliefs that are pleasurable and rewarding to those that are unpleasant and aversive. It is composed of systems that organize and process information in ways over which we have minimal influence. Evidence has only limited efficacy in altering beliefs. These many factors assure that for the foreseeable future there will be a near-endless number of beliefs and divides. Intransigent beliefs will contribute prominently to this number.

## The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy From Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography
**Author:** Simon Singh

### Highlights (25)

1. Secret communication achieved by hiding the existence of a message is known as steganography, derived from the Greek words steganos, meaning “covered,” and graphein, meaning “to write.”
   - Location: 224-225
   - Page: 15

2. In fact, an even simpler key is possible if the sender is prepared to accept a slight reduction in the number of potential keys. Instead of randomly rearranging the plain alphabet to achieve the cipher alphabet, the sender chooses a keyword or keyphrase. For example, to use JULIUS CAESAR as a keyphrase, begin by removing any spaces and repeated letters (JULISCAER), and then use this as the beginning of the jumbled cipher alphabet. The remainder of the cipher alphabet is merely the remaining letters of the alphabet, in their correct order, starting where the keyphrase ends. Hence, the cipher alphabet would read as follows.

3. alphabet, b might be replaced by +, and so on. The monoalphabetic substitution cipher is the general name given to any substitution cipher in which the cipher alphabet consists of either letters or symbols, or a mix of both. All
   - Location: 386-387
   - Page: 26

4. Al-Kindī’s technique, known as frequency analysis, shows that it is unnecessary to check each of the billions of potential keys. Instead, it is possible to reveal the contents of a scrambled message simply by analyzing the frequency of the characters in the ciphertext.
   - Location: 434-435
   - Page: 29

5. Focusing on words with only one letter is a standard cryptanalytic trick, and I have included it among a list of cryptanalytic tips in Appendix B. This particular trick works only because this ciphertext still has spaces between the words. Often, a cryptographer will remove all the spaces to make it harder for an enemy interceptor to unscramble the message.
   - Location: 526-528
   - Page: 35

6. One of the simplest improvements to the security of the monoalphabetic substitution cipher was the introduction of nulls, symbols or letters that were not substitutes for actual letters, merely blanks that represented nothing.
   - Location: 633-635
   - Page: 42

7. An equally simple development was that cryptographers would sometimes deliberately misspell words before encrypting the message.
   - Location: 638-639
   - Page: 42

8. it is also possible to have substitution at a much higher level, whereby each word is represented by another word or symbol—this would be a code.
   - Location: 644-645
   - Page: 42

9. Technically, a code is defined as substitution at the level of words or phrases, whereas a cipher is defined as substitution at the level of letters. Hence the term encipher means to scramble a message using a cipher, while encode means to scramble a message using a code. Similarly, the term decipher applies to unscrambling an enciphered message, and decode to unscrambling an encoded message. The terms encrypt and decrypt are more general, and cover scrambling and unscrambling with respect to both codes and ciphers.
   - Location: 646-650
   - Page: 43

10. At the time, all substitution ciphers required a single cipher alphabet for encrypting each message. However, Alberti proposed using two or more cipher alphabets, switching between them during encipherment, thereby confusing potential cryptanalysts. For example, here we have two possible cipher alphabets, and we could encrypt a message by alternating between them. To encrypt the message hello, we would encrypt the first letter according to the first cipher alphabet, so that h becomes A, but we would encrypt the second letter according to the second cipher alphabet, so that e becomes F. To encrypt the third letter we return to the first cipher alphabet, and to encrypt the fourth letter we return to the second alphabet. This means that the first l is enciphered as P, but the second l is enciphered as A. The final letter, o, is enciphered according to the first cipher alphabet and becomes D. The complete ciphertext reads AFPAD. The crucial advantage of Alberti’s system is that the same letter in the plaintext does not necessarily appear as the same letter in the ciphertext, so the repeated l in hello is enciphered differently in each case.
   - Location: 902-911
   - Page: 59

11. The strength of the Vigenère cipher lies in its using not one, but 26 distinct cipher alphabets to encrypt a message. The first step in encipherment is to draw up a so-called Vigenère square, as shown in Table 3, a plaintext alphabet followed by 26 cipher alphabets, each shifted by one letter with respect to the previous alphabet. Hence, row 1 represents a cipher alphabet with a Caesar shift of 1, which means that it could be used to implement a Caesar shift cipher in which every letter of the plaintext is replaced by the letter one place further on in the alphabet. Similarly, row 2 represents a cipher alphabet with a Caesar shift of 2, and so on. The top row of the square, in lower case, represents the plaintext letters. You could encipher each plaintext letter according to any one of the 26 cipher alphabets. For example, if cipher alphabet number 2 is used, then the letter a is enciphered as C, but if cipher alphabet number 12 is used, then a is enciphered as M.
   - Location: 923-929
   - Page: 61

12. As well as being invulnerable to frequency analysis, the Vigenère cipher has an enormous number of keys. The sender and receiver can agree on any word in the dictionary, any combination of words, or even fabricate words.

13. Sit thee down, and have no shame, Cheek by jowl, and knee by knee: What care I for any name? What for order or degree? Let me screw thee up a peg: Let me loose thy tongue with wine: Callest thou that thing a leg? Which is thinnest? thine or mine? Thou shalt not be saved by works: Thou hast been a sinner too: Ruined trunks on withered forks, Empty scarecrows, I and you! Fill the cup, and fill the can: Have a rouse before the morn: Every moment dies a man, Every moment one is born. These are verses from a poem by Alfred Tennyson entitled “The Vision of Sin.”

14. The development of the telegraph, which had driven a commercial interest in cryptography, was also responsible for generating public interest in cryptography. The public became aware of the need to protect personal messages of a highly sensitive nature, and if necessary they would use encryption, even though this took more time to send, thus adding to the cost of the telegram. Morse operators could send plain English at speeds of up to 35 words per minute because they could memorize entire phrases and transmit them in a single burst, whereas the jumble of letters that make up a ciphertext was considerably slower to transmit, because the operator had to continually refer back to the sender’s written message to check the sequence of letters.

15. Before the overhaul of the postage system in the mid-1800s, sending a letter cost about a shilling for every hundred miles, beyond the means of most people. However, newspapers could be posted free of charge, and this provided a loophole for thrifty Victorians. Instead of writing and sending letters, people began to use pinpricks to spell out a message on the front page of a newspaper. They could then send the newspaper through the post without having to pay a penny.
   - Location: 1400-1403
   - Page: 92

16. As the Great War drew to a close, Major Joseph Mauborgne, head of cryptographic research for the U.S. Army, introduced the concept of a random key-one that consisted not of a recognizable series of words, but rather a random series of letters. He advocated employing these random keys as part of a Vigenère cipher to give an unprecedented level of security. The first stage of Mauborgne’s system was to compile a thick pad consisting of hundreds of sheets of paper, each sheet bearing a unique key in the form of lines of randomly sequenced letters. There would be two copies of the pad, one for the sender and one for the receiver. To encrypt a message, the sender would apply the Vigenère cipher using the first sheet of the pad as the key.
   - Location: 1975-1980
   - Page: 129

17. Once that message has been successfully sent, received and deciphered, both the sender and the receiver destroy the sheet that acted as the key, so that it is never used again. When the next message is encrypted, the next random key in the pad is employed, which is also subsequently destroyed, and so on. Because each key is used once, and only once, this system is known as a onetime pad cipher.
   - Location: 1982-1985
   - Page: 130

18. the onetime pad cipher is not merely believed to be unbreakable, just as the Vigenère cipher was in the nineteenth century, it really is absolutely secure. The onetime pad offers a guarantee of secrecy: the Holy Grail of cryptography. At last, cryptographers had found an unbreakable system of encryption. However, the perfection of the onetime pad cipher did not end the quest for secrecy: the truth of the matter is that it was hardly ever used. Although it is perfect in theory, it is flawed in practice because the cipher suffers from two fundamental difficulties. First, there is the practical problem of making large quantities of random keys. In a single day an army might exchange hundreds of messages, each containing thousands of characters, so radio operators would require a daily supply of keys equivalent to millions of randomly arranged letters. Supplying so many random sequences of letters is an immense task.

   - Page: 131

19. Even if you could fabricate enough random keys, there is a second problem, namely the difficulty of distributing them.
   - Location: 2028-2029
   - Page: 133

20. A onetime pad is practicable only for people who need ultrasecure communication, and who can afford to meet the enormous costs of manufacturing and securely distributing the keys. For example, the hotline between the presidents of Russia and America is secured via a onetime pad cipher.
   - Location: 2037-2039
   - Page: 133

21. The cipher disk can be thought of as a “scrambler,” taking each plaintext letter and transforming it into something else. The mode of operation described so far is straightforward, and the resulting cipher is relatively trivial to break, but the cipher disk can be used in a more complicated way. Its inventor, Alberti, suggested changing the setting of the disk during the message, which in effect generates a polyalphabetic cipher instead of a monoalphabetic cipher.

In 1918, the German inventor Arthur Scherbius and his close friend Richard Ritter founded the company of Scherbius & Ritter, an innovative engineering firm that dabbled in everything from turbines to heated pillows. Scherbius was in charge of research and development, and was constantly looking for new opportunities. One of his pet projects was to replace the inadequate systems of cryptography used in the First World War by swapping pencil-and-paper ciphers with a form of encryption that exploited twentieth-century technology. Having studied electrical engineering in Hanover and Munich, he developed a piece of cryptographic machinery that was essentially an electrical version of Alberti’s cipher disk. Called Enigma, Scherbius’s invention would become the most fearsome system of encryption in history.

A quantum computer would jeopardize the stability of the world. Whichever country gets there first will have the ability to monitor the communications of its citizens, read the minds of its commercial rivals and eavesdrop on the plans of its enemies. Although it is still in its infancy, quantum computing presents a potential threat to the individual, to international business and to global security.

## The Darker the Night, the Brighter the Stars: A Neuropsychologist's Odyssey Through Consciousness
**Author:** Paul Broks

### Highlights (23)

1. Baby Harry was one of around 370,000 new human beings launched into life on planet Earth on 19 October 2011. The same day that he and his cohort were taking their first breaths and blinking at the blooming, buzzing confusion of it all, roughly 155,000 people took their last and slipped into oblivion. Entrances and exits.

2. Perception is all about attaching meaning to patterns. Our survival depends both on the ability to identify regularities in the world and to respond to irregularities. Generally, we know what to expect. We have an intuitive sense of cause and effect, and of what is probable and what is improbable.
   - Location: 954-956
   - Page: 63

3. All creative endeavors are geared toward the discovery of new patterns and connections, fresh ways of seeing the world, but sometimes the struggle for insight can be counterproductive. Epiphany (a moment of realization) has an obscure cousin in the lexicon of madness: apophany. It refers to the point at which an ordinary experience becomes the fountainhead of delusion. The newsreader says, “Good evening,” and you know at once that he is Satan himself. Your neighbor’s car catches the light and you realize that he and his fellow extraterrestrials are bent on destroying your brain with their deadly rays.

5. Placing these various forms of experience along the dimensions of autonomy (voluntary/involuntary), vividness (realistic/muted) and location (internal/external), we can differentiate imagination, ordinary dreams and imaginal reality as follows. The products of imagination are voluntary, muted and internal. For example, Carla imagines being greeted by a friend’s dog. She conjures an image of the dog with its tail wagging, but the image is pale by comparison with the sight of a real-life, tail-wagging dog. There’s no question that she has willed it into existence and that it is experienced as being located in the arena of her own conscious mind. Dream imagery, by contrast, is involuntary, and somewhat more vivid and external-feeling, such that we seem to enter into, and become enveloped by, a different world. Carla dreams that a mad dog is chasing her down the street. She didn’t deliberately construct this situation in the way that she willed the images of the encounter with the friendly dog. She had no say in being dropped into the dream scenario, and it feels to some degree real, at least real enough for her to feel fear. And yet, the experience lacks the full-blown, multisensory, 3D quality of being chased by a mad dog in real life. Nor, come to think of it, is the setting quite right. She turned a corner and somehow found herself in the street where she lived as a child. It feels unreal. Dreams do. They are dreamlike. The apparitions of sleep paralysis are vivid in their rich texture and multisensory detail (“real as real”) and externally located in a real setting that can be scanned and scrutinized as the monsters go about their evil business. Carla sees, hears and smells the gnomish old intruder. She feels the wetness of his spit and the pressure of his fingers at her throat. The monsters have autonomy in the sense that they appear to speak and act in purposeful ways beyond the control of their victims, but then so do the less real-seeming characters of ordinary dreams. It’s the killing combination of multi-sensory vividness, autonomy and appearance in a real setting that makes them so compellingly “real.” But although the experience has all the qualities of wakeful consciousness, the apparitions depart from reality because they are, despite the compelling sensory evidence, subjective experiences. No one else can see them. They don’t reflect in mirrors. They don’t go on without you when you die. Sleep paralysis hallucinations are convincing and terrifying enough, but I am going to call this the “weak version” of imaginal reality and, pushing the idea further in the direction of the Greek gods, will speculate that there might also be a “strong version.” In the weak version, the apparitions are experienced as external to the self and have a terrifying degree of apparent autonomy in the sense that they are beyond the person’s voluntary control, but they are mere hallucinations—mindless, subpersonal projections of the unconscious mind. They have autonomy insofar as they spring up of their own accord and occur alongside real perceptions (to paraphrase the definition of “hallucination” offered by the philosopher and psychopathologist Karl Jaspers) but, for all that, they are mindless and totally subjective. In the strong version of imaginal reality they go beyond this limited, mindless sense of autonomy. In the strong version they have some semblance of mind. They are in some ways extrapersonal (that is, independent of the person’s mind) rather than subpersonal, and so have a degree of objective presence. As sleep paralysis sufferers will tell you, these creatures have the shine of sentience in their eyes, the look of intelligence and malicious intent, but such reports, however compelling the perceptions on which they are based, provide no evidence at all that the monsters have purposeful minds of their own.

6. one of the functions of music was to tune the brain machinery that drives our sense of self. There was music, like Pärt’s, that worked to loosen the ego and there was music that had an opposite, consolidating, effect. Musicologists point to the collective functions of music, its use in ritual and ceremony and its contribution to the continuity and stability of cultures. Singing and dancing draw people together, synchronizing emotions, bonding the group in empathy and reflection, or in preparation for action. The power of music lies beyond language and intellect. It springs from an emotional need for communication with other human beings.

7. There is near universal agreement that consciousness is an aspect of brain function or, to be slightly more cautious, that brains are a necessary platform for consciousness even if, in themselves, they may not be entirely sufficient. The brain needs a body, and the body needs a world.

8. there is a growing body of clinical opinion that delusions should be considered not as beliefs but as knowledge claims—distinguishing “to know that” and “to believe that.” The deluded person simply “knows” such and such, rather than merely believing it. For example, I know that my name is Paul. It’s on my birth certificate, it’s what my parents always called me, what my friends know me by, and the name I give when strangers ask. On the other hand, I merely believe that my new neighbor is called David. That’s what another neighbor told me, at least I think that’s what she said. If, when we eventually meet, he tells me, no, his name is Dennis, not David, then I would accept this new evidence and henceforth call him Dennis. Nothing could persuade me that my name is not Paul. Delusional statements, as knowledge claims, are expressed with absolute conviction and certainty. They are not susceptible to rational interrogation and evidence-based counterarguments. They are rock solid in the way that knowledge of one’s own name is rock solid.

9. Here’s how we conventionally think of the mind-body problem (“mind-body”; “mind-brain”; “mind-matter”; “problem of consciousness”—I’m using these terms interchangeably). There is a world out there, a world of physical objects, forces and events. We flesh-and-bone human beings are part of it. But every second of our waking lives is bathed in a swirl of thoughts, feelings and sensations that occupy a private, inner space, a mental sphere that seems of quite a different character from the physical world of objects and forces. So, we feel obliged to ask, what is the relation of one to the other and, in particular, how does the insentient, physical stuff of the brain—the proteins, the fats, the sugars and the salts, the cells and their multifarious molecules, the 1,200 cubic centimeters of gloop that fills our skulls—how does that stuff create awareness? It’s beyond dispute that brains are crucial for consciousness but, cubic centimeter by cubic centimeter, it would seem preposterous to suggest that brain matter itself is conscious. Taking the brain as a whole, though, consciousness somehow happens. How? That’s the problem of consciousness, the great mystery that Nietzsche called the knot of the world.

10. The alternative to dualism is monism, the view that the world consists of just one kind of stuff, be it mental or material. Most neuroscientists are in the materialist camp and think that, ultimately, the mind, consciousness included, can be explained in terms of the physical operations of the brain. This is what’s known as a reductionist approach, the mental being reduced to the physical.
   - Location: 2470-2473
   - Page: 162

11. Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA and, in his later years, consciousness researcher, encapsulated this reductionist assumption in what he called the Astonishing Hypothesis: “that ‘you,’ your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.” The challenge is to identify the neural correlates of consciousness, precisely which features of brain function are necessary and sufficient for consciousness to come about. But Crick’s hypothesis seems to rest on the assumption that brain activity is indeed sufficient for consciousness, beyond being just necessary (most people accept that brains are necessary).
   - Location: 2474-2480
   - Page: 162

12. Crick’s Astonishing Hypothesis, by the way, is not all that novel, having been around in one form or another at least since the seventeenth century, when the likes of Thomas Hobbes, a staunch critic of Descartes, and Baruch Spinoza were arguing for the material basis of the soul. What is really astonishing about Crick’s Astonishing Hypothesis, says Noë, is how astonishing it isn’t.
   - Location: 2484-2487

13. Another view is that, even with a complete knowledge of brain function, there would still be an explanatory gap between physical levels of description (the activity of neurons in the brain) and mental life (experiencing the beauty of birdsong, the sadness of loss, etc.). There is physical stuff on the one hand and conscious experience on the other, and they call for different forms of description and analysis. This is the position taken by the philosopher David Chalmers. He contrasts the Hard Problem and the Easy Problems of consciousness. The Easy Problems cover the bread-and-butter questions of cognitive neuroscience. How are psychological functions (perception, memory, emotion, language, and so on) distributed across different brain systems? How are they implemented at the nitty-gritty neuronal level? Note that these questions are “easy” in the same way that the problems of cosmology or particle physics are easy, which is to say not very easy at all. The point is they can be studied scientifically. Yet how are we to account for conscious awareness from the private, first-person perspective of actual experience, as opposed to public, third-person observations of brain and behavior? What is the redness of a red balloon? Is it something more than the neuronal response of eye and brain to electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 740 nanometers? Or take the example of pain. We can analyze pain biologically and behaviorally as a state caused by bodily damage that predisposes the individual to avoid further damage. Beyond this we can investigate how pain is realized in the nervous system in terms of the activation of so-called A-fiber and C-fiber nerve pathways. But there is nothing here about the feelings involved. That’s the Hard Problem, accounting for the feelings. It’s hard precisely because of the shift from an objective to a subjective point of view. Objective science can tell us about the functions of pain and the associated patterns of physiological activity, but still it seems reasonable to ask, why does it hurt?

14. A pragmatic, commonsense way to characterize consciousness is simply to equate it with being awake. If you can interact with the world, communicate with others, and monitor your own thoughts and actions, then it’s safe to say you are conscious. The opposite applies for states such as sleep, coma, anesthesia and death. There are, of course, gradations of wakefulness, and, in clinical practice, neurologists are stocked with well-defined terms for labeling levels of impaired arousal (in descending order of alertness: clouding of consciousness; lethargy; obtundation; stupor; coma). Clinicians also know, in broad terms, how consciousness relates to brain function, loss of consciousness being associated with extensive damage to the cerebral hemispheres across both sides of the brain, or damage to a deeper structure called the thalamus, or damage to systems way down in the brainstem. The overlying gray matter of the cerebral cortex, the stuff serving the “higher order” functions of perception, language and memory, plays little part in regulating levels of consciousness. So far, so straightforward, but equating consciousness with wakefulness won’t do. When we sleep we dream. We are not displaying the wakeful, behavioral signs of consciousness but while dreaming we are, for sure, having conscious experiences. The converse, wakefulness without awareness, is a defining feature of the so-called vegetative state, which results from extensive damage to the cerebral hemispheres and thalamus, but with the brainstem arousal systems still functional. Patients go through a regular sleep–wakefulness cycle and retain basic reflexes, such as blinking to a sudden loud noise, but in their eyes-open waking state they show no sign of any awareness of themselves or what’s going on around them.
   - Location: 2534-2547
   - Page: 166

15. Equating consciousness with wakefulness is problematic enough but awareness is the real troublemaker. Awareness, or sentience, that subjective feeling like something dimension of conscious experience is much more difficult to pin down. It seems to draw us irresistibly into those stubborn intuitions of the Cartesian thinking thing, in its private, impenetrable inner realm. Whatever it is, consciousness seems fundamental to the value of life, and, come to think of it, maybe that’s not a bad starting point if we’re trying to work toward a definition. Consciousness: the capacity of mind without which one’s life has no value. Suppose you are forced to choose between another ten years of normal, conscious life or another fifty of zombiehood, your body going through the motions of life, and appearing as normal to others, but completely devoid of conscious experience. I’m guessing you’d take the first option. Ten years, ten weeks, ten minutes—anything but zombiehood. Life without consciousness would be no life at all.

16. Philosophy, for Wittgenstein, was more about correcting misunderstandings than solving puzzles, and the philosopher’s treatment of a question was like the treatment of an illness. Our view of the world is clouded with fundamental misconceptions, and the job of philosophy is to restore clarity of vision.
   - Location: 2569-2571

17. But some philosophers and psychologists have turned to thinking about consciousness in relation to embodiment and action, rather than, as is traditionally, intuitively, the case, in relation to processes of perception and thought going on within the brain. There have been many contributors to this movement. The late Susan Hurley made a seminal contribution with her book, Consciousness in Action. Other influential figures include the philosophers Andy Clark, Alva Noë, and Kevin O’Regan. Max Velmans is in the same ballpark, too, I think, or at least in the vicinity, and Nicholas Humphrey, whose ideas we visit later, has plotted an evolutionary story about the behaviors leading to the development of consciousness.
   - Location: 2621-2626
   - Page: 171

18. Hurley refers to “the classical sandwich model of the mind” with its clear separation of perception (input from world to mind) and action (output from mind to world) with cognition crammed between. We should instead think of mind and consciousness in terms of a dynamical relation between brain, body and world, a set of processes built into patterns of perception and action, without specific location. Noë suggests that rather than think of consciousness as an internal process, like digestion, we should consider it as an activity, like dancing. Trying to explain consciousness by focusing exclusively on neuronal activity is like trying to explain what dancing’s all about by studying only the muscles. The dancer’s muscles are crucial, but only part of the picture. Likewise for neurons and consciousness. Experience is not something that happens in us, Noë says; it’s something we do. Experience itself is a kind of dance, “a dynamic of involvement and engagement with the world around us.”

19. With a shift of perspective, a turn to embodied cognition and the extension of mind through body into world, perhaps consciousness will go the way of élan vital, the life force, or essence, once thought necessary to distinguish living things from inanimate matter. Living things, we now understand, have no such added ingredient. The mystery of élan vital eventually just faded away. So too will the mystery of consciousness if we can escape our flawed ways of thinking about it.

20. As ways of making sense of the world, magical and mythical thinking can be contrasted with mechanistic thinking, which is characteristic of the rational, observational approach that science takes. Then there is mentalistic thinking, which we intuitively employ in making sense of our own and other people’s thoughts and actions, in terms of feelings, desires, beliefs and intentions. And so we have the Four Ms: mechanistic; mentalistic; mythic; and magical. They can be placed on a continuum from the natural to the supernatural. Mechanistic explanations of the world fall entirely within the natural realm, and magical explanations fall entirely within the supernatural. Mentalistic and mythical explanations to some extent straddle the natural and the supernatural. By natural I mean obeying the laws of nature and by supernatural I mean defying the laws of nature.

21. “If you don’t believe in anything supernatural,” says the philosopher Tom Clark, “—gods, ghosts, immaterial souls and spirits—then you subscribe to naturalism, the idea that nature is all there is.”

22. “the craving for certainty.” The world is full of mysteries and we should embrace that. He was a little scornful about the physicists’ pursuit of the Holy Grail, a Theory of Everything. Beyond quantum and cosmos there is complexity, and theoretical physics has little to say about the everyday worlds of biology and society—“an insect is far more complicated than a star or a galaxy, and when you get to the human brain…”

23. The Paradox of the Ship of Theseus was given a further twist by the seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who imagined someone reassembling the ship using the original materials. If the same man had kept the old planks as they were taken out, and by putting them afterwards together in the same order, and again made a ship of them, this, without doubt, had also been the same numerical ship with that which was at the beginning; and so there would have been two ships numerically the same, which is absurd.

## Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy
**Author:** Cathy O'Neil

### Highlights (23)

1. No model can include all of the real world’s complexity or the nuance of human communication. Inevitably, some important information gets left out. I
   - Location: 334-335

2. To create a model, then, we make choices about what’s important enough to include, simplifying the world into a toy version that can be easily understood and from which we can infer important facts and actions. We expect it to handle only one job and accept that it will occasionally act like a clueless machine, one with enormous blind spots.

3. Here we see that models, despite their reputation for impartiality, reflect goals and ideology. When I removed the possibility of eating Pop-Tarts at every meal, I was imposing my ideology on the meals model. It’s something we do without a second thought. Our own values and desires influence our choices, from the data we choose to collect to the questions we ask. Models are opinions embedded in mathematics.

4. That was a concern, because mathematical models, by their nature, are based on the past, and on the assumption that patterns will repeat.

5. HR departments, of course, are also eager to save money through the hiring choices they make. One of the biggest expenses for a company is workforce turnover, commonly called churn. Replacing a worker earning $50,000 a year costs a company about $10,000, or 20 percent of that worker’s yearly pay, according to the Center for American Progress. Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiples of that—as much as two years of salary. Naturally, many hiring models attempt to calculate the likelihood that each job candidate will stick around. Evolv, Inc., now a part of Cornerstone OnDemand, helped Xerox scout out prospects for its calling center, which employs more than forty thousand people. The churn model took into account some of the metrics you might expect, including the average time people stuck around on previous jobs. But they also found some intriguing correlations. People the system classified as “creative types” tended to stay longer at the job, while those who scored high on “inquisitiveness” were more likely to set their questioning minds toward other opportunities. But the most problematic correlation had to do with geography. Job applicants who lived farther from the job were more likely to churn. This makes sense: long commutes are a pain. But Xerox managers noticed another correlation. Many of the people suffering those long commutes were coming from poor neighborhoods. So Xerox, to its credit, removed that highly correlated churn data from its model. The company sacrificed a bit of efficiency for fairness.

6. In the higher echelons of the economy, companies are on the hunt for employees who think creatively and work well in teams. So the modelers’ challenge is to pinpoint, in the vast world of Big Data, the bits of information that correlate with originality and social skills.

7. When I consider the sloppy and self-serving ways that companies use data, I’m often reminded of phrenology, a pseudoscience that was briefly the rage in the nineteenth century. Phrenologists would run their fingers over the patient’s skull, probing for bumps and indentations. Each one, they thought, was linked to personality traits that existed in twenty-seven regions of the brain. Usually, the conclusion of the phrenologist jibed with the observations he made. If a patient was morbidly anxious or suffering from alcoholism, the skull probe would usually find bumps and dips that correlated with that observation—which, in turn, bolstered faith in the science of phrenology. Phrenology was a model that relied on pseudoscientific nonsense to make authoritative pronouncements, and for decades it went untested. Big Data can fall into the same trap.

8. new software scheduling programs offer far more sophisticated options. They process new streams of ever-changing data, from the weather to pedestrian patterns. A rainy afternoon, for example, will likely drive people from the park into cafés. So they’ll need more staffing, at least for an hour or two. High school football on Friday night might mean more foot traffic on Main Street, but only before and after the game, not during it. Twitter volume suggests that 26 percent more shoppers will rush out to tomorrow’s Black Friday sales than did last year. Conditions change, hour by hour, and the workforce must be deployed to match the fluctuating demand. Otherwise the company is wasting money. The money saved, naturally, comes straight from employees’ pockets. Under the inefficient status quo, workers had not only predictable hours but also a certain amount of downtime. You could argue that they benefited from inefficiency: some were able to read on the job, even study. Now, with software choreographing the work, every minute should be busy. And these minutes will come whenever the program demands it, even if it means clopening from Friday to Saturday.

9. Rich people buy cruises and BMWs. All too often, poor people need a payday loan. And since these statistical models appear to work much of the time, efficiency rises and profits surge. Investors double down on scientific systems that can place thousands of people into what appear to be the correct buckets. It’s the triumph of Big Data. And what about the person who is misunderstood and placed in the wrong bucket? That happens. And there’s no feedback to set the system straight. A statistics-crunching engine has no way to learn that it dispatched a valuable potential customer to call center hell. Worse, losers in the unregulated e-score universe have little recourse to complain, much less correct the system’s error. In the realm of WMDs, they’re collateral damage.

10. How many Wanda Taylors are out there clearing up false identities and other errors in our data? The answer: not nearly enough. Humans in the data economy are outliers and throwbacks. The systems are built to run automatically as much as possible. That’s the efficient way; that’s where the profits are. Errors are inevitable, as in any statistical program, but the quickest way to reduce them is to fine-tune the algorithms running the machines.

12. My point is that oceans of behavioral data, in coming years, will feed straight into artificial intelligence systems. And these will remain, to human eyes, black boxes. Throughout this process, we will rarely learn about the tribes we “belong” to or why we belong there. In the era of machine intelligence, most of the variables will remain a mystery. Many of those tribes will mutate hour by hour, even minute by minute, as the systems shuttle people from one group to another. After all, the same person acts very differently at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. These automatic programs will increasingly determine how we are treated by the other machines, the ones that choose the ads we see, set prices for us, line us up for a dermatologist appointment, or map our routes. They will be highly efficient, seemingly arbitrary, and utterly unaccountable. No one will understand their logic or be able to explain it. If we don’t wrest back a measure of control, these future WMDs will feel mysterious and powerful. They’ll have their way with us, and we’ll barely know it’s happening.

13. Michelin, the tire company, sets its employees goals for metrics ranging from blood pressure to glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and waist size. Those who don’t reach the targets in three categories have to pay an extra $1,000 a year toward their health insurance. The national drugstore chain CVS announced in 2013 that it would require employees to report their levels of body fat, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol—or pay $600 a year.

14. But isn’t it a good thing, wellness advocates will ask, to help people deal with their weight and other health issues? The key question is whether this help is an offer or a command. If companies set up free and voluntary wellness programs, few would have reason to object. (And workers who opt in to such programs do, in fact, register gains, though they might well have done so without them.) But tying a flawed statistic like BMI to compensation, and compelling workers to mold their bodies to the corporation’s ideal, infringes on freedom. It gives companies an excuse to punish people they don’t like to look at—and to remove money from their pockets at the same time.

Their conclusion: “Emotional states can be transferred to others…, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness.” In other words, Facebook’s algorithms can affect how millions of people feel, and those people won’t know that it’s happening.

16. Much the same is true of Google. Its search algorithm appears to be focused on raising revenue. But search results, if Google so chose, could have a dramatic effect on what people learn and how they vote. Two researchers, Robert Epstein and Ronald E. Robertson, recently asked undecided voters in both the United States and India to use a search engine to learn about upcoming elections. The engines they used were programmed to skew the search results, favoring one party over another. Those results, they said, shifted voting preferences by 20 percent.
   - Location: 2561-2565
   - Page: 168

17. This effect was powerful, in part, because people widely trust search engines. Some 73 percent of Americans, according to a Pew Research report, believe that search results are both accurate and impartial. So companies like Google would be risking their own reputation, and inviting a regulatory crackdown, if they doctored results to favor one political outcome over another.

18. Modern consumer marketing, however, provides politicians with new pathways to specific voters so that they can tell them what they know they want to hear. Once they do, those voters are likely to accept the information at face value because it confirms their previous beliefs, a phenomenon psychologists call confirmation bias. It is one reason that none of the invited donors at the Romney event questioned his assertion that nearly half of voters were hungry for government handouts. It only bolstered their existing beliefs.
   - Location: 2596-2599
   - Page: 170

19. This merging of politics and consumer marketing has been developing for the last half century, as the tribal rituals of American politics, with their ward bosses and long phone lists, have given way to marketing science. In The Selling of the President, which followed Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign, the journalist Joe McGinniss introduced readers to the political operatives working to market the presidential candidate like a consumer good. By using focus groups, Nixon’s campaign was able to hone his pitch for different regions and demographics.

20. The convergence of Big Data and consumer marketing now provides politicians with far more powerful tools. They can target microgroups of citizens for both votes and money and appeal to each of them with a meticulously honed message, one that no one else is likely to see. It might be a banner on Facebook or a fund-raising email. But each one allows candidates to quietly sell multiple versions of themselves—and it’s anyone’s guess which version will show up for work after inauguration.

21. Our national motto, E Pluribus Unum, means “Out of Many, One.” But WMDs reverse the equation. Working in darkness, they carve one into many, while hiding us from the harms they inflict upon our neighbors near and far. And those harms are legion.
   - Location: 2771-2772
   - Page: 181

22. Big Data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that’s something only humans can provide. We have to explicitly embed better values into our algorithms, creating Big Data models that follow our ethical lead. Sometimes that will mean putting fairness ahead of profit.

23. Like doctors, data scientists should pledge a Hippocratic Oath, one that focuses on the possible misuses and misinterpretations of their models. Following the market crash of 2008, two financial engineers, Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott, drew up such an oath. It reads: ~  I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations. ~  Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics. ~  I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so. ~  Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights. ~  I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.

## Denying Science: Conspiracy Theories, Media Distortions, and the War Against Reality
**Author:** John Grant

### Highlights (11)

1. Is science denialism merely a product of ignorance or illiteracy? In many instances it certainly is. In their Unscientific America (2009), however, chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum point out that there’s no simple equation: Many antivaxers and AGW2 “skeptics” have considerably more scientific knowledge than the average citizen, having researched extensively, usually on the Internet, to find everything they can that’ll reinforce their convictions. The trouble is that, through ignoring all the rest of the information, they’re essentially creating a false worldview—false because it’s incomplete. Obviously, the worldview of anyone is incomplete; the difference is that many of us recognize our areas of ignorance and rely on experts to fill in the gaps—just as most of us call a plumber rather than attack that burst pipe ourselves. There’s no shame in being ignorant about something—in fact, about lots of things—because it’s essential for our survival that we don’t try to be “jacks of all trades, masters of none.” The danger lies in being unaware of our areas of ignorance or in thinking ignorance deserves an equal voice in debate as expertise. Of relevance here is the Dunning–Kruger effect, first formally described in 1999 in “Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments”3 by Justin Kruger and David Dunning: “We argue that when people are incompetent in the strategies they adopt to achieve success and satisfaction, they suffer a dual burden: Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize

2. A corollary is that “unskilled” people are far more certain about things than “skilled” ones; further, “unskilled” people regard it as a weakness when others use statements like “all the evidence suggests” rather than the— always false—“we know for a fact.”

5. As Bertrand Russell wrote, in “Is There a God?” (1952): If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion. . . . But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity. . . .1

7. In 2009, the National Research Council’s Committee on Identifying the Needs of the Forensic Sciences Community released a devastating report titled Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, which concluded that the country’s forensic services were essentially in a mess.26 Discussing the report on Reason.com, Radley Balko summarized the essential problem: Most forensic disciplines were invented by police investigators, not scientists. Courts have allowed these disciplines to be admitted into evidence before they’ve been subjected to any serious scrutiny from the scientific community. . . . Yet when a forensic specialist testifies in the courtroom, his testimony usually carries the weight and veneer of actual science.27

9. It’s a sad but generally accepted fact of medical science that in only about 15 percent of cases is there evidence that the “scientific” part of the treatment has actually done any good.6 The rest is down to the placebo effect, or to the body’s ability to cure itself of most ailments, or to the patient’s trust in the doctor, and so forth. Thus, a purveyor of fake medicine may be able to record a modest success rate in treating certain ailments. In blind trials of new drugs, it emerges pretty consistently that about 30 percent of the people who’ve been receiving the placebo feel better as a result. Thus, the average CAMster can expect a roughly 30 percent success rate even before other factors kick in. However, despite the power of the placebo effect, we really don’t understand it. For example, it’s been found that the effectiveness of a placebo is influenced by the form in which it’s delivered: pill, capsule, liquid or, generally best of all, injection (there are cases of military surgeons in war zones who, bereft of anesthetics, have injected saline water to great anesthetic effect). With pills and capsules, such seemingly ephemeral matters as color and shape are important. Taking two placebo pills a day works better than taking just one. And as a general rule expensive placebos work better than cheap ones. One of the most startling results to emerge in recent years is that Valium® (diazepam), for many years the mainstay of outpatient anxiety treatment—the “Mother’s Little Helper” of the Stones song—works only if the patient knows it’s being administered;7 its beneficial results in relieving anxiety would thus appear entirely the product of placebo, even though untold millions will attest that Valium worked for them.

10. The original snake oil, shéyóu, was probably fairly efficacious. It was oil from the fat sac of a particular type of sea snake, extracted by chinese physicians for use in the treatment of arthritis. Sea snake oil, like fish oil, is rich in omega-3 fats, and ingesting these has a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect. However, this is not the snake oil whose use has given the language a synonym for quack medicine. The entrepreneur concerned, one Clark Stanley—the so-called Rattlesnake King—presented his Stanley’s Snake Oil at the 1893 chicago World Fair, demonstrating its means of preparation: Take your rattler, slit its belly open, throw it into boiling water, cream off the fat that rises to the surface, and, bingo, you have a liniment suitable for treating a range of joint ailments, toothache, sore throat, frostbite . . . The trouble is that this isn’t how Stanley’s Snake Oil was prepared; he was just being a showman. When the feds finally got around to testing the stuff in 1917 they found it contained no snake oil; it was a mixture of ingredients like turpentine, camphor, red pepper, mineral oil, and a small amount of animal fat (probably lard). Curiously, this might have had some useful effect as a liniment—unlike actual rattlesnake oil. As rattlesnake oil is deficient in omega-3s, there’s no point in swallowing it, either.

11. On January 31, 2006, addressing the Palm Beach Atlantic University in Florida on the subject “Science Does Not Need God, or Does It? A Catholic Scientist Looks at Evolution,” the Vatican Observatory Director, Father George V. Coyne, heavily underlined the church’s position: I would essentially like to share with you two convictions in this presentation: (1) that the Intelligent Design (ID) movement, while evoking a God of power and might, a designer God, actually belittles God, makes her/him too small and paltry; (2) that our scientific understanding of the universe, untainted by religious considerations, provides for those who believe in God a marvelous opportunity to reflect upon their beliefs. Please note carefully that I distinguish . . . that science and religion are totally separate human pursuits.13

## A Magical World: Superstition and Science From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment
**Author:** Derek K. Wilson

### Highlights (4)

1. Not only was it regarded as heresy to dispute traditional interpretations of Holy Scripture, it was considered the next worst thing to heresy to disagree with the Greek pioneers of philosophy and science. Thus, although Bede demonstrated inaccuracies in the Julian calendar, these inaccuracies were not acknowledged and addressed until the old system was replaced by the Gregorian calendar almost eight centuries later.
   - Location: 228-231

2. Two approaches to philosophy that diverged with increasing clarity during the Renaissance were the Aristotelian method based on the drawing of conclusions from accepted first principles and the creation of principles from observation and experimentation – eventually known as the inductive method (see p. 115). For professional healers there was always a third, and more important, consideration: treatment – what we now call ‘clinical medicine’. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that medical practice combined traditional theory and experimentation.

3. the development of the inductive method. Aristotle’s method of discovering truth, as set out in his Organon (Instrument), was to formulate hypotheses and then test them by observation. Bacon insisted that the philosopher must begin with observation and, by experimental testing, discover the truths to which it leads.

## Thinking

### Highlights (58)

1. was at that point enamored of the McCulloch-Pitts logical neuron. McCulloch and Pitts had put together the idea of a very simple artificial neuron, a computational neuron, which had multiple inputs and a single branching output and a threshold for firing, and the inputs were either inhibitory or excitatory. They proved that in principle a neural net made of these logical neurons could compute anything you wanted to compute.

2. Evolutionary biologist David Haig has some lovely papers on intrapersonal conflicts where he’s talking about how even at the level of the genetics—even at the level of the conflict between the genes you get from your mother and the genes you get from your father, the so-called madumnal and padumnal genes—those are in opponent relations, and if they get out of whack, serious imbalances can happen that show up as particular psychological anomalies.

3. Each neuron is imprisoned in your brain. I now think of these as cells within cells, as cells within prison cells. Realize that every neuron in your brain, every human cell in your body (leaving aside all the symbionts), is a direct descendant of eukaryotic cells that lived and fended for themselves for about a billion years as free-swimming, free-living little agents. They fended for themselves, and they survived. They had to develop an awful lot of know-how, a lot of talent, a lot of self-protective talent to do that. When they joined forces into multicellular creatures, they gave up a lot of that. They became, in effect, domesticated. They became part of larger, more monolithic organizations. My hunch is that that’s true in general. We don’t have to worry about our muscle cells rebelling against us, or anything like that. When they do, we call it cancer, but in the brain I think that (and this is my wild idea) maybe only in one species, us, and maybe only in the obviously more volatile parts of the brain, the cortical areas, some little switch has been thrown in the genetics that, in effect, makes our neurons a little bit feral, a little bit like what happens when you let sheep or pigs go feral, and they recover their wild talents very fast.

4. As soon as that happens, you have room for cooperation to create alliances, and I suspect that a more free-wheeling, anarchic organization is the secret of our greater capacities of creativity, imagination, thinking outside the box and all that, and the price we pay for it is our susceptibility to obsessions, mental illnesses, delusions, and smaller problems.

6. In this regard, I think of John Holland’s work on the emergence of order. His example is New York City. You can always find a place where you can get gefilte fish, or sushi, or saddles, or just about anything under the sun you want, and you don’t have to worry about a state bureaucracy that is making sure that supplies get through. No. The market takes care of it. The individual web of entrepreneurship and selfish agency provides a host of goods and services, and is an extremely sensitive instrument that responds to needs very quickly. Until the lights go out. Well, we’re all at the mercy of the power man. I am quite concerned that we’re becoming hyper-fragile as a civilization, and we’re becoming so dependent on technologies that are not as reliable as they should be, that have so many conditions that have to be met for them to work, that we may specialize ourselves into some very serious jams. But in the meantime, thinking about the self-organizational powers of the brain as being very much like the self-organizational powers of a city is not a bad idea. It just reeks of overenthusiastic metaphor, though, and it’s worth reminding ourselves that this idea has been around since Plato.

7. Basically, the model that we have and have used for several thousand years is the model that culture consists of treasures, cultural treasures. Just like money, or like tools and houses, you bequeath them to your children, and you amass them, and you protect them, and because they’re valuable, you maintain them and prepare them, and then you hand them on to the next generation, and some societies are rich, and some societies are poor, but it’s all goods. I think that vision is true of only the tip of the iceberg. Most of the regularities in culture are not treasures. It’s not all opera and science and fortifications and buildings and ships. It includes all kinds of bad habits and ugly patterns and stupid things that don’t really matter but that somehow have got a grip on a society and that are part of the ecology of the human species, in the same way that mud, dirt and grime, and fleas are part of the world that we live in. They’re not our treasures. We may give our fleas to our children, but we’re not trying to. It’s not a blessing. It’s a curse, and I think there are a lot of cultural fleas. There are lots of things that we pass on without even noticing that we’re doing it, and, of course, language is a prime case of this—very little deliberate, intentional language instruction goes on or has to go on.

8. INTRODUCTION by Daniel Kahneman Recipient of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics; Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology Emeritus, Princeton University; author, Thinking, Fast and Slow. Philip Tetlock’s 2005 book Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? demonstrated that accurate long-term political forecasting is, to a good approximation, impossible. The work was a landmark in social science, and its importance was quickly recognized and rewarded in two academic disciplines—political science and psychology. Perhaps more significantly, the work was recognized in the intelligence community, which accepted the challenge of investing significant resources in a search for improved accuracy. The work is ongoing, important discoveries are being made, and Tetlock gives us a chance to peek at what is happening.

9. There is quite a bit of skepticism about political punditry, but there’s also a huge appetite for it.

10. it’s very hard for political analysts to do appreciably better than chance when you move beyond about one year. Second, political analysts think they know a lot more about the future than they actually do. When they say they’re 80 or 90 percent confident, they’re often right only 60 or 70 percent of the time. There was systematic overconfidence.

13. But how do real people make good decisions under the usual conditions of little time and scarce information? Consider how players catch a ball—in baseball, cricket, or soccer. It may seem that they would have to solve complex differential equations in their heads to predict the trajectory of the ball. In fact, players use a simple heuristic. When a ball comes in high, the player fixates on the ball and starts running. The heuristic is to adjust the running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant—that is, the angle between the eye and the ball. The player can ignore all the information necessary to compute the trajectory, such as the ball’s initial velocity, distance, and angle, and just focus on one piece of information, the angle of gaze.”

14. Gigerenzer provides an alternative to the view of the mind as a cognitive optimizer, and also to its mirror image, the mind as a cognitive miser. The fact that people ignore information has been often mistaken as a form of irrationality, and shelves are filled with books that explain how people routinely commit cognitive fallacies. In seven years of research, he and his research team at the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin have worked out what he believes is a viable alternative: the study of fast and frugal decision making, that is, the study of smart heuristics people actually use to make good decisions. In order to make good decisions in an uncertain world, one sometimes has to ignore information. The art is knowing what one doesn’t have to know.

15. At the beginning of the 20th century the father of modern science fiction, Herbert George Wells, said in his writings on politics, “If we want to have an educated citizenship in a modern technological society, we need to teach them three things: reading, writing, and statistical thinking.” At the beginning of the 21st century, how far have we gotten with this program? In our society, we teach most citizens reading and writing from the time they are children, but not statistical thinking. John Alan Paulos has called this phenomenon innumeracy.

16. cost-benefit computations for doctors are not the same as for patients. One cannot simply accuse doctors of knowing things or not caring about patients, but a doctor has to face the possibility that if he or she doesn’t advise someone to participate in the PSA test and that person gets prostate cancer, then the patient may turn up at his doorstep with a lawyer. The second thing is that doctors are members of a community with professional pride, and, for many of them, not detecting a cancer is something they don’t want to have on their records. Third, there are groups of doctors who have very clear financial incentives to perform certain procedures. A good doctor would explain this to a patient but leave the decision to the patient. Many patients don’t see this situation in which doctors find themselves, but most doctors will recommend the test.

17. Economic decisions are inherently affective forecasts. Economists believe that people engage in economic transactions in order to “maximize their utility.” Now, for psychologists the word utility isn’t particularly meaningful unless you are talking about gas and electricity. Psychologists argue that utility is actually a stand-in for something like happiness or satisfaction—some subjective, hedonic state of the decision maker. That sounds a bit squishy to modern economists, who often confuse utility with wealth, but how could it be otherwise? People engage in economic transactions in order to get things that they believe will provide them with positive emotional experiences, and wealth is nothing more than an “experience credit” that can be used to attain those experiences in the future. So rational economic behavior requires that we look into the future and figure out what will provide that experience and what won’t. As it turns out, people make systematic errors when they do this, which is why their economic decisions are so often suboptimal. The problem lies in how we imagine our future hedonic states.
   - Location: 798-806
   - Page: 52

18. Systematic errors beg for scientific explanations, and as it turns out, the errors that people make when they try to predict their emotional futures are quite systematic. Specifically, people tend to overestimate the impact of future events. That is, they predict that future events will have a more intense and more enduring hedonic impact than they actually do. We call this the impact bias.
   - Location: 819-822

19. First, people have a tremendous talent for changing their views of events so that they can feel better about them. We’re not immediately delighted when our wife runs away with another guy, but in fairly short order most of us start to realize that “she was never really right for me” or that “we didn’t have that much in common.”
   - Location: 842-844
   - Page: 55

20. But there’s a second way to make these kinds of forecasts, namely, to find somebody who’s already experiencing that future and observe how they actually feel. If you were trying to decide whether you should take job X or job Y, you might try to imagine yourself in each of them, but you might instead observe people who have job X and job Y and simply see how happy they are. What we’ve discovered is that (a) when people do this, they make extremely accurate affective forecasts, and (b) no one does this unless you force them to!

21. First of all, wealth is a poor predictor of happiness. It’s not a useless predictor, but it is quite limited. The first $40,000 or so buys you almost all of the happiness you can get from wealth. The difference between earning nothing and earning $20,000 is enormous—that’s the difference between having shelter and food and being homeless and hungry. But economists have shown us that after basic needs are met, there isn’t much “marginal utility” to increased wealth. In other words, the difference between a guy who makes $15,000 and a guy who makes $40,000 is much bigger than the difference between the guy who makes $100,000 and the guy who makes $1,000,000.

22. social relationships are a powerful predictor of happiness—much more so than money is. Happy people have extensive social networks and good relationships with the people in those networks. What’s interesting to me is that while money is weakly and complexly correlated with happiness, and social relationships are strongly and simply correlated with happiness, most of us spend most of our time trying to be happy by pursuing wealth.

23. In apotemnophilia you are dealing with a perfectly healthy, normal individual, not mentally disturbed in any way, not psychotic, not emotionally disturbed, often holding a job, and has a family. We saw a patient recently who was a prominent dean of an engineering school, and soon after he retired he came out and said he wants his left arm amputated above the elbow. Here’s a perfectly normal guy who has been living a normal life in society and interacting with people. He’s never told anybody that he harbored this secret desire—intense desire—to have his arm amputated ever since early childhood, and he never came out and told people about it for fear that they might think he was crazy. He came to see us recently and we tried to figure out what was going on in his brain. And by the way, this disorder is not rare. There are websites devoted to it. About one-third of them go on to actually get it amputated—not in this country because it’s not legal, but they go to Mexico or somewhere else and get it amputated.

24. messages from the arm and the skin throughout the body, in fact, go to the parietal lobe to a structure, the postcentral gyrus. There’s a big furrow, or cleft, right down the middle of the brain called the central sulcus. Just behind that sulcus there is a vertical, narrow strip of cortex where there’s a complete map of your body’s surface. Every point of your body’s surface is represented in a specific point on the cortex and there’s a complete map called the Penfield Map. That’s where touch sensations and, behind it, joint sensations and muscle sensations are all represented in this somatosensory map.

25. One of the things we learn in medicine is that when a patient is trying to tell you something and you think he’s crazy, it often means that you’re not smart enough to figure it out. Sometimes he’s crazy, but usually it means you’re not smart enough to figure it out, so look carefully, talk to the patient.

26. But in the mid 1970s, Tim Wilson and Dick Nisbett opened the basement door with their landmark paper entitled “Telling More Than We Can Know,” in which they reported a series of experiments showing that people are often unaware of the true causes of their own actions, and that when they are asked to explain those actions, they simply make stuff up. People don’t realize they are making stuff up, of course; they truly believe the stories they are telling about why they did what they did. But as the experiments showed, people are telling more than they can know.

27. Wilson has since discovered and documented a variety of fascinating ways in which all of us are “strangers to ourselves” (which also happens to be the title of his last book—a book that Malcolm Gladwell, writing in The New Yorker, correctly called the best popular psychology book published in the last 20 years).

29. One of the basic assumptions of the field is that it’s not the objective environment that influences people, but their constructs of the world. You have to get inside people’s heads and see the world the way they do. You have to look at the kinds of narratives and stories people tell themselves as to why they’re doing what they’re doing. What can get people into trouble sometimes in their personal lives, or for more societal problems, is that these stories go wrong. People end up with narratives that are dysfunctional in some way.

30. a lot of the current programs in a wide variety of areas have never been vetted in that way, and are just based on common sense. There are lots of famous examples—for example, the D.A.R.E. antidrug program, which my two kids went through when they were in school. In fact, 70 percent of schools in America use this program. It was not tested until fairly recently, and the results showed that not only does it not work, but there is also a hint of evidence that it actually increases alcohol and tobacco use in students. I find it shocking that something that turns out to have a negative effect, or at best, no effect, has been implemented in 70 percent of our schools before we even tested it.

31. my friend and colleague Jamie Pennebaker has developed a writing exercise that is typically done three or four nights in a row, where you write about a problem for about 15 minutes each time. Doing so has remarkable long-term benefits on people’s health and well-being.
   - Location: 1448-1450
   - Page: 95

32. Researchers such as Ethan Kross and Ozlem Ayduk have honed this method and, along with Pennebaker, have shown how it works. Think back to the story-editing metaphor: what these writing exercises do is make us address problems that we haven’t been able to make sense of and put us through a sense-making process of reworking it in such a way that we gain a new perspective and find some meaning, so that we basically come up with a better story that allows us to put that problem behind us. This is a great example of a story-editing technique that can be quite powerful.

33. liberals may have somewhat different moral foundations than conservatives. Jon has persuasively argued that one reason that political discourse has become so heated and divisive in our country is that there is a lack of understanding in one camp of the moral foundations that the other camp is using to interpret and evaluate the world. If we can increase that understanding, we might lower the heat and improve the dialogue between people on opposite ends of the political spectrum.

35. There are some fairly old philosophical issues about what confers identity and uniqueness, and these are the principles, quiddity and haecceity. I hadn’t even heard of these issues until I started to research into it, and it turns out these obscure terms come from the philosopher Duns Scotus. Quiddity is the invisible properties, the essence shared by members of a group, so that would be the “dogginess” of all dogs. But the haecceity is the unique property of the individual, so that would be Fido’s haecceity or Fido’s essence, which makes Fido distinct to another dog, for example.

36. As we all know, memory is notoriously fallible. It’s not cast in stone. It’s not something that is stable. It’s constantly reshaping itself. So the fact that we have a multitude of unconscious processes that are generating this coherence of consciousness, which is the “I” experience, and the truth that our memories are very selective and ultimately corruptible—we tend to remember things that fit with our general characterization of what our self is. We tend to ignore all the information that is inconsistent. We have all these attribution biases. We have cognitive dissonance. The very thing psychology keeps telling us, that we have all these unconscious mechanisms that reframe information, to fit with a coherent story, then both the “I” and the “me,” to all intents and purposes, are generated narratives.

37. even a lot of atheists or self-stated atheists or agnostics still nevertheless entertained beliefs which were pretty irrational.

Violations of the natural laws I see as being supernatural. That’s what makes them supernatural.

It doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but that’s just a finding that’s consistently found. You find that difference from the earliest point you can put babies into the scanner, so some of the studies are at two weeks old in terms of infants. You also find that if you look at postmortem tissue, looking at the human brain in terms of postmortem tissue, that the male brain has more connections, more synapses between nerve cells. It’s about a 30 percent difference on average between males and females. These differences are there.

The second big difference between males and females is about how much gray matter and white matter we see in the brain: that males have more gray matter and more white matter on average than the female brain does. White matter, just to be succinct, is mostly about connections between different parts of the brain. The gray matter is more about the cell bodies in the brain.

43. I’ve talked a little bit about neuroanatomy, but in terms of psychology, there are also sex differences that are reported. On average, females are developing empathy at a faster rate than males. I keep using that word “on average” because none of these findings apply to all females or all males. You simply see differences emerge when you compare groups of males and females. Empathy seems to be developing faster in girls, and in contrast, in boys there seems to be a stronger drive to systemize. I use that word “systemizing,” which is all about trying to figure out how systems work, becoming fascinated with systems. And systems could take a variety of different forms. It could be a mechanical system, like a computer; it could be a natural system, like the weather; it could be an abstract system, like mathematics; but boys seem to have a stronger interest in systematic information.

45. System one is really about intuition, people using the expertise and the experience they’ve gained. System two is a way of monitoring things, and we need both of those, and we need to blend them, and so it bothers me to see controversies about which is the right one, or are people fundamentally irrational and therefore they can’t be trusted. Obviously, system one is marvelous. Danny Kahneman has put it this way: “System one is marvelous, intuition is marvelous but flawed.” And system two isn’t the replacement for our intuition and for our experience; it’s a way of making sure we don’t get ourselves in trouble. If we eliminate system one, system two isn’t going to get the job done because you can’t live by system two. There are people who try—there are people who have had various kinds of brain lesions that create disconnects between their emotions and their decision-making process. Antonio Damasio has written about them. It can take them 30 minutes to figure out what restaurant they want to go to. Their performance on intelligence tests isn’t impaired, but their performance in living their lives is greatly impaired; they can’t function well, and their lives go downhill. So we know that trying to do everything purely rationally, just following Bayesian statistics or anything like that, isn’t going to work. We need both system one and system two, and so my question is, what are the effective ways of blending the two? What are the effective ways that allow people to develop expertise, and to use expertise while still being able to monitor their ideas, and monitor their actions?

46. many organizations that I study try to encourage people to just follow procedures, just follow the steps, and to be afraid to make any mistakes. The result is that they stamp out insights in their organization. They stamp out development of expertise in their organization, and they actually reduce the effectiveness and the performance of the organizations.

47. Intuition is about expertise and tacit knowledge. I’ll contrast tacit knowledge with explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is knowledge of factual material. I can tell people facts, I can tell them over the phone, and they’ll know things. I can say I was born in the Bronx, and now you know where I was born. That’s an example of explicit knowledge, it’s factual information. But there are other forms of knowledge. There’s knowledge about routines. Routines you can think of as a set of steps. But there’s also tacit knowledge, and expertise about when to start each step, and when it’s finished, when you’re done and ready to start the next one, and whether the steps are working or not. So even for routines, some expertise is needed. There are other aspects of tacit knowledge that are about intuition, like our ability to make perceptual discriminations, so as we get experience, we can see things that we couldn’t see before.

48. Judgments based on intuition seem mysterious because intuition doesn’t involve explicit knowledge. It doesn’t involve declarative knowledge about facts. Therefore, we can’t explicitly trace the origins of our intuitive judgments. They come from other parts of our knowing. They come from our tacit knowledge and so they feel magical. Intuition sometimes feels like we have ESP, but it isn’t magical—it’s really a consequence of the experience we’ve built up.

49. if I ask you, “How wrong is it to falsify information on your CV in order to get a better job?” you might think that you just go through a rational process, and think of the reasons why this is wrong, or perhaps why it’s not so bad. But we found that when you put people in certain emotional states, for example, if you have them sit at a table that happens to be very sticky, dirty, and disgusting, then people make different decisions. If you sit at a disgusting table, or let’s say you’re smelling a disgusting smell in the room, then you’re more likely to say that falsifying your CV in order to get a better job is really wrong compared to somebody who sits at a clean table, or somebody who doesn’t have a nasty smell around them. Similarly we find that when you give people a chance to feel very clean and pure, they decide that something like falsifying their CV is not so bad, it’s proper behavior, or it’s okay, it’s clean. It seems like however people happen to be feeling at the moment colors their judgments about some even very fundamental decisions of whether it is right or wrong to do something.

## How Music Works
**Author:** John Powell

### Highlights (20)

1. The pitch at which you “sing” a word in a language like Mandarin is vital to communication: each word has several unrelated meanings depending on its pitch. The word “ma,” for example, means “mother” if you sing/say it at a high, level pitch—but it means “hemp” if you start at a middle pitch that then rises; or “horse” if you start lower then fall and rise. If you start high and let the tone fall you are saying “lazy.” So an innocent question such as “Is lunch ready, Mother?” could easily become “Where’s my lunch, you horse?”
   - Location: 179-182

2. The reason why very few Westerners develop this note memory is because it isn’t very useful to us—in fact, it can be a bit of a pain to have perfect pitch because it makes the whistling or singing of most people sound terribly out of tune.
   - Location: 185-186
   - Page: 13

3. Professional musicians were (and still are) often trained from a very early age, and some of them would have developed “perfect” pitch, which agreed with the pitch chosen by a local piano tuner or organ builder. As soon as they began to travel they would discover other highly trained professionals with different “perfect” pitch. It’s a bit like everyone declaring that their favorite shade of pink is the perfect pink. All these “perfect” pitches were equally valid. To have perfect pitch all you need is a set of pitches etched into your long-term memory. You don’t even need to know what the notes are called—you might have stored all the notes on your mom’s piano without ever being told that this one is B flat and that one is D, etc.

5. Chord: A chord is the sound made by three or more notes played at the same time. Harmony: A succession of chords produces a harmony. The relationship between chords and harmony is therefore similar to that between words and sentences.

6. When composers (and by composers I mean people who write pop songs and advertising jingles, as well as Mozart and Co.) write a piece of music, they usually use harmony to provide a background to the melody. This harmony can alter the mood of the melody just as the background of a photograph can make a portrait more or less cheerful. Film music composers often use only three or four tunes for an entire film, and they need to change the feel of the melody to match the moods of the different scenes. Techniques for altering the mood of the music include using different instruments (if it’s a scene in Paris we will hear the obligatory accordion) and playing the melody faster or slower. But playing the tune with a different harmony is one of the most effective ways of manipulating our emotions.

If you want to hear some excellent examples of counterpoint, I recommend the Concerto for Two Violins (in D minor) by Bach, and if you want to hear a great fugue, it’s best to listen to one played on a solo instrument so you can hear the separate tunes (called voices) clearly. Bach’s “Little Fugue in G minor” played on a piano is a good example.

14. Next time you are near a piano, try using one finger to pick out a melody using only the black keys—this is the sound of a pentatonic scale or key. All the melodies you play using these five notes to the octave will sound pleasant.

16. It’s important to realize that ancient civilizations all over the world independently developed a system of tuning their instruments to the pentatonic scale. This tuning system had to be based on a naturally occurring phenomenon; otherwise it would not have been discovered by lots of civilizations. The physical phenomenon in question involves the vibration of strings.

17. Even though Galileo’s father (Vincenzo Galilei) got the correct answer in 1581, the equal temperament system didn’t come into common use until the late 1700s. The Chinese scholar Chu Tsai-Yu beat Galilei to it by one year, but when he presented his result to the Chinese musical fraternity he got the same response as his Italian counterpart—“get back to the triangles and leave music to the musicians.” The British can be particularly proud of the piano firm Broadwood, who refused to change to the new, better system until 1846—hurrah! Galilei and Chu Tsai-Yu found that calculating the equal temperament system is pretty easy once you have presented the problem in a clear, logical way. All you need are three focused rules: 1. A note an octave above another must have twice the frequency of the lower one. (This is the same as saying that if you use two identical strings, one must be half the length of the other.) 2. The octave must be divided up into twelve steps. 3. All the twelve steps must be equal. (If you take any two notes one step apart, then the frequency ratio between them must always be the same.)

18. There are a number of ways in which composers of symphonies, pop songs and car rental jingles can establish or change the mood of a piece of music. Some of these mood effects rely on the animal responses of human beings and some depend on a shared musical culture between the composer and the listener.

19. done with some background music. Whether it accompanies film or not, the following links between mood and music are fairly reliable: We find increases in speed (tempo), volume and pitch exciting—and decreases in these three have a calming effect. Anticipation is a good mood enhancer, so if the music is quietly repetitive we expect something (frightening or marvelous) to happen soon and the anticipation helps the dramatic effect. Music composed in major keys sounds more self-confident and generally happier than music composed in minor keys.

20. It’s really all about emphasis—and we are all used to small changes in emphasis making a big difference to what we say. For example, the following two sentences have very different meanings because, although I have used all the same words in the same order, I have changed the emphasis by moving the comma, which makes one sentence insulting and the other congratulatory. “I’m not a fool like you, I spend my money wisely.” “I’m not a fool, like you I spend my money wisely.”

And though we may be able to label a smell accurately when we detect it or even describe a smell with reasonable accuracy, we generally find it very difficult to recall a smell ‘into existence’ as Thomas so eloquently puts it.

## The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion

2. Part II is about the second principle of moral psychology, which is that there’s more to morality than harm and fairness. The central metaphor of these four chapters is that the righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors. Secular Western moralities are like cuisines that try to activate just one or two of these receptors—either concerns about harm and suffering, or concerns about fairness and injustice. But people have so many other powerful moral intuitions, such as those related to liberty, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. I’ll explain where these six taste receptors come from, how they form the basis of the world’s many moral cuisines, and why politicians on the right have a built-in advantage when it comes to cooking meals that voters like.

4. Human nature was produced by natural selection working at two levels simultaneously. Individuals compete with individuals within every group, and we are the descendants of primates who excelled at that competition. This gives us the ugly side of our nature, the one that is usually featured in books about our evolutionary origins. We are indeed selfish hypocrites so skilled at putting on a show of virtue that we fool even ourselves. But human nature was also shaped as groups competed with other groups. As Darwin said long ago, the most cohesive and cooperative groups generally beat the groups of selfish individualists. Darwin’s ideas about group selection fell out of favor in the 1960s, but recent discoveries are putting his ideas back into play, and the implications are profound. We’re not always selfish hypocrites. We also have the ability, under special circumstances, to shut down our petty selves and become like cells in a larger body, or like bees in a hive, working for the good of the group. These experiences are often among the most cherished of our lives, although our hivishness can blind us to other moral concerns. Our bee-like nature facilitates altruism, heroism, war, and genocide.

5. How do children come to know right from wrong? Where does morality come from? There are two obvious answers to this question: nature or nurture. If you pick nature, then you’re a nativist. You believe that moral knowledge is native in our minds. It comes preloaded, perhaps in our God-inscribed hearts (as the Bible says), or in our evolved moral emotions (as Darwin argued).2 But if you believe that moral knowledge comes from nurture, then you are an empiricist.3 You believe that children are more or less blank slates at birth (as John Locke said).4 If morality varies around the world and across the centuries, then how could it be innate? Whatever morals we have as adults must have been learned during childhood from our own experience, which includes adults telling us what’s right and wrong. (Empirical means “from observation or experience.”) But this is a false choice, and in 1987 moral psychology was mostly focused on a third answer: rationalism, which says that kids figure out morality for themselves.

7. Children recognize that rules that prevent harm are moral rules, which Turiel defined as rules related to “justice, rights, and welfare pertaining to how people ought to relate to each other.”13 In other words, young children don’t treat all rules the same, as Piaget and Kohlberg had supposed. Kids can’t talk like moral philosophers, but they are busy sorting social information in a sophisticated way. They seem to grasp early on that rules that prevent harm are special, important, unalterable, and universal. And this realization, Turiel said, was the foundation of all moral development. Children construct their moral understanding on the bedrock of the absolute moral truth that harm is wrong. Specific rules may vary across cultures, but in all of the cultures Turiel examined, children still made a distinction between moral rules and conventional rules.

9. all societies must resolve a small set of questions about how to order society, the most important being how to balance the needs of individuals and groups. There seem to be just two primary ways of answering this question. Most societies have chosen the sociocentric answer, placing the needs of groups and institutions first, and subordinating the needs of individuals. In contrast, the individualistic answer places individuals at the center and makes society a servant of the individual.26 The sociocentric answer dominated most of the ancient world, but the individualistic answer became a powerful rival during the Enlightenment. The individualistic answer largely vanquished the sociocentric approach in the twentieth century as individual rights expanded rapidly, consumer culture spread, and the Western world reacted with horror to the evils perpetrated by the ultrasociocentric fascist and communist empires. (European nations with strong social safety nets are not sociocentric on this definition. They just do a very good job of protecting individuals from the vicissitudes of life.)

11. Where does morality come from? The two most common answers have long been that it is innate (the nativist answer) or that it comes from childhood learning (the empiricist answer). In this chapter I considered a third possibility, the rationalist answer, which dominated moral psychology when I entered the field: that morality is self-constructed by children on the basis of their experiences with harm. Kids know that harm is wrong because they hate to be harmed, and they gradually come to see that it is therefore wrong to harm others, which leads them to understand fairness and eventually justice. I explained why I came to reject this answer after conducting research in Brazil and the United States. I concluded instead that: • The moral domain varies by culture. It is unusually narrow in Western, educated, and individualistic cultures. Sociocentric cultures broaden the moral domain to encompass and regulate more aspects of life. • People sometimes have gut feelings—particularly about disgust and disrespect—that can drive their reasoning. Moral reasoning is sometimes a post hoc fabrication. • Morality can’t be entirely self-constructed by children based on their growing understanding of harm. Cultural learning or guidance must play a larger role than rationalist theories had given it. If morality doesn’t come primarily from reasoning, then that leaves some combination of innateness and social learning as the most likely candidates. In the rest of this book I’ll try to explain how morality can be innate (as a set of evolved intuitions) and learned (as children learn to apply those intuitions within a particular culture). We’re born to be righteous, but we have to learn what, exactly, people like us should be righteous about.

12. Damasio’s interpretation was that gut feelings and bodily reactions were necessary to think rationally, and that one job of the vmPFC was to integrate those gut feelings into a person’s conscious deliberations. When you weigh the advantages and disadvantages of murdering your parents … you can’t even do it, because feelings of horror come rushing in through the vmPFC. But Damasio’s patients could think about anything, with no filtering or coloring from their emotions. With the vmPFC shut down, every option at every moment felt as good as every other. The only way to make a decision was to examine each option, weighing the pros and cons using conscious, verbal reasoning.

14. “Reasoning-why,” in contrast, is the process “by which we describe how we think we reached a judgment, or how we think another person could reach that judgment.”34 “Reasoning-why” can occur only for creatures that have language and a need to explain themselves to other creatures. “Reasoning-why” is not automatic; it’s conscious, it sometimes feels like work, and it’s easily disrupted by cognitive load.

15. Yet moral judgments are not subjective statements; they are claims that somebody did something wrong. I can’t call for the community to punish you simply because I don’t like what you’re doing. I have to point to something outside of my own preferences, and that pointing is our moral reasoning. We do moral reasoning not to reconstruct the actual reasons why we ourselves came to a judgment; we reason to find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgment.

In a landmark article, Zajonc urged psychologists to use a dual-process model in which affect or “feeling” is the first process.10 It has primacy both because it happens first (it is part of perception and is therefore extremely fast) and because it is more powerful (it is closely linked to motivation, and therefore it strongly influences behavior). The second process—thinking—is an evolutionarily newer ability, rooted in language and not closely related to motivation. In other words, thinking is the rider; affect is the elephant. The thinking system is not equipped to lead—it simply doesn’t have the power to make things happen—but it can be a useful advisor. Zajonc said that thinking could work independently of feeling in theory, but in practice affective reactions are so fast and compelling that they act like blinders on a horse: they “reduce the universe of alternatives” available to later thinking.11 The rider is an attentive servant, always trying to anticipate the elephant’s next move.

23. Here are four pairs of words. Your job is to look only at the second word in each pair and then categorize it as good or bad: flower–happiness hate–sunshine love–cancer cockroach–lonely It’s absurdly easy, but imagine if I asked you to do it on a computer, where I can flash the first word in each pair for 250 milliseconds (a quarter of a second, just long enough to read it) and then I immediately display the second word. In that case we’d find that it takes you longer to make your value judgment for sunshine and cancer than for happiness and lonely. This effect is called “affective priming” because the first word triggers a flash of affect that primes the mind to go one way or the other.12 It’s like getting the elephant to lean slightly to the right or the left, in anticipation of walking to the right or the left. The flash kicks in within 200 milliseconds, and it lasts for about a second beyond that if there’s no other jolt to back it up.13 If you see the second word within that brief window of time, and if the second word has the same valence, then you’ll be able to respond extra quickly because your mind is already leaning that way. But if the first word primes your mind for a negative evaluation (hate) and I then show you a positive word (sunshine), it’ll take you about 250 milliseconds longer to respond because you have to undo the lean toward negativity. So far this is just a confirmation of Zajonc’s theory about the speed and ubiquity of affect,

24. a big payoff came when social psychologists began using social groups as primes. Would it affect your response speed if I used photographs of black people and white people as the primes? As long as you’re not prejudiced, it won’t affect your reaction times. But if you do prejudge people implicitly (i.e., automatically and unconsciously), then those prejudgments include affective flashes, and those flashes will change your reaction times.

25. The bottom line is that human minds, like animal minds, are constantly reacting intuitively to everything they perceive, and basing their responses on those reactions. Within the first second of seeing, hearing, or meeting another person, the elephant has already begun to lean toward or away, and that lean influences what you think and do next. Intuitions come first.

26. Moral judgment is not a purely cerebral affair in which we weigh concerns about harm, rights, and justice. It’s a kind of rapid, automatic process more akin to the judgments animals make as they move through the world, feeling themselves drawn toward or away from various things. Moral judgment is mostly done by the elephant.

27. 4. PSYCHOPATHS REASON BUT DON’T FEEL Roughly one in a hundred men (and many fewer women) are psychopaths. Most are not violent, but the ones who are commit nearly half of the most serious crimes, such as serial murder, serial rape, and the killing of police officers.28 Robert Hare, a leading researcher, defines psychopathy by two sets of features. There’s the unusual stuff that psychopaths do—impulsive antisocial behavior, beginning in childhood—and there are the moral emotions that psychopaths lack. They feel no compassion, guilt, shame, or even embarrassment, which makes it easy for them to lie, and to hurt family, friends, and animals. Psychopaths do have some emotions. When Hare asked one man if he ever felt his heart pound or stomach churn, he responded: “Of course! I’m not a robot. I really get pumped up when I have sex or when I get into a fight.”29 But psychopaths don’t show emotions that indicate that they care about other people. Psychopaths seem to live in a world of objects, some of which happen to walk around on two legs. One psychopath

29. infants are born with some knowledge of physics and mechanics: they expect that objects will move according to Newton’s laws of motion, and they get startled when psychologists show them scenes that should be physically impossible (such as a toy car seeming to pass through a solid object). Psychologists know this because infants stare longer at impossible scenes than at similar but less magical scenes (seeing the toy car pass just behind the solid object).34 Babies seem to have some innate ability to process events in their physical world—the world of objects.

31. Looking at the discoveries from infants and psychopaths at the same time, it’s clear that moral intuitions emerge very early and are necessary for moral development.38 The ability to reason emerges much later, and when moral reasoning is not accompanied by moral intuition, the results are ugly.

32. Damasio’s studies of brain-damaged patients show that the emotional areas of the brain are the right places to be looking for the foundations of morality, because losing them interferes with moral competence. The case would be even stronger if these areas were active at the right times. Do they become more active just before someone makes a moral judgment or decision? In 1999, Joshua Greene, who was then a graduate student in philosophy at Princeton, teamed up with leading neuroscientist Jonathan Cohen to see what actually happens in the brain as people make moral judgments.

33. Philosophers have long disagreed about whether it’s acceptable to harm one person in order to help or save several people. Utilitarianism is the philosophical school that says you should always aim to bring about the greatest total good, even if a few people get hurt along the way, so if there’s really no other way to save those five lives, go ahead and push. Other philosophers believe that we have duties to respect the rights of individuals, and we must not harm people in our pursuit of other goals, even moral goals such as saving lives. This view is known as deontology (from the Greek root that gives us our word duty). Deontologists talk about high moral principles derived and justified by careful reasoning; they would never agree that these principles are merely post hoc rationalizations of gut feelings.

34. The elephant is far more powerful than the rider, but it is not an absolute dictator. When does the elephant listen to reason? The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people. We are terrible at seeking evidence that challenges our own beliefs, but other people do us this favor, just as we are quite good at finding errors in other people’s beliefs. When discussions are hostile, the odds of change are slight. The elephant leans away from the opponent, and the rider works frantically to rebut the opponent’s charges. But if there is affection, admiration, or a desire to please the other person, then the elephant leans toward that person and the rider tries to find the truth in the other person’s arguments. The elephant may not often change its direction in response to objections from its own rider, but it is easily steered by the mere presence of friendly elephants (that’s the social persuasion link in the social intuitionist model) or by good arguments given to it by the riders of those friendly elephants (that’s the reasoned persuasion link).

35. IN SUM The first principle of moral psychology is Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. In support of this principle, I reviewed six areas of experimental research demonstrating that: • Brains evaluate instantly and constantly (as Wundt and Zajonc said). • Social and political judgments depend heavily on quick intuitive flashes (as Todorov and work with the IAT have shown). • Our bodily states sometimes influence our moral judgments. Bad smells and tastes can make people more judgmental (as can anything that makes people think about purity and cleanliness). • Psychopaths reason but don’t feel (and are severely deficient morally). • Babies feel but don’t reason (and have the beginnings of morality). • Affective reactions are in the right place at the right time in the brain (as shown by Damasio, Greene, and a wave of more recent studies).

Indeed, the process of considering the justifiability of one’s choices may be so prevalent that decision makers not only search for convincing reasons to make a choice when they must explain that choice to others, they search for reasons to convince themselves that they have made the “right” choice.14

39. Mark Leary, a leading researcher on self-consciousness, thought that it made no evolutionary sense for there to be a deep need for self-esteem.15 For millions of years, our ancestors’ survival depended upon their ability to get small groups to include them and trust them, so if there is any innate drive here, it should be a drive to get others to think well of us. Based on his review of the research, Leary suggested that self-esteem is more like an internal gauge, a “sociometer” that continuously measures your value as a relationship partner. Whenever the sociometer needle drops, it triggers an alarm and changes our behavior. As Leary was developing the sociometer theory in the 1990s, he kept meeting people who denied that they were affected by what others thought of them. Do some people truly steer by their own compass? Leary decided to put these self-proclaimed mavericks to the test. First, he had a large group of students rate their self-esteem and how much it depended on what other people think. Then he picked out the few people who—question after question—said they were completely unaffected by the opinions of others, and he invited them to the lab a few weeks later. As a comparison, he also invited people who had consistently said that they were strongly affected by what other people think of them. The test was on. Everyone had to sit alone in a room and talk about themselves for five minutes, speaking into a microphone. At the end of each minute they saw a number flash on a screen in front of them. That number indicated how much another person listening in from another room wanted to interact with them in the next part of the study. With ratings from 1 to 7 (where 7 is best), you can imagine how it would feel to see the numbers drop while you’re talking: 4 … 3 … 2 … 3 … 2. In truth, Leary had rigged it. He gave some people declining ratings while other people got rising ratings: 4 … 5 … 6 … 5 … 6. Obviously it’s more pleasant to see your numbers rise, but would seeing either set of numbers (ostensibly from a complete stranger) change what you believe to be true about yourself, your merits, your self-worth? Not surprisingly, people who admitted that they cared about other people’s opinions had big reactions to the numbers. Their self-esteem sank. But the self-proclaimed mavericks suffered shocks almost as big. They might indeed have steered by their own compass, but they didn’t realize that their compass tracked public opinion, not true north. It was just as Glaucon said. Leary’s conclusion was that “the sociometer operates at a nonconscious and preattentive level to scan the social environment for any and all indications that one’s relational value is low or declining.”16 The sociometer is part of the elephant. Because appearing concerned about other people’s opinions makes us look weak, we (like politicians) often deny that we care about public opinion polls. But the fact is that we care a lot about what others think of us. The only people known to have no sociometer are psychopaths.17

40. In 1960, Peter Wason (creator of the 4-card task from chapter 2) published his report on the “2–4–6 problem.”18 He showed people a series of three numbers and told them that the triplet conforms to a rule. They had to guess the rule by generating other triplets and then asking the experimenter whether the new triplet conformed to the rule. When they were confident they had guessed the rule, they were supposed to tell the experimenter their guess. Suppose a subject first sees 2–4–6. The subject then generates a triplet in response: “4–6–8?” “Yes,” says the experimenter. “How about 120–122–124?” “Yes.” It seemed obvious to most people that the rule was consecutive even numbers. But the experimenter told them this was wrong, so they tested out other rules: “3–5–7?” “Yes.” “What about 35–37–39?” “Yes.” “OK, so the rule must be any series of numbers that rises by two?” “No.” People had little trouble generating new hypotheses about the rule, sometimes quite complex ones. But what they hardly ever did was to test their hypotheses by offering triplets that did not conform to their hypothesis. For example, proposing 2–4–5 (yes) and 2–4–3 (no) would have helped people zero in on the actual rule: any series of ascending numbers. Wason called this phenomenon the confirmation bias, the tendency to seek out and interpret new evidence in ways that confirm what you already think

41. The social psychologist Tom Gilovich studies the cognitive mechanisms of strange beliefs. His simple formulation is that when we want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe it?”28 Then (as Kuhn and Perkins found), we search for supporting evidence, and if we find even a single piece of pseudo-evidence, we can stop thinking. We now have permission to believe. We have a justification, in case anyone asks. In contrast, when we don’t want to believe something, we ask ourselves, “Must I believe it?” Then we search for contrary evidence, and if we find a single reason to doubt the claim, we can dismiss it. You only need one key to unlock the handcuffs of must.

42. WE CAN BELIEVE ALMOST ANYTHING THAT SUPPORTS OUR TEAM Many political scientists used to assume that people vote selfishly, choosing the candidate or policy that will benefit them the most. But decades of research on public opinion have led to the conclusion that self-interest is a weak predictor of policy preferences. Parents of children in public school are not more supportive of government aid to schools than other citizens; young men subject to the draft are not more opposed to military escalation than men too old to be drafted; and people who lack health insurance are not more likely to support government-issued health insurance than people covered by insurance.35 Rather, people care about their groups, whether those be racial, regional, religious, or political. The political scientist Don Kinder summarizes the findings like this: “In matters of public opinion, citizens seem to be asking themselves not ‘What’s in it for me?’ but rather ‘What’s in it for my group?’ ”36 Political opinions function as “badges of social membership.”37 They’re like the array of bumper stickers people put on their cars showing the political causes, universities, and sports teams they support. Our politics is groupish, not selfish.

43. The French cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber recently reviewed the vast research literature on motivated reasoning (in social psychology) and on the biases and errors of reasoning (in cognitive psychology). They concluded that most of the bizarre and depressing research findings make perfect sense once you see reasoning as having evolved not to help us find truth but to help us engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of discussions with other people. As they put it, “skilled arguers … are not after the truth but after arguments supporting their views.”50 This explains why the confirmation bias is so powerful, and so ineradicable.

44. I’m not saying we should all stop reasoning and go with our gut feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes better guides than reasoning for making consumer choices and interpersonal judgments,52 but they are often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law.53 Rather, what I’m saying is that we must be wary of any individual’s ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to “decide” whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn’t very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single neuron. In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth (such as an intelligence agency or a community of scientists) or to produce good public policy (such as a legislature or advisory board).

45. IN SUM The first principle of moral psychology is Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. To demonstrate the strategic functions of moral reasoning, I reviewed five areas of research showing that moral thinking is more like a politician searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth: • We are obsessively concerned about what others think of us, although much of the concern is unconscious and invisible to us. • Conscious reasoning functions like a press secretary who automatically justifies any position taken by the president. • With the help of our press secretary, we are able to lie and cheat often, and then cover it up so effectively that we convince even ourselves. • Reasoning can take us to almost any conclusion we want to reach, because we ask “Can I believe it?” when we want to believe something, but “Must I believe it?” when we don’t want to believe. The answer is almost always yes to the first question and no to the second. • In moral and political matters we are often groupish, rather than selfish. We deploy our reasoning skills to support our team, and to demonstrate commitment to our team. I concluded by warning that the worship of reason, which is sometimes found in philosophical and scientific circles, is a delusion. It is an example of faith in something that does not exist. I urged instead a more intuitionist approach to morality and moral education, one that is more humble about the abilities of individuals, and more attuned to the contexts and social systems that enable people to think and act well. I have tried to make a reasoned case that our moral capacities are best described from an intuitionist perspective. I do not claim to have examined the question from all sides, nor to have offered irrefutable proof. Because of the insurmountable power of the confirmation bias, counterarguments will have to be produced by those who disagree with me. Eventually, if the scientific community works as it is supposed to, the truth will emerge as a large number of flawed and limited minds battle it out. This concludes Part I of this book, which was about the first principle of moral psychology: Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. To explain this principle I used the metaphor of the mind as a rider (reasoning) on an elephant (intuition), and I said that the rider’s function is to serve the elephant. Reasoning matters, particularly because reasons do sometimes influence other people, but most of the action in moral psychology is in the intuitions.

Joe Henrich, Steve Heine, and Ara Norenzayan published a profoundly important article titled “The Weirdest People in the World?”2 The authors pointed out that nearly all research in psychology is conducted on a very small subset of the human population: people from cultures that are Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (forming the acronym WEIRD). They then reviewed dozens of studies showing that WEIRD people are statistical outliers; they are the least typical, least representative people you could study if you want to make generalizations about human nature.

48. A dictum of cultural psychology is that “culture and psyche make each other up.”9 In other words, you can’t study the mind while ignoring culture, as psychologists usually do, because minds function only once they’ve been filled out by a particular culture. And you can’t study culture while ignoring psychology, as anthropologists usually do, because social practices and institutions (such as initiation rites, witchcraft, and religion) are to some extent shaped by concepts and desires rooted deep within the human mind, which explains why they often take similar forms on different continents.

49. According to one of the leading autism researchers, Simon Baron-Cohen, there are in fact two spectra, two dimensions on which we can place each person: empathizing and systemizing. Empathizing is “the drive to identify another person’s emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion.”13 If you prefer fiction to nonfiction, or if you often enjoy conversations about people you don’t know, you are probably above average on empathizing. Systemizing is “the drive to analyse the variables in a system, to derive the underlying rules that govern the behaviour of the system.”14 If you are good at reading maps and instruction manuals, or if you enjoy figuring out how machines work, you are probably above average on systemizing.

51. As the neuroscientist Gary Marcus explains, “Nature bestows upon the newborn a considerably complex brain, but one that is best seen as prewired—flexible and subject to change—rather than hardwired, fixed, and immutable.”2 To replace wiring diagrams, Marcus suggests a better analogy: The brain is like a book, the first draft of which is written by the genes during fetal development. No chapters are complete at birth, and some are just rough outlines waiting to be filled in during childhood. But not a single chapter—be it on sexuality, language, food preferences, or morality—consists of blank pages on which a society can inscribe any conceivable set of words. Marcus’s analogy leads to the best definition of innateness I have ever seen: Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.… “Built-in” does not mean unmalleable; it means “organized in advance of experience.”3

53. The Care/harm foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of caring for vulnerable children. It makes us sensitive to signs of suffering and need; it makes us despise cruelty and want to care for those who are suffering. • The Fairness/cheating foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of reaping the rewards of cooperation without getting exploited. It makes us sensitive to indications that another person is likely to be a good (or bad) partner for collaboration and reciprocal altruism. It makes us want to shun or punish cheaters. • The Loyalty/betrayal foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forming and maintaining coalitions. It makes us sensitive to signs that another person is (or is not) a team player. It makes us trust and reward such people, and it makes us want to hurt, ostracize, or even kill those who betray us or our group. • The Authority/subversion foundation evolved in response to the adaptive challenge of forging relationships that will benefit us within social hierarchies. It makes us sensitive to signs of rank or status, and to signs that other people are (or are not) behaving properly, given their position. • The Sanctity/degradation foundation evolved initially in response to the adaptive challenge of the omnivore’s dilemma, and then to the broader challenge of living in a world of pathogens and parasites. It includes the behavioral immune system, which can make us wary of a diverse array of symbolic objects and threats. It makes it possible for people to invest objects with irrational and extreme values—both positive and negative—which are important for binding groups together. I showed how the two ends of the political spectrum rely upon each foundation in different ways, or to different degrees. It appears that the left relies primarily on the Care and Fairness foundations, whereas the right uses all five. If this is true, then is the morality of the left like the food served in The True Taste restaurant? Does left-wing morality activate just one or two taste receptors, whereas right-wing morality engages a broader palate, including loyalty, authority, and sanctity? And if so, does that give conservative politicians a broader variety of ways to connect with voters?

55. the third and final principle of moral psychology: Morality binds and blinds. I will suggest that human nature is mostly selfish, but with a groupish overlay that resulted from the fact that natural selection works at multiple levels simultaneously. Individuals compete with individuals, and that competition rewards selfishness—which includes some forms of strategic cooperation (even criminals can work together to further their own interests).7 But at the same time, groups compete with groups, and that competition favors groups composed of true team players—those who are willing to cooperate and work for the good of the group, even when they could do better by slacking, cheating, or leaving the group.8 These two processes pushed human nature in different directions and gave us the strange mix of selfishness and selflessness that we know today.

56. The biologists Bert Hölldobler and E. O. Wilson summarize the recent finding that ultrasociality (also called “eusociality”)45 is found among a few species of shrimp, aphids, thrips, and beetles, as well as among wasps, bees, ants, and termites: In all the known [species that] display the earliest stages of eusociality, their behavior protects a persistent, defensible resource from predators, parasites, or competitors. The resource is invariably a nest plus dependable food within foraging range of the nest inhabitants.46 Hölldobler and Wilson give supporting roles to two other factors: the need to feed offspring over an extended period (which gives an advantage to species that can recruit siblings or males to help out Mom) and intergroup conflict.

Like bees, our ancestors were (1) territorial creatures with a fondness for defensible nests (such as caves) who (2) gave birth to needy offspring that required enormous amounts of care, which had to be given while (3) the group was under threat from neighboring groups. For hundreds of thousands of years, therefore, conditions were in place that pulled for the evolution of ultrasociality, and as a result, we are the only ultrasocial primate.

Many people assume that language was our Rubicon, but language became possible only after our ancestors got shared intentionality. Tomasello notes that a word is not a relationship between a sound and an object. It is an agreement among people who share a joint representation of the things in their world, and who share a set of conventions for communicating with each other about those things.

59. Our ancestors first began to diverge from the common ancestor we share with chimps and bonobos between 5 million and 7 million years ago. For the next few million years, there were many species of hominids walking around on two legs in Africa. But judging from their brain size and their limited use of tools, these creatures (including australopithecines such as “Lucy”) are better thought of as bipedal apes than as early humans.60 Then, beginning around 2.4 million years ago, hominids with larger brains begin to appear in the fossil record. These were the first members of the genus Homo, including Homo habilis, so named because these creatures were “handy men” compared to their ancestors. They left behind a profusion of simple stone tools known as the Oldowan tool kit. These tools, mostly just sharp flakes they had knocked off larger stones, helped Homo habilis to cut and scrape meat off carcasses killed by other animals. Homo habilis was not much of a hunter. FIGURE 9.1. Time line of major events in human evolution. MYA = million years ago; KYA = thousand years ago. Dates drawn from Potts and Sloan 2010; Richerson and Boyd 2005; and Tattersall 2009. Then, beginning around 1.8 million years ago, some hominids in East Africa began making new and more finely crafted tools, known as the Acheulean tool kit.61 The main tool was a teardrop-shaped hand axe, and its symmetry and careful crafting jump out at us as something new under the sun, something made by minds like ours (see figure 9.2). This seems like a promising place to start talking about cumulative culture. But here’s the weird thing: Acheulean tools are nearly identical everywhere, from Africa to Europe to Asia, for more than a million years. There’s hardly any variation, which suggests that the knowledge of how to make these tools may not have been passed on culturally. Rather, the knowledge of how to make these tools may have become innate, just as the “knowledge” of how to build a dam is innate in beavers.62 It’s only around 600,000 or 700,000 years ago that we begin to see creatures who may have crossed over. The first hominids with brains as large as ours begin appearing in Africa and then Europe. FIGURE 9.2. Acheulean hand axe. (photo credit 9.1) They are known collectively as Homo heidelbergensis, and they were the ancestors of Neanderthals as well as of us. At their campsites we find the first clear evidence of hearths, and of spears. The oldest known spears were just sharpened sticks, but later they became sharp stone points attached to wooden shafts and balanced for accurate throwing. These people made complex weapons and then worked together to hunt and kill large animals, which they brought back to a central campsite to be butchered, cooked, and shared.63 Homo heidelbergensis is therefore our best candidate for Rubicon crosser.64 These people had cumulative culture, teamwork, and a division of labor. They must have had shared intentionality, including at least some rudimentary moral matrix that helped them work together and then share the fruits of their labor. By crossing over, they transformed not just the course of human evolution but the very nature of the evolutionary process. From that point onward, people lived in an environment that was increasingly of their own making.

60. If cultural innovations (such as keeping cattle) can lead to genetic responses (such as adult lactose tolerance), then might cultural innovations related to morality have led to genetic responses as well? Yes. Richerson and Boyd argue that gene-culture coevolution helped to move humanity up from the small-group sociability of other primates to the tribal ultrasociality that is found today in all human societies.67

61. According to their “tribal instincts hypothesis,” human groups have always been in competition to some degree with neighboring groups. The groups that figured out (or stumbled upon) cultural innovations that helped them cooperate and cohere in groups larger than the family tended to win these competitions (just as Darwin said). Among the most important such innovations is the human love of using symbolic markers to show our group memberships. From the tattoos and face piercings used among Amazonian tribes through the male circumcision required of Jews to the tattoos and facial piercings used by punks in the United Kingdom, human beings take extraordinary, costly, and sometimes painful steps to make their bodies advertise their group memberships. This practice surely started modestly, perhaps just with colored powders for body painting.68 But however it began, groups that built on it and invented more permanent markers found a way to forge a sense of “we” that extended beyond kinship. We trust and cooperate more readily with people who look and sound like us.69 We expect them to share our values and norms. And once some groups developed the cultural innovation of prototribalism, they changed the environment within which genetic evolution took place. As Richerson and Boyd explain: Such environments favored the evolution of a suite of new social instincts suited to life in such groups, including a psychology which “expects” life to be structured by moral norms and is designed to learn and internalize such norms; new emotions such as shame and guilt, which increase the chance that the norms are followed, and a psychology which “expects” the social world to be divided into symbolically marked groups.70 In such prototribal societies, individuals who found it harder to play along, to restrain their antisocial impulses, and to conform to the most important collective norms would not have been anyone’s top choice when it came time to choose partners for hunting, foraging, or mating. In particular, people who were violent would have been shunned, punished, or in extreme cases killed. This process has been described as “self-domestication.”71 The ancestors of dogs, cats, and pigs got less aggressive as they were domesticated and shaped for partnership with human beings. Only the friendliest ones approached human settlements in the first place; they volunteered to become the ancestors of today’s pets and farm animals. In a similar way, early humans domesticated themselves when they began to select friends and partners based on their ability to live within the tribe’s moral matrix. In fact, our brains, bodies, and behavior show many of the same signs of domestication that are found in our domestic animals: smaller teeth, smaller body, reduced aggression, and greater playfulness, carried on even into adulthood.72 The reason is that domestication generally takes traits that disappear at the end of childhood and keeps them turned on for life. Domesticated animals (including humans) are more childlike, sociable, and gentle than their wild ancestors. These tribal instincts are a kind of overlay, a set of groupish emotions and mental mechanisms laid down over our older and more selfish primate nature.

62. A second study done with chickens shows that group selection can produce equally dramatic results. If you want to increase egg output, common sense tells you to breed only the hens that lay the most eggs. But the reality of the egg industry is that hens live crammed together into cages, and the best laying hens tend to be the more aggressive, dominant hens. Therefore, if you use individual selection (breeding only the most productive hens), total productivity actually goes down because aggressive behavior—including killing and cannibalism—goes up. FIGURE 9.3. Lyudmila Trut with Pavlik, a forty-second generation decendant of Belyaev’s original study. (photo credit 9.2) In the 1980s the geneticist William Muir used group selection to get around this problem.80 He worked with cages containing twelve hens each, and he simply picked the cages that produced the most eggs in each generation. Then he bred all of the hens in those cages to produce the next generation. Within just three generations, aggression levels plummeted. By the sixth generation, the death rate fell from the horrific baseline of 67 percent to a mere 8 percent. Total eggs produced per hen jumped from 91 to 237, mostly because the hens started living longer, but also because they laid more eggs per day. The group-selected hens were more productive than were those subjected to individual-level selection. They also actually looked like the pictures of chickens you see in children’s books—plump and well-feathered, in contrast to the battered, beaten-up, and partially defeathered hens that resulted from individual-level selection.

63. in recent years new scholarship has emerged that elevates the role of groups in evolutionary thinking. Natural selection works at multiple levels simultaneously, sometimes including groups of organisms. I can’t say for sure that human nature was shaped by group selection—there are scientists whose views I respect on both sides of the debate. But as a psychologist studying morality, I can say that multilevel selection would go a long way toward explaining why people are simultaneously so selfish and so groupish.91

64. We humans have a dual nature—we are selfish primates who long to be a part of something larger and nobler than ourselves. We are 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee.93 If you take that claim metaphorically, then the groupish and hivish things that people do will make a lot more sense. It’s almost as though there’s a switch in our heads that activates our hivish potential when conditions are just right.

65. What can leaders do to create more hivish organizations? The first step is to stop thinking so much about leadership. One group of scholars has used multilevel selection to think about what leadership really is. Robert Hogan, Robert Kaiser, and Mark van Vugt argue that leadership can only be understood as the complement of followership.45 Focusing on leadership alone is like trying to understand clapping by studying only the left hand. They point out that leadership is not even the more interesting hand; it’s no puzzle to understand why people want to lead. The real puzzle is why people are willing to follow. These scholars note that people evolved to live in groups of up to 150 that were relatively egalitarian and wary of alpha males (as Chris Boehm said).46 But we also evolved the ability to rally around leaders when our group is under threat or is competing with other groups.

66. Create healthy competition among teams, not individuals. As McNeill said, soldiers don’t risk their lives for their country or for the army; they do so for their buddies in the same squad or platoon. Studies show that intergroup competition increases love of the in-group far more than it increases dislike of the out-group.53 Intergroup competitions, such as friendly rivalries between corporate divisions, or intramural sports competitions, should have a net positive effect on hivishness and social capital. But pitting individuals against each other in a competition for scarce resources (such as bonuses) will destroy hivishness, trust, and morale.

67. Why do the students sing, chant, dance, sway, chop, and stomp so enthusiastically during the game? Showing support for their football team may help to motivate the players, but is that the function of these behaviors? Are they done in order to achieve victory? No. From a Durkheimian perspective these behaviors serve a very different function, and it is the same one that Durkheim saw at work in most religious rituals: the creation of a community.

68. Religions are social facts. Religion cannot be studied in lone individuals any more than hivishness can be studied in lone bees. Durkheim’s definition of religion makes its binding function clear: A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.3

69. The horror of 9/11 motivated several of these scientists to write books, and between 2004 and 2007, so many such books were published that a movement was born: the New Atheism. The titles were combative. The first one out was Sam Harris’s The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason, followed by Richard Dawkins’s The God Delusion, Daniel Dennett’s Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, and, with the most explicit title of all, Christopher Hitchens’s God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. These four authors are known as the four horsemen of New Atheism, but I’m going to set Hitchens aside because he is a journalist whose book made no pretense to be anything other than a polemical diatribe. The other three authors, however, are men of science: Harris was a graduate student in neuroscience at the time, Dawkins is a biologist, and Dennett is a philosopher who has written widely on evolution. These three authors claimed to speak for science and to exemplify the values of science—particularly its open-mindedness and its insistence that claims be grounded in reason and empirical evidence, not faith and emotion. I also group these three authors together because they offer similar definitions of religion, all focusing on belief in supernatural agents.

70. trying to understand the persistence and passion of religion by studying beliefs about God is like trying to understand the persistence and passion of college football by studying the movements of the ball.

72. The New Atheist model is based on the Platonic rationalist view of the mind, which I introduced in chapter 2: Reason is (or at least could be) the charioteer guiding the passions (the horses). So as long as reason has the proper factual beliefs (and has control of the unruly passions), the chariot will go in the right direction. In chapters 2, 3, and 4, however, I reviewed a great deal of evidence against the Platonic view and in favor of a Humean view in which reason (the rider) is a servant of the intuitions (the elephant).

75. Political theorists since Marx had long assumed that people chose ideologies to further their self-interest. The rich and powerful want to preserve and conserve; the peasants and workers want to change things (or at least they would if their consciousness could be raised and they could see their self-interest properly, said the Marxists). But even though social class may once have been a good predictor of ideology, that link has been largely broken in modern times, when the rich go both ways (industrialists mostly right, tech billionaires mostly left) and so do the poor (rural poor mostly right, urban poor mostly left). And when political scientists looked into it, they found that self-interest does a remarkably poor job of predicting political attitudes.

77. Even though the effects of any single gene are tiny, these findings are important because they illustrate one sort of pathway from genes to politics: the genes (collectively) give some people brains that are more (or less) reactive to threats, and that produce less (or more) pleasure when exposed to novelty, change, and new experiences.19 These are two of the main personality factors that have consistently been found to distinguish liberals and conservatives.
   - Location: 4645-4649
   - Page: 325

78. Step 2: Traits Guide Children Along Different Paths Where do our personalities come from? To answer that question, we need to distinguish among three different levels of personality, according to a useful theory from psychologist Dan McAdams.21 The lowest level of our personalities, which he calls “dispositional traits,” are the sorts of broad dimensions of personality that show themselves in many different situations and are fairly consistent from childhood through old age. These are traits such as threat sensitivity, novelty seeking, extraversion, and conscientiousness. These traits are not mental modules that some people have and others lack; they’re more like adjustments to dials on brain systems that everyone has.

79. The second level is our “characteristic adaptations.” These are traits that emerge as we grow. They are called adaptations because people develop them in response to the specific environments and challenges that they happen to face.

80. Step 3: People Construct Life Narratives The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor. Everyone loves a good story; every culture bathes its children in stories. Among the most important stories we know are stories about ourselves, and these “life narratives” are McAdams’s third level of personality. McAdams’s greatest contribution to psychology has been his insistence that psychologists connect their quantitative data (about the two lower levels, which we assess with questionnaires and reaction-time measures) to a more qualitative understanding of the narratives people create to make sense of their lives. These narratives are not necessarily true stories—they are simplified and selective reconstructions of the past, often connected to an idealized vision of the future. But even though life narratives are to some degree post hoc fabrications, they still influence people’s behavior, relationships, and mental health.

82. conservatives generally take a very different view of human nature. They believe that people need external structures or constraints in order to behave well, cooperate, and thrive. These external constraints include laws, institutions, customs, traditions, nations, and religions. People who hold this “constrained”41 view are therefore very concerned about the health and integrity of these “outside-the-mind” coordination devices. Without them, they believe, people will begin to cheat and behave selfishly. Without them, social capital will rapidly decay.

83. Counterpoint #1: Markets Are Miraculous In 2007, David Goldhill’s father was killed by an infection he caught while in the hospital. In trying to make sense of this unnecessary death, Goldhill began to read about the American health care system, which kills about 100,000 people annually by such accidental infections. He learned that the death rate can be cut by two-thirds when hospitals follow a simple checklist of sanitary procedures, but most hospitals don’t adopt the checklist. Goldhill, a businessman (and Democrat), wondered how it was possible for any organization to pass up a simple measure that yielded such massive payoffs. In the business world, such inefficiency would soon lead to bankruptcy. As he learned more and more about the health care system, he discovered just how bad things get when goods and services are provided without a properly functioning market. In 2009, Goldhill published a provocative essay in The Atlantic titled “How American Health Care Killed My Father”:64 One of his main points was the absurdity of using insurance to pay for routine purchases. Normally we buy insurance to cover the risk of a catastrophic loss. We enter an insurance pool with other people to spread the risk around, and we hope never to collect a penny. We handle routine expenses ourselves, seeking out the highest quality for the lowest price. We would never file a claim on our car insurance to pay for an oil change. The next time you go to the supermarket, look closely at a can of peas. Think about all the work that went into it—the farmers, truckers, and supermarket employees, the miners and metalworkers who made the can—and think how miraculous it is that you can buy this can for under a dollar. At every step of the way, competition among suppliers rewarded those whose innovations shaved a penny off the cost of getting that can to you. If God is commonly thought to have created the world and then arranged it for our benefit, then the free market (and its invisible hand) is a pretty good candidate for being a god. You can begin to understand why libertarians sometimes have a quasi-religious faith in free markets. Now let’s do the devil’s work and spread chaos throughout the marketplace. Suppose that one day all prices are removed from all products in the supermarket. All labels too, beyond a simple description of the contents, so you can’t compare products from different companies. You just take whatever you want, as much as you want, and you bring it up to the register. The checkout clerk scans in your food insurance card and helps you fill out your itemized claim. You pay a flat fee of $10 and go home with your groceries. A month later you get a bill informing you that your food insurance company will pay the supermarket for most of the remaining cost, but you’ll have to send in a check for an additional $15. It might sound like a bargain to get a cartload of food for $25, but you’re really paying your grocery bill every month when you fork over $2,000 for your food insurance premium. Under such a system, there is little incentive for anyone to find innovative ways to reduce the cost of food or increase its quality. The supermarkets get paid by the insurers, and the insurers get their premiums from you. The cost of food insurance begins to rise as supermarkets stock only the foods that net them the highest insurance payments, not the foods that deliver value to you. As the cost of food insurance rises, many people can no longer afford it. Liberals (motivated by Care) push for a new government program to buy food insurance for the poor and the elderly. But once the government becomes the major purchaser of food, then success in the supermarket and food insurance industries depends primarily on maximizing yield from government payouts. Before you know it, that can of peas costs the government $30, and all of us are paying 25 percent of our paychecks in taxes just to cover the cost of buying groceries for each other at hugely inflated costs.

84. In Part I, I presented the first principle of moral psychology: Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. I explained how I came to develop the social intuitionist model, and I used the model to challenge the “rationalist delusion.” The heroes of this part were David Hume (for helping us escape from rationalism and into intuitionism) and Glaucon (for showing us the overriding importance of reputation and other external constraints for creating moral order). If you bring one thing home from this part of the trip, may I suggest that it be the image of yourself—and everyone else around you—as being a small rider on a very large elephant. Thinking in this way can make you more patient with other people. When you catch yourself making up ridiculous post hoc arguments, you might be slower to dismiss other people just because you can so easily refute their arguments. The action in moral psychology is not really in the pronouncements of the rider.

85. The second part of our tour explored the second principle of moral psychology: There’s more to morality than harm and fairness. I recounted my time in India, and how it helped me to step out of my moral matrix and perceive additional moral concerns. I offered the metaphor that the righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors. I presented Moral Foundations Theory and the research that my colleagues and I have conducted at YourMorals.org on the psychology of liberals and conservatives. The heroes of this part were Richard Shweder (for broadening our understanding of the moral domain) and Emile Durkheim (for showing us why many people, particularly social conservatives, value the binding foundations of loyalty, authority, and sanctity).

86. If you take home one souvenir from this part of the tour, may I suggest that it be a suspicion of moral monists. Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people, times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges are variable. Our minds contain a toolbox of psychological systems, including the six moral foundations, which can be used to meet those challenges and construct effective moral communities. You don’t need to use all six, and there may be certain organizations or subcultures that can thrive with just one. But anyone who tells you that all societies, in all eras, should be using one particular moral matrix, resting on one particular configuration of moral foundations, is a fundamentalist of one sort or another.

87. In the third part of our tour I presented the principle that morality binds and blinds. We are products of multilevel selection, which turned us into Homo duplex. We are selfish and we are groupish. We are 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee. I suggested that religion played a crucial role in our evolutionary history—our religious minds coevolved with our religious practices to create ever-larger moral communities, particularly after the advent of agriculture. I described how political teams form, and why some people gravitate to the left, others to the right. The heroes of this part were Charles Darwin (for his theory of evolution, including multilevel selection) and Emile Durkheim (for showing us that we are Homo duplex, with part of our nature forged, perhaps, by group-level selection).

## Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences

The size of a human cell is to that of a person as a person’s size is to that of Rhode Island. Likewise, a virus is to a person as a person is to the earth; an atom is to a person as a person is to the earth’s orbit around the sun; and a proton is to a person as a person is to the distance to Alpha Centauri.

3. The surprising likelihood of coincidence is illustrated by the following well-known result in probability Since a year has 366 days (if you count February 29), there would have to be 367 people gathered together in order for us to be absolutely certain that at least two people in the group have the same birthday. Why? Now, what if we were content to be just 50 percent certain of this? That is, how many people would there have to be in a group in order for the probability to be half that at least two people in it have the same birthday? An initial guess might be 183, about half of 365. The surprising answer is that there need be only twenty-three. Stated differently, fully half of the time that twenty-three randomly selected people are gathered together, two or more of them will share a birthday.

4. The moral, again, is that some unlikely event is likely to occur, whereas it’s much less likely that a particular one will. Martin Gardner, the mathematics writer, illustrates the distinction between general and specific occurrences by means of a spinner with the twenty-six letters of the alphabet on it. If the spinner is spun one hundred times and the letters recorded, the probability that the word CAT or WARM will appear is very small, but the probability of some word’s appearing is high. Since I brought up the topic of astrology, Gardner’s examples of the first letters of the names of the months and the planets are particularly appropriate. The months—JFMAMJJASOND—give us JASON; the planets—MVEMJSUNP—spell SUN. Significant? No.

## The Illusion of Conscious Will
**Author:** Daniel M. Wegner

### Highlights (24)

1. Yes, we feel that we consciously cause what we do; and yes, our actions happen to us. Rather than opposites, conscious will and psychological determinism can be friends. Such friendship comes from realizing that the feeling of conscious will is created by the mind and brain just as human actions themselves are created by the mind and brain. The answer to the question of conscious will, then, may involve exploring how the mechanisms of the human mind create the experience of will. And the experience of conscious will that is created in this way need not be a mere epiphenomenon. Rather than a ghost in the machine, the experience of conscious will is a feeling that helps us to appreciate and remember our authorship of the things our minds and bodies do.

2. If psychological and neural mechanisms are responsible for human behavior, why does it feel as though we are consciously causing the things we do? It turns out there is a world of scientific research on this question.
   - Location: 68-69
   - Page: 5

3. In these pages, this research is approached from several directions. We look at the conditions that influence illusions of the experience of will— the cases when people feel they are willing an act that they in fact are not doing, or when they feel they are not willing an act that they indeed are doing. We explore conscious will in settings such as hypnosis, Ouija board spelling, automatic writing, and facilitated communication. We examine, too, such unusual phenomena as spirit possession, dissociative identity disorder, and trance channeling, to grasp some of the extreme transformations of the experience of will. Psychological disorders—some caused by detectable brain damage and others, such as schizophrenia, by more subtle processes are examined also, to understand how the experience of conscious will is modified in these conditions. The goal of this book is to put conscious will into perspective as a topic of psychological study. To do this, we need to understand how conscious will might be an illusion, a feeling that comes and goes independent of any actual causal relationship between our thoughts and our actions.

4. So, here you are reading a book on conscious will. How could this have happened? One way to explain it would be to examine the causes of your behavior. A team of scientific psychologists could study your reported thoughts, emotions, and motives, your genetics and your history of learning, experience, and development, your social situation and culture, your memories and reaction times, your physiology and neuroanatomy, and lots of other things as well. If they somehow had access to all the information they could ever want, the assumption of psychology is that they could uncover the mechanisms that give rise to all your behavior and so could certainly explain why you picked up this book at this moment.1 However, another way to explain the fact of your reading this book is just to say that you decided to pick up the book and begin reading. You consciously willed what you are doing

5. Pierre Simon Laplace (1749-1827) in his Philosophical Essay on Probabilities (1814): “An intellect which at any given moment knew all the forces that animate Nature and the mutual positions of the beings that comprise it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit its data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest atom: for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain; and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.” It turns out that this “single formula” is so complex that the project of understanding the causation of even a single human action is a vast challenge to scientists, perhaps an impossible one. However, we’re talking here about an ideal of science, not a practical project.

6. These two explanations are both appealing but in different ways. The scientific explanation accounts for behavior as a mechanism and appeals to that part of us that knows how useful science is for understanding the world. It would be wonderful if we could understand people in just the same way. The conscious will explanation, on the other hand, has a much deeper grip on our intuition. We each have a profound sense that we consciously will much of what we do, and we experience ourselves willing our actions many times a day.

   - Location: 126-128
   - Page: 9

8. Conscious will is usually understood in one of two major ways. It is common to talk about conscious will as something that is experienced when we perform an action—actions feel willed or not, and this feeling of voluntariness or doing a thing “on purpose” is an indication of conscious will. It is also common, however, to speak of conscious will as a force of mind, a name for the causal link between our minds and our actions. One might assume that the experience of consciously willing an action and the causation of the action by the person’s conscious mind are the same thing. As it turns out, however, they are entirely distinct, and the tendency to confuse them is the source of the illusion of conscious will that this book is about. So, to begin, we’ll need to look into each in turn, first examining will as an experience and then considering will as a causal force.

9. Without an experience of willing, even actions that look entirely voluntary from the outside still fall short of qualifying as truly willed. Intentions, plans, and other thoughts can be experienced, and still the action isn’t willed if the person says it was not.

10. Consciously willing an action requires a feeling of doing (Ansfield and Wegner 1996),
   - Location: 159-159

11. The experience of will that is so essential for the occurrence of consciously willed action does not always accompany actions that appear by other indications to be willed. Consider, for instance, the case of people who have alien hand syndrome, a neuropsychological disorder in which a person experiences one hand as operating with a mind of its own. One such per-son was the character played by Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove (fig. 1.1), who couldn’t control one hand and found it alternately steering his wheelchair astray and gesturing a Nazi salute. Alien hand patients typically experience one hand as acting autonomously. They do not experience willing its actions and may find it moving at cross-purposes with their conscious intention. This syndrome is often linked with damage to the middle of the frontal lobe on the side of the brain opposite the affected hand (Gasquoine 1993), and in some people the difficulty can come and go over time (Leiguarda et al. 1993). Banks and colleagues (1989, 456) report an alien hand patient whose “left hand would tenaciously grope for and grasp any nearby object, pick and pull at her clothes, and even grasp her throat during sleep. . . . She slept with the arm tied to prevent nocturnal misbehavior. She never denied that her left arm and hand belonged to her, although she did refer to her limb as though it were an autonomous entity.” Should the alien hand’s movements be classed as willed or unwilled? On the one hand (pun couldn’t be helped), the alien hand seems to do some fairly complicated things, acts we might class as willful and voluntary if we were just watching and hadn’t learned of the patient’s lamentable loss of control. In the case of another patient, for example, “While playing checkers on one occasion, the left hand made a move he did not wish to make, and he corrected the move with the right hand; however, the left hand, to the patient’s frustration, repeated the false move. On other occasions, he turned the pages of the book with one hand while the other tried to close it; he shaved with the right hand while the left one unzipped his jacket; he tried to soap a washcloth while the left hand kept putting the soap back in the dish; and he tried to open a closet with the right hand while the left one closed it” (Banks et al. 1989, 457). By the looks of it, the alien hand is quite willful. On the other hand (as the pun drags on), however, the patient does not experience these actions as consciously willed. One patient described the experience as a feeling that “someone from the moon” was controlling her hand (Geschwind et al. 1995, 803).

12. Hypnotic involuntariness thus provides an example of the lack of experience of will that is even more perplexing than alien hand syndrome. With alien hand, the person simply doesn’t know what the hand will do, but with hypnosis, conscious will is lacking even when knowledge of the action is present. And without the experience of willing, even this foreknowledge of the action seems insufficient to move the action into the “consciously willed” category. If it doesn’t feel as though you did it, then it doesn’t seem that the will was operating.

13. We should not fail to notice here, however, the other special quadrant of the table—cases of the illusion of control . Ellen Langer (1975) used this term to describe instances in which people have the feeling they are doing something when they actually are not doing anything.4 When does this happen? The last time it happened to me was when I was shopping in a toy store with my family one Saturday. While my kids were taking a complete inventory of the stock, I eased up to a video game display and started fiddling with the joystick. A little monkey on the screen was eagerly hopping over barrels as they rolled toward him, and I got quite involved in moving him along and making him hop, until the phrase “Start Game” popped into view. I was under the distinct impression that I had started some time ago, but in fact I had been “playing” during a pre-game demo. Duped perhaps by the wobbly joystick and my unfamiliarity with the game, I had been fiddling for nothing, the victim of an illusion of control. And, indeed, when I started playing the game, I immediately noticed the difference. But for a while there, I was oblivious to my own irrelevance. I thought I was doing something that I really didn’t do at all.

14. the automatisms and illusions of control that lie off this diagonal remind us that action and the feeling of doing are not locked together inevitably.
   - Location: 271-272

15. The processes of mind that produce the experience of will may be quite distinct from the processes of mind that produce the action itself. As soon as we accept the idea that the will should be understood as an experience of the person who acts, we realize that conscious will is not inherent in action—there are actions that have it and actions that don’t.
   - Location: 272-275
   - Page: 18

16. Will is not only an experience; it is also a force. Because of this, it is tempting to think that the conscious experience of will is a direct perception of the force of will.
   - Location: 287-288
   - Page: 19

17. Just as a dish might have hotness or an automobile might have the property of being red, a person seems to have will, a quality of power that causes his or her actions. The force may be with us. Such will can be strong or weak and so can serve to explain things such as one person’s steely persistence in the attempt to dig a swimming pool in the backyard, for example, or another person’s knee-buckling weakness for chocolate. The notion of strength of will has been an important intuitive explanation of human behavior since the ancients (Charleton 1988), and it has served throughout the history of psychology as the centerpiece of the psychology of will. The classic partition of the mind into three functions includes cognition, emotion, and conation —the will or volitional component (e.g., James 1890).
   - Location: 293-298

18. The will in this traditional way of thinking is an explanatory entity of the first order. In other words, it explains lots of things but nothing explains it.
   - Location: 299-300
   - Page: 20

19. Intention is normally understood as an idea of what one is going to do that appears in consciousness just before one does it. This is the thought that people usually associate most strongly with causing the action.
   - Location: 400-401
   - Page: 27

20. We usually expect that a person who waters the plants has yet other conscious thoughts that are relevant to the watering. This person seems to have beliefs (“The plants need water,” “This is water in my watering can”), for example, because it usually takes some understanding of the world and of the nature of the action to completely characterize what is going to be done. Such world knowledge seems particularly necessary for doing things that are extended or consequential (Danto 1963; Goldman 1970; Melden 1961). It doesn’t take much in the way of knowledge about the world to wiggle your ears or bend a finger, but you must have a set of relevant beliefs and understandings about how your basic bodily movements will yield more distant effects if you want to do anything beyond wiggling and bending. Basic bodily actions thus seem to be nested within higher-level actions (“I bent my arm” is part of “I tilted the watering can,” which is part of “I watered the plant”), even though all of them may be happening at once. We can describe an action at any of these different levels (Vallacher and Wegner 1985; 1987). However, at each higher level, more needs to be known and believed about the context in which the basic bodily movement is occurring for that action to be understood. The more we can imagine that an agent knows or believes about the world, the more extended and involved are the actions and goals we can imagine the agent pursuing.
   - Location: 408-417
   - Page: 27

21. As a rule, the perception of human causal agency also involves understanding the person’s desire (“I’m watering these plants in hopes of winning the All Green Thumbs Award again this year”). Desires are not always the same as intentions because they are sometimes descriptive of future circumstances that cannot be fulfilled with this act alone.
   - Location: 418-420
   - Page: 28

22. One other category of thoughts relevant to conscious will also can be important: plans . In a way, a plan is simply an intention that appears in mind some significant interval before the action.
   - Location: 425-426
   - Page: 28

23. Conscious plans to act do not seem to compel behavior in the sense that once the plan is in place the behavior always occurs. Instead, plans just prepare the way. Often, they involve detailed specifications of how to act—the means or subacts of an action—and they thus make it more likely that when a situation arises in which the behavior is appropriate, the behavior can occur successfully. Intentions that occur just prior to action, in contrast, do seem to compel the action. This is the basic phenomenon of the experience of will.
   - Location: 432-436
   - Page: 29

24. Causal agency, in sum, is an important way in which people understand action, particularly human action. In the process of understanding actions performed by oneself or others, the person will appreciate information about intentions, beliefs, desires, and plans, and will use this information in discerning just what the agent is doing. The intuitive appeal of the idea of conscious will can be traced in part to the embedding of the experience of will, and of the notion that will has a force, in the larger conception of causal agency. People appear to be goal-seeking agents who have the special ability to envision their goals consciously in advance of action. The experience of conscious will feels like being a causal agent.

## Darwin Comes to Town
**Author:** Menno Schilthuizen

### Highlights (14)

1. An animation based on the research by Meredith Reba and her colleagues at Yale University shows how cities appear all over the planet, from 5,700 years ago until today—slowly at first, but then, like corn popping in a pan, building up to the deafening crescendo of urbanization during the past century.
   - Location: 342-344
   - Page: 23

2. Evolution employing pre-existing gene variants is what biologists call “soft selection.” But urban evolution could also make use of new mutants that arise there and then (“hard selection”).
   - Location: 1760-1761
   - Page: 115

3. Biologists have a very clear definition of what evolution is, namely the change, over time, of the frequencies of gene variants. The origin of those gene variants is, contrary to what the Darwin’s God blog would like its readers to believe, not evolution. Instead, it is chemistry—errors made in the stitching together of DNA from molecular building blocks in the cell. But the natural selection that causes these chemically originated gene variants to become common or rare, that is the stuff of evolution.
   - Location: 1781-1784
   - Page: 117

4. genes are not everything. For most aspects of our appearance, both nature and nurture come into play. This is true for animals, too. For example, when Tetrix ground hoppers (a kind of drab, camouflaged grasshopper) grow up on light-colored sand, their body color is lighter than when the same animals would grow up on dark sand. This is a form of “plasticity”: with the same DNA, you can get different outcomes. So, it’s easy to imagine that when, in a certain species of animal or plant, you find a color difference between the ones living in the city and the ones living outside, you might mistakenly think this is urban evolution, whereas in fact, there is only plasticity.
   - Location: 1792-1796
   - Page: 117

5. As Kevin Gaston says in an overview article, almost no study in urban evolution has distinguished between genetic adaptation and epigenetic effects. “Addressing these limitations will be a major challenge for urban ecology in the future.” At the moment, most experts think rapid urban evolution is still mostly due to actual changes in the DNA, rather than epigenetics, but few people dare to state this with any great confidence, and the next few years may well prove that epigenetics is a force to be reckoned with. I hope you’ll forgive me this short exposé on epigenetics, plasticity, soft and hard selection, and all the other intricacies surrounding urban evolution.

6. Globally, 5 trillion (yes, that’s a five with twelve zeroes) filter cigarettes are smoked per year, and many of those filters end up in the environment, where they take several years to degrade. No wonder, perhaps, that the Mexican urban birds could not avoid mixing them in with their nest material. Suárez-Rodriguez found up to forty-eight butts per nest. Basically, these birds were brooding in an ashtray. But was it really an accidental inclusion into the birds’ nest material, or was there perhaps something else going on, Suárez-Rodriguez wondered. After all, some birds are known to incorporate green plants in their nests, because the chemical compounds in the leaves keep mites, fleas, and lice at bay. And since cigarettes are made of leaves of the tobacco plant, whose main anti-insect agent is nicotine, perhaps the campus birds benefited indirectly from the human penchant for that same chemical compound. To test this, Suárez-Rodriguez and her colleagues measured the amount of cigarette butts in some sixty nests and also counted the numbers of mites in them. They found a beautiful negative relationship: more butts meant fewer mites, while birds that refused to turn their nests into smokers’ dens paid a dear price for their cleanliness. They had to share their nests with up to a hundred blood-sucking mites, whereas the nests with more than ten grams of cigarette material were virtually free of mites. Unfortunately, we don’t know yet what lies at the root of these bird equivalents of the bug bomb. It could be that the birds are sensing nicotine in the butts and are treating them as if they were the fresh plant leaves they would otherwise have integrated with their nest material. It could also be that, over successive generations, the birds learned that nests with more butts were more comfy. Or, the behavior could have a genetic basis and be a newly evolved defense of bird against bug. If so, the next task for the Mexican researchers would be to see if urban bird-nest mites are evolving a nicotine resistance.

7. A zoologist of Sendai’s Tohoku University, Yoshiaki Nihei, made a detailed study of the behavior. He observed how the crows would wait near a traffic light, wait for it to turn red, then step in front of the cars, place their nuts, and hop back to the curb to wait for the lights to turn. When the traffic had passed, they would return onto the tarmac to retrieve their quarry. His work revealed the crows’ finesse in handling their “tool.”

8. it might be interesting to see if the problem-solving skills of rural bullfinches matched those of the urban ones or not. To study this, he devised two types of puzzle box. Both were made of transparent plastic and contained seeds as a reward, but one (the “drawer” box) could be opened either by tugging on a drawer or by pulling off a lid, while the other type (the “tunnel” box) required both actions: first tugging, then pulling. Audet caught twenty-six urban bullfinches and twenty-seven rural ones and, in the field center, tested if (and, if so, how quickly) they figured out the puzzle boxes. As it turned out, all birds managed to do the drawer box, but the urban birds were twice as quick at it than the rural ones. The more complicated tunnel box was solved by only thirteen of the urban bullfinches—but the rural ones did even worse: only seven of those figured it out, and it took them on average nearly three times as long as the city birds. Clearly, urban bullfinches will be better at coming up with new ways of accessing human-provided food. Whether the urban finches actually carry different genes for problem-solving skills from the rural ones is up for debate. Audet suspects the island might be too small for that and the birds too peripatetic. Then again, if the benefits are great enough, natural selection can still go against the stream, as it were, and slowly build up genetic differences. Problem-solving was key trait number 1. But for an animal to even approach a problem to be solved, it needs to be less than circumspect about new and unfamiliar objects in its environment. Preferably, it needs to be neophilic: keen to approach and investigate anything that is out of the ordinary. In other words, it needs to be curious. Over the years, experimental biologists have had a field day (literally) devising experiments to test urban animals’ neophilia. What is more fun than cobbling together weird and wonderful objects that don’t look like anything and confronting unsuspecting experimental animals with them? It’s like candid camera for biologists. In the name of urban behavioral biology, common mynahs in Australia have been exposed to green hair brushes and yellow rolls of tape, English crows to works of modern art pieced together from chip bags, jam jars, and polystyrene fast-food containers, and chickadees in Tennessee to wonderful towers made from Duplo blocks. And in virtually all cases, urban birds approached these weird objects quicker and with more interest than wary rural birds.

9. the rural visitors were neophobic: they avoided bird feeders with the weird green thing on the roof, whereas in the cities, the reverse took place: here, birds actually flocked to the pimped-up feeding tables. After problem-solving and neophilia, the third and final personality trait that the urban environment will select for is tolerance: a reduced fear of humans. In a 2016 article in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, a team led by Matthew Symonds of Deakin University in Australia compared forty-two different bird species for their so-called FID: flight initiation distance, the average distance a human needs to approach a bird before it takes off. They found that, across all these bird species, the urban version was more tolerant than the one from the countryside. Not only that, but the difference was greater the longer the birds had been residing in cities. For example, jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in cities (which they had already colonized by the 1880s) only get spooked if humans come closer than 8 yards, whereas in rural areas they will take off at 30 yards distance.
   - Location: 2162-2170
   - Page: 141

10. Great spotted woodpeckers (Dendrocopos major), on the other hand, urbanized only since the 1970s, still have similar FIDs in city and countryside: 8 and 12 yards, respectively. That positive relation with the time since first city-dwelling is important, because it shows that tolerance has actually evolved. It is unlikely that over the generations, wariness would wane by each bird generation learning to be a tad less careful around people than their parents were—you would expect this to happen more quickly. Rather, if there is a benefit to being more tolerant, genes for tolerance can gradually accumulate and the species’ personality will evolve. Such an explanation is particularly likely, since the same researchers also found that a bird’s tolerance has nothing to do with the size of their brains: brainy birds did not become tolerant of humans more quickly than, well, bird-brained birds.

11. birds’ struggles to make themselves heard above the din of traffic. Pitch played a crucial role in that. Most urban noise is concentrated in a low-frequency band of up to 3 kilohertz. The repertoire of the great tit spans a range from 2.5 to 7 kilohertz, the lowest notes overlapping with the urban noise. Slabbekoorn and Peet discovered that tits in noisy areas of Leiden deal with this by raising the pitch of their songs to above 3 kilohertz to avoid being drowned out by the sounds of the city, whereas those in quiet neighborhoods also use tones that go down to below 2.5 kilohertz.
   - Location: 2244-2248
   - Page: 147

12. After natural selection (where the environment selects), sexual selection (where the opposite sex does the selecting) is the second great force of evolution. Any genetic property that will make an organism sexier, and thereby gain more or better sexual partners, will see a higher representation in the next generation. As we have learned, such a change in genetic representation is, by definition, evolution. So sexual selection, as well as natural selection, will make a species evolve.
   - Location: 2362-2365
   - Page: 155

13. there is another way in which sexual selection can work. Not by active choosing by the opposite sex, but by battling among sexual rivals; the winner then takes all. Imagine male rhinoceros beetles with horns that are so big that they can topple over all their competitors and always get to mate with any nearby female. These males will pass on their big-horn genes, at the expense of the less-endowed males, and the average horn size of the beetle species will increase over time—at least until horns get so big that they become a liability (and then natural selection kicks in by removing those ridiculously-large-horn genes).

## Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick
**Author:** Maya Dusenbery

### Highlights (9)

1. Ever since, a medical profession that increasingly understands the underlying cause of many diseases—and can objectively confirm patients’ reported symptoms with blood tests and high-tech scans—has tended to attribute to “the mind” any that it can’t see and explain. The terminology has morphed—from hysteria to somatization and conversion disorders to “medically unexplained symptoms”—but the idea has remained remarkably unchanged.
   - Location: 210-213

2. Furthermore, it’s not only financial barriers that affect women’s access to the medical system. A quarter of women, regardless of income, reported that a reason they went without health care was that they simply didn’t have time to go to the doctor. For low-income women especially, not being able to take time off from work, a lack of transportation, and problems finding childcare are also common barriers. Women make up a majority of workers in low-wage and part-time jobs that often don’t provide sick days. Until we have federally mandated sick days, medical leave, and affordable childcare for all, too many women will remain unable to get the medical care they need. It doesn’t matter whether you have insurance and can afford your co-pays, if you don’t have the kind of job flexibility that allows you to go to an appointment, let alone two or three. A lack of access to the medical system, of course, can often supersede any of the problems women patients face within it. If you can’t afford to see a doctor at all, whether that doctor would take your symptoms seriously is a moot point. And all the biomedical knowledge in the world is meaningless if the people who need it most can’t benefit from

4. The United States is the only country in the developed world where the maternal mortality rate is on the rise, more than doubling in the last twenty-five years.

5. When it comes to “active” life expectancy—the number of years living free from significant limitations that prevent you from doing everyday tasks—men have overtaken women over the past three decades. Women still live longer, but men live better longer. This difference—women’s lower mortality but higher morbidity—has been known as the “gender paradox.”

7. With no incentive to enroll them and widespread fears of liability for harm to the fetus, the research community has left pregnant patients to be “therapeutic orphans,” all but entirely left out of biomedical studies. In a 2013 analysis, 95 percent of industry-sponsored clinical drug trials excluded pregnant people, and only 1 percent were designed specifically to study them. Only eight medications are currently approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy. And all of them are used for conditions related to the pregnancy itself, like alleviating nausea or inducing labor; any drug used to treat other diseases during pregnancy is prescribed “off-label”—without the prior testing needed for FDA sign-off.

8. Sex/gender differences have been observed in the prevalence, severity, symptoms, and risk factors of countless diseases. To take just a few examples: Women are two to ten times more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. Women are more likely than men to recover language ability after suffering a left-hemisphere stroke. Women who have lung cancer are more likely than their male counterparts to have never smoked. Women more commonly do not have any chest pain when experiencing a heart attack. Differences have been found in the responses to many drugs, both in the pharmacokinetics (which is how the body acts on the drug) and the pharmacodynamics (which is how the drug acts on the body). Women have a greater risk than men of developing a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia that can be triggered by a variety of drugs, including antibiotics, antidepressants, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Beta-blockers tend to have a more pronounced effect in women than in men. Women with depression generally respond better to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) than tricyclic antidepressants, while the opposite is true of men. Women tend to wake up from general anesthesia faster than men and suffer more side effects from it. These sex/gender differences in drug response, it should be noted, are not all simply due to women’s lower average body weight. Although that is one obvious difference, there’s a complicated mix of other factors that affect pharmacokinetics, including percentage of body fat, hormonal fluctuations, enzyme levels, and speed of metabolism. One article on sex/gender differences in drug response notes that these are “often attributed solely to body weight differences and may therefore be dismissed as not being clinically significant, once corrected for these body weight differences.” Except, they point out, it is not even standard practice to correct for body weight: “Paradoxically however, most drugs are not administered on a mg/kg basis but as a ‘one size fits all’ dose, leading to higher exposures in women due to their generally lower body weight.”

9. experience quite literally shapes our biology—even our seemingly solid and immutable skeleton—muddling attempts at divvying up the role of sex versus gender, biology versus culture, nature versus nurture. That’s why in this book I generally use the term sex/gender difference when discussing these average differences between men and women.

## The Wizard and the Prophet
**Author:** Charles C. Mann

### Highlights (17)

1. The two people were William Vogt and Norman Borlaug. Vogt, born in 1902, laid out the basic ideas for the modern environmental movement. In particular, he founded what the Hampshire College demographer Betsy Hartmann has called “apocalyptic environmentalism”—the belief that unless humankind drastically reduces consumption its growing numbers and appetite will overwhelm the planet’s ecosystems. In best-selling books and powerful speeches, Vogt argued that affluence is not our greatest achievement but our biggest problem. Our prosperity is temporary, he said, because it is based on taking more from Earth than it can give. If we continue, the unavoidable result will be devastation on a global scale, perhaps including our extinction. Cut back! Cut back! was his mantra. Otherwise everyone will lose! Borlaug, born twelve years later, has become the emblem of what has been termed “techno-optimism” or “cornucopianism”—the view that science and technology, properly applied, can help us produce our way out of our predicament. Exemplifying this idea, Borlaug was the primary figure in the research that in the 1960s created the “Green Revolution,” the combination of high-yielding crop varieties and agronomic techniques that raised grain harvests around the world, helping to avert tens of millions of deaths from hunger. To Borlaug, affluence was not the problem but the solution. Only by getting richer, smarter, and more knowledgeable can humankind create the science that will resolve our environmental dilemmas. Innovate! Innovate! was Borlaug’s cry. Only in that way can everyone win!

2. The most common louse to afflict humans, he learned, is an arthropod, Pediculus humanus, which lives on human bodies, as its name suggests. P. humanus has two distinct subspecies: P. humanus capitis, head lice, which feed and live on the scalp; and P. humanus corporis, body lice, which feed on skin but live in clothing. In fact, body lice are so dependent on the protection of clothing that they cannot survive more than a few hours away from it. It occurred to Stoneking that the difference between the two subspecies could be used as an evolutionary probe. P. humanus capitis, the head louse, could be an ancient annoyance, because human beings have always had hair for it to infest. But P. humanus corporis, the body louse, must not be especially old, because its dependence on clothing meant that it could not have existed when humans went naked. Humanity’s great cover-up had created a new ecological niche, and some head lice had rushed to fill it. Natural selection thereupon did its magic; a new subspecies arose. While Stoneking couldn’t be sure that this scenario had taken place, it seemed likely. If his idea was correct, then discovering when the body louse diverged from the head louse would provide a rough date for when people first wore clothing.

3. the body louse seemed to have separated from the head louse about 107,000 years ago. This meant, Stoneking hypothesized, that clothing also dated from about 107,000 years ago.

4. It was not only clothing. As scientists have painstakingly established, a host of innovations were occurring around that time. Human beings were engraving pieces of ochre and ostrich shells in southern Africa. They were carving elegant harpoons from bone in central Africa. They were making ornamental beads in northwestern Africa. They were burying the dead with care in the Levant, just across from northeast Africa. They were, in sum, becoming human.

5. Our species first clearly appears in the archaeological record about 300,000 years ago (though we may well have emerged before then). Until about 75,000 years ago—that is, for the majority of our existence on Earth—humankind was restricted to Africa, though we sent out occasional forays into the rest of the world, almost all unsuccessful, all limited in scope. Around 70,000 years ago, everything changed. People raced across the continents like so many imported fire ants. Human footprints appeared in Australia within as few as ten thousand years, perhaps within four or five thousand. Stay-at-home Homo sapiens 1.0, a wallflower that would never have interested Lynn Margulis, had been replaced by aggressively expansive Homo sapiens 2.0. Something happened, for better and worse, and we were born. No more than a few hundred people initially left Africa, if geneticists are correct. And for a long time their geographic expansion was not matched by an increase in population. As recently as ten thousand years ago we numbered perhaps 5 million, about one human being for every five square miles of Earth’s habitable surface. Homo sapiens was a scarcely noticeable dusting on the surface of a planet dominated by microbes. At about this time—10,000 years ago, give or take a millennium—our species swung around the first inflection point, with the invention of agriculture.

6. *2   The two types of bacteria are bacteria proper and archaea, which resemble bacteria but don’t have a cell nucleus. “Protist” is a catch-all category for everything else—anything living that is not an animal, plant, fungus, or bacterium. Examples include amoebas, slime molds, and single-celled algae. Viruses are not usually included in these lists, because they are so simple that most biologists don’t view them as a form of life.

8. Weaver was a busy man.

9. Because that world will be (almost certainly) more numerous and (probably) more affluent, it is commonly stated that harvests will have to double by 2050. Some researchers believe this figure is overstated—a 50 percent increase would do the trick. In either case, though, how can it be done? Wizards see an essential part of the answer in a new technology: genetic engineering. Hacking photosynthesis exemplifies its potential—reaching into the heart of life to ensure a better existence for millions of our fellows. By contrast, Prophets view reworking photosynthesis as embodying an ecologically foolish mania for growth and accumulation that will lead to destruction. At bottom, in their view, genetic engineering has the same fundamental fault as Weaver’s memo: imagining that the world in all its complexity can be boiled down to a small number of physical parts that can be freely measured and manipulated. “Reductionism” is the term of art for this idea, and agriculture is but one focus of a broader disagreement over its place.

10. In ancient times, life was typically viewed as a principle or essence: qi in China, ase in Nigeria, mana in Polynesia, manitou in the Algonkian cultures of North America, pneuma to the Greeks, the Force in a galaxy far, far away. Living creatures and non-living things are both made of matter, long-ago thinkers said. But the former eat, reproduce, act with intent, and do a hundred other things that seem beyond the capacities of the non-living. It was easy for the ancients to explain the gulf between life and non-life by imagining that a special kind of immaterial energy flows through and sustains living tissues. Without this essence, a live body would be a mere mechanism, not an organism.

11. Plants need nitrogen chiefly to make a substance called rubisco, a prima donna in the dance of interactions
   - Location: 3142-3143
   - Page: 205

12. rubisco molecules take carbon dioxide from the air, insert it into the maelstrom of photosynthesis, then go back for more. The name “rubisco” was coined, jokingly, in 1979, to sound like a breakfast cereal; it is a sorta-kinda acronym for the compound’s scientific name, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Rubisco’s catalytic actions are the limiting step in photosynthesis, which means the rate at which rubisco functions determines the rate of the entire process. Photosynthesis walks at the speed of rubisco. Alas, rubisco is, by biological standards, a sluggard, a lazybones, a couch potato. It causes reactions to occur, but very slowly. Whereas typical enzymes catalyze thousands of reactions a second, rubisco deigns to involve itself with just two or three per second.
   - Location: 3148-3154
   - Page: 206

13. as much as two out of every five times, rubisco fails to pick up carbon dioxide, fumblingly grabs oxygen instead, and tries to shove the oxygen into a chemical reaction that can’t use it. To get rid of the unneeded oxygen, plants have evolved an entire secondary process that pumps it out of the cell and re-primes the rubisco to try again for carbon dioxide. The mistakes waste energy. Rubisco’s penchant for oxygen reduces the maximum efficiency of photosynthesis by almost half. Because rubisco gets worse at distinguishing between oxygen and carbon dioxide as temperatures rise, the problem is worse in the tropics than in cooler zones. But even in cool climates, wheat harvests would rise by a fifth and soybean harvests by a third if rubisco could distinguish oxygen from carbon dioxide. To overcome rubisco’s lassitude and maladroitness, plants make a lot of it. As much as half of the protein in many plant leaves, by weight, is rubisco—it is often said to be the world’s most abundant protein. One estimate is that plants and microorganisms contain more than eleven pounds of rubisco for every person on Earth. The biological chain seems clear: more nitrogen ⇒ more rubisco ⇒ more photosynthesis ⇒ more plant growth ⇒ more food from farms.

14. By our actions today (burning fossil fuels), the argument is, we are dumping problems (drought, sea-level rise) on tomorrow. On the one hand, forcing other people to clean up our mess violates basic notions of fairness. On the other hand, actually preventing climate-change problems would require societies today to make investments, some of them costly, to benefit people in the faraway future. It’s like asking teenagers to save for their grandchildren’s retirement. Or, maybe, for somebody else’s grandchildren. Not many would do it.
   - Location: 5444-5448

15. The basis for arguing for action on climate change is the belief that we have a moral responsibility to people in the future. But this is asking one group of people to make wrenching changes to help a completely different set of people to whom they have no tangible connection. Indeed, this other set of people doesn’t exist. When one tries to make plans for nonexistent people, the result is an intellectual quagmire, because there is no way to know what those hypothetical future people will want.

16. Evolution has provided the human brain with marvelous tools for detecting and resolving fast-moving, clearly visible, small-scale, near-future risks. By the same token, the brain is easily overwhelmed by slow, abstract, large, long-term problems. Patiently dribbling money, year by year, into a retirement account, calculating the insurance needed to compensate for an unlikely but real hazard, contemplating the arrangement of one’s death—they boggle the mind. (Most people’s minds, anyway.) Climate change is all of these and more: gradual, impalpable, world-altering, multigenerational, a situation that will not become readily tangible until irreversible lines already have been crossed. “It is not the sort of problem that Mother Nature raised us to solve or even notice,” Jamieson, the philosopher, has written.

## The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy
**Author:** Michael Lewis

### Highlights (6)

1. “The Office of Science in DOE is not the Office of Science for DOE,” said MacWilliams. “It’s the Office of Science for all science in America. I realized pretty quickly that it was the place where you could work on the two biggest risks to human existence, nuclear weapons and climate change.”

2. “With a very complex mission and 115,000 people spread out across the country, shit happens every day,” said MacWilliams. Take the project to carve football-field-length caverns inside New Mexico salt beds to store radioactive waste, at the WIPP (Waste Isolation Pilot Plant) facility. The waste would go into barrels and the barrels would go into the caverns, where the salt would eventually entomb them. The contents of the barrels were volatile and so needed to be seasoned with, believe it or not, kitty litter. In 2014, according to a former DOE official, a federal contractor in Los Alamos, having been told to pack the barrels with “inorganic kitty litter,” had scribbled down “an organic kitty litter.” The barrel with organic kitty litter in it had burst and spread waste inside the cavern. The site was closed for three years, significantly backing up nuclear waste disposal in the United States and costing $500 million to clean, while the contractor claimed the company was merely following procedures given to it by Los Alamos.

3. The list of things that might go wrong inside the DOE was endless. The driver of a heavily armed unit assigned to move plutonium around the country was pulled over, on the job, for drunk driving. An eighty-two-year-old nun cut through the perimeter fence of a facility in Tennessee that housed weapons-grade nuclear material. A medical facility ordered a speck of plutonium for research, and a weapons-lab clerk misplaced a decimal point and FedExed the researchers a chunk of the stuff so big it should have been under armed guard—whereupon horrified medical researchers tried to FedEx it back. “At DOE even the regular scheduled meetings started with” You’re not going to believe this,’” says former chief of staff Kevin Knobloch.

4. the DOE has the job of ensuring that nuclear weapons are not lost or stolen, or at the slightest risk of exploding when they should not. “It’s a thing Rick Perry should worry about every day,” he says. “Are you telling me that there have been scares?” He thinks a moment. “They’ve never had a weapon that has been lost,” he says carefully. “Weapons have fallen off planes.” He pauses again. “I would encourage you to spend an hour reading about Broken Arrows.” “Broken Arrow” is a military term of art for a nuclear accident that doesn’t lead to a nuclear war. MacWilliams has had to learn all about these. Now he tells me about an incident that occurred back in 1961, and was largely declassified in 2013, just as he began his stint at DOE. A pair of 4-megaton hydrogen bombs, each more than 250 times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, broke off a damaged B-52 over North Carolina. One of the bombs disintegrated upon impact, but the other floated down beneath its parachute and armed itself. It was later found in a field outside Goldsboro, North Carolina, with three of its four safety mechanisms tripped or rendered ineffective by the plane’s breakup. Had the fourth switch flipped, a vast section of eastern North Carolina would have been destroyed, and nuclear fallout might have descended on Washington, DC, and New York City. “The reason it’s worth thinking about this,” says MacWilliams, “is the reason that bomb didn’t go off was because of all the safety devices on the bombs, designed by what is now DOE.”

5. In December 1938, German scientists discovered uranium fission. Physicist Enrico Fermi’s report on the Germans’ work made its way to Albert Einstein, and in 1939 Einstein wrote a letter to Franklin Roosevelt. That letter is the founding document of the Department of Energy. By the early 1940s the United States government understood that for democracy to survive it needed to beat Hitler to the atom bomb.

2. In 1970, robotics professor Masahiro Mori came up with the concept of the ‘uncanny valley’ (originally Bukimi no Tani Genshō). His hypothesis was that we humans empathise with machines that have human attributes, up until the point where they approach indistinguishability from reality. At that point, the ‘almost-human’ robot becomes unsettling and uncanny, and fills us with revulsion. The origins of the term itself go back to early twentieth-century psychoanalysis. In 1906, Ernst Jentsch’s essay On the Psychology of the Uncanny mentioned a particular instance of an unsettling feeling: ‘one of the most reliable artistic devices for producing uncanny effects easily is to leave the reader in uncertainty as to whether he has a human person or rather an automaton before him’. Freud expanded on Jentsch’s work in his 1919 essay The Uncanny, a discussion around the German word unheimlich, connoting the unfamiliar and the unknown.

3. There are a number of theories as to why we experience this feeling of the uncanny valley. A significant factor may be that ‘human-looking but not alive’ is redolent of death. Mori gave the example of viewing a corpse: it’s not a pleasant experience and could be frightening, and if it were to move then we would be terrified.

But he began to ponder how a machine might be able to think for itself, to compute chess moves. From working on his engines, he concluded that such games of intellect could be automated, and he began to devise strategies for doing so.

9. The Church’s control over sexuality had a useful, more tangible value than a parishioner’s soul: money. The business of reproduction was messing up land ownership, and was one of the fundamental reasons why a vow of celibacy was introduced for priests. The laws of primogeniture – where the first son inherits the family’s worldly goods – was seen as a threat to the Church’s property portfolio. If priests passed on their possessions to their offspring, then that was a loss to the institution. The easiest solution? No sons for clerics!

10. Prior to ad 306 (the date of the Council of Elvira in Spain), priests were allowed to marry, though they were expected to be monogamous – a change brought about by the somewhat uptight Saint Paul. Following the Council of Elvira, a new narrative was written where sex was sinful, and subsequent popes made sure that men of the cloth toed the line.

11. ‘The idea of sex as a fundamental component of sociality, and sociality as a fundamental component of cognition, is a much more recent notion,’ Bishop tells me. ‘This approach defines an alternative conception of cognition – what’s known as an enactive approach. In contrast to classical cognitive science, enactivism has a strongly biological and embodied focus, attempting to understand experience and behaviour in the light of interactions of organisms and their worlds. Viewed in terms of sociality, sexual activity and sexuality emerge as fundamental drivers of an organism’s cognitive process and sense-making activities. In this manner we can explore sex and sociality as fundamental components of cognition itself.’

12. In 2007, Dr David Levy, a computer scientist and world-leading chess player, published in book form the work that made up his PhD thesis. Its title? Love and Sex with Robots.

13. John Danaher and Neil McArthur brought together a collection of experts to create an edited collection called Robot Sex. The book, subsequently published in 2017, is an excellent, clear and thorough debate on the social and ethical implications of sex with robots. Danaher is an academic in law, McArthur in philosophy, and together they have produced a collection of essays that tackles the subject from both of these directions and more. It draws on contributions from psychology, law, economics, religious studies and philosophy (lots of philosophy) to examine the issues and debate whether or not it’s a good thing, from both the human and the robot’s perspective.

14. Michael Kühler, a philosopher from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. Kühler’s talk was just as fascinating: what is romantic love? – from a philosophical perspective. In my detailed readings of neurobiology papers and psychology text books, I had neglected the philosophical theories, of which, according to Kühler, there are three. The first theory, explained Kühler, is ‘love as union’. This goes back to Aristophanes’ fantastical myths, as written by Plato: the idea that we humans have a literal other half, from whom we were cruelly separated by Zeus. We spend our time searching for this missing part of us and when we find it, we never want to be separated from it. This is the idea of love as union: two single people becoming a couple, ‘I’ becoming ‘we’, a redefinition of our personal identity. The second theory is that of love as an interpersonal relationship: each lover keeps their identity but it is affected by being part of a couple, sharing emotional states and joint activities with each other. The third theory, Kühler said, is love as a subjective stance. Here there is a beloved, who is the object of desire, and the other who cares for them altruistically. In this setting, the object doesn’t have to be a person, although, remarked Kühler, for the object to flourish it would probably require personhood. But does AI count as a person? Legally, no. Or not yet. But there are some typical conditions of personhood that an AI can share: thinking and communication, for example. Of course, an AI falls short in some of the other conditions, such as self-awareness, a capacity for care and true autonomy.

16. You’ve probably played Exquisite Corpses before. I had, but I never knew the proper name for the game. It turns out that it was very popular among the Surrealists, who played it at parties. The premise is simple: take a sheet of paper, make sure no one is watching, and draw a head in the top quarter. Fold the paper over so the head cannot be seen, and pass it to the next person so that they can draw the body. Once they are done, they fold the paper again and pass it on for the next person to draw the legs. A final fold, and the feet are added. The sheet of paper is then unfolded with great ceremony and the exquisite corpse is revealed.

17. The word ‘skeuomorphism’ describes how an object mimics its real-world counterpart – much like a sex robot mimicking the human form. It’s commonly employed in software development and product development because it gives the user an expectation of how to interact with something. The ‘trashcan’ on a computer used to dispose of files is one example: by showing a picture of a rubbish bin, the user knows that anything put into it will be discarded.
   - Location: 3443-3446

18. From what I can see, sex toys have moved into a design-led phase where functionality has been refined and their form is now much more important. By contrast, sex robots are still very much in an engineering-led phase where functionality is key. These current sex robots are artificial products that still adhere to expected physical conventions. They have not yet moved into the design-led phase. New forms have not been explored. A transition from engineering to design is common. Software is one such example, especially in terms of user interfaces. Icons, for example, began as quite detailed attempts at realistic depiction of real-world items before moving to the flat style seen today. While recognisable traits can be useful, indicating how we should use or engage with an object, we can definitely get away with merely indicating them rather than making them explicit (if you’ll pardon the pun). To me, the interesting future is the one where the two separate paths of sex toys and sex dolls converge. Move away from the idea of the pornified fembot and we also move away from the perpetuation of objectification. A step into abstraction is a step away from sexual objectification and entrenched gender roles. Extending smart sex toy development into more embodied forms bridges the gap: if you want to design a sex robot, why not pick the features that could bring the greatest pleasure? A velvet or silk body, sensors and mixed genitalia; tentacles instead of arms? While current prototype sex robots hinge on visual appearance and voice, a multisensory approach – or even a non-visual approach – is also perfectly possible.

2. Writing in the same years as Isabel, the German social theorist Theodor Adorno, who had fled to the United States upon the Nazis’ assumption of power, would make the connection between type and fascist ideology explicit in The Authoritarian Personality (1950). Perhaps the most famous sociological study of the midcentury, The Authoritarian Personality offered a blistering critique of the typological work Hay and Isabel did and its relationship to Hitler’s ethnocentric fascism. “The critique of psychological types expresses a truly humane impulse,” Adorno wrote. It was “directed against that kind of subsumption of individuals against pre-established classes which has been consummated in Nazi Germany, where the labeling of live human beings, independent of their specific qualities, resulted in decisions about their life and death. The desire to construct types was itself indicative of the potentially fascist character,” Adorno argued. No matter what system of type one used—the Humm-Wadsworth Temperament Scale, the Bernreuter Personality Inventory, various schema of ethnic or racial or national categorization—the impulse to categorize people gestured to a basic rigidity of thought, an anti-humanist, anti-enlightenment propensity for flattening individuals into predetermined classes so that they could be managed and manipulated with greater ease. For Adorno, type and its people-sorting instruments had not created this state of affairs. They were merely a symptom of a more invasive psychological disease: social modernity. The rise of industrial capitalism and the division of people into classes—owners versus workers, white collar versus blue collar—had left an indelible imprint on the souls of men and women, stamping certain predictable ways of thinking and feeling onto their psyches. Those who believed in the sanctity of the individual had been conditioned to do so by their class positions. If one worked a managerial job, the kind of job that stressed creativity and gumption and thinking “outside the box,” one would be more inclined to consider oneself a freethinking, free-acting human being. A factory worker, a mechanic, or a deliveryman had not been initiated into this language of self-actualization because he had no profitable use for it. “There is reason to look for psychological types because the world in which we live is typed and ‘produces’ different ‘types’ of persons,” Adorno wrote. “The critique of typology should not neglect the fact that large numbers of people are no longer, or rather never were, ‘individuals’ in the sense of traditional nineteenth-century philosophy.” Most people did not enjoy real freedom of action or true individuation. The concept of the individual was an “ideological veil,” Adorno insisted—a romantic capitalist fiction in a society committed to categorizing and dividing people while pretending to safeguard their souls. Yet Adorno was eager to acknowledge that not all typologies served as devices for dividing the world into “sheep and buck.” Some of them had “hit upon something,” he speculated—a hazy kind of truth about the self. Not all forms of assessment proceeded by pathologizing personality, by dividing human beings into those who were “normal” and those who were not, as the Humm-Wadsworth did. Some typological systems offered individuals more than just passive membership in a predetermined psychological class. They armed the populace with a clarifying language of self-awareness, a language capable of fighting widespread political and social manipulation where it began—in the minds of the people. Within such ideal typological systems, the very idea of having a self emerged as a weapon of mass resistance, undoing the impulse to type—and thus to control—from within. Adorno was hard at work designing a questionnaire that identified prefascistic tendencies, and he believed that his test, which he would later call the “F scale,” was the premier example of such a typological system.

3. As the war came to its end, Adorno joined forces with Berkeley psychologists R. Nevitt Sanford, Else Frenkel-Brunswik, and Daniel Levinson in a joint mission, funded by the American Jewish Committee, to investigate the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of fascism. The book that resulted, The Authoritarian Personality, offered its readers a sketch of the “potentially fascistic individual”: a person whose psychological makeup made him susceptible to antidemocratic propaganda, even if he never engaged in any violent behavior. In contrast to a personologist like Murray, Adorno and his team were interested not in the singularity of Hitler but in the audience members who had been seduced by Nazi ideology—those prone to the same prejudice, hostility, and irrationality to which Hitler gave voice. “The task of fascist propaganda…,” the authors wrote, “is rendered easier to the degree that antidemocratic potentials already exist in the great mass of people.” The Nazis were effective insofar as they were able to “activate every ounce” of the German people’s antidemocratic potential while stamping out the “slightest spark of rebellion.”

4. It was not enough to expose one fascistic leader as a babbling madman to prevent the rise of fascism elsewhere, when fascism was an extension of industrial modernity. The hierarchical division of society into classes meant that the marks of social repression were impressed onto the soul long before a demagogic leader ever opened his mouth to speak.

5. Adorno and his team began by drafting what they called the “F scale,” a questionnaire that asked its respondents to indicate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with each of its forty-four items. Each item proceeded from Adorno’s belief that fascistic leaders preyed on men who lacked critical acuity, men who were conventional, obsequious, respectful of middle-class values, eager to glorify and submit to authority.

2. For more than 150,000 years, these humans behaved pretty much the same as any other protohuman species. And then, around the year 50,000 BCE, something happened: these anatomically modern humans suddenly started acting like us. They began to fish, create art, bury their dead, and decorate their bodies. They began to think abstractly. Most important, they began to talk. The technology of language—and it is a technology, it’s something we’ve had to invent, and it took us over 100,000 years to do it—is the greatest gift we humans have ever given ourselves.

The reason is not that it will create a black hole but rather because it exposes a contradiction at the heart of our mathematical system. Consider taking a number (let’s use 1) and dividing it by progressively smaller numbers that approach, but never quite reach, zero. Zero marks the point where negative numbers end and positive numbers begin. If we approach it from the positive side, we’ll see that 1 divided by 1 is 1, 1 divided by 0.1 is 10, and 1 divided by 0.001 is 1,000. The smaller the number you divide by gets, the larger the result gets. Therefore, one divided by zero should equal infinity. But there’s a problem if we approach zero from the opposite end, dividing by progressively smaller negative numbers, again getting closer and closer to zero. Here we see that 1 divided by –1 equals –1, 1 divided by –0.1 is –10, and 1 divided by –0.001 is –1,000. So here the smaller the number you divide by, the closer it gets to negative infinity. So by this logic, 1/0 should equal negative infinity. But a number can’t be equal to infinity and negative infinity at the same time. That is, in fact, just about as unequal as two numbers can possibly get. So we’ve got a contradiction. And it’s this contradiction that makes us say, “You can’t divide by zero, because the answer doesn’t make sense, and nobody knows how to fix that yet.”

## Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future

### Highlights (5)

1. Fallout of radioactive iodine from atmospheric detonations of nuclear bombs in Nevada dwarfed Chernobyl emissions three times over.

2. The total emissions from nuclear tests were a thousand times greater than emissions from Chernobyl. The Soviets, British, French, Chinese, Indians, and Pakistanis also made nuclear bombs, a messy process, and blew them up, exposing people to radioactive emissions from 520 atmospheric and 1,500 underground detonations of nuclear bombs (underground tests also vent radioactivity into the atmosphere). From 1945 to 1998, military leaders blew up bombs in deserts, in polar regions, on tropical islands, underground, under water, and at high altitudes. They exploded nuclear bombs on towers and barges and suspended them from balloons. Nuclear weapons tests make up the primary man-made contribution of radioactive exposures to the world’s population. Globally, atmospheric tests released at least 20 billion curies of radioactive iodine alone.40 Chernobyl issued far less at 45 million curies of iodine-131.41 Three-quarters of fallout from nuclear testing landed in the Northern Hemisphere.

3. I elaborate on the inner workings of these UN agencies to spotlight the arsenal of tactics scientific administrators deployed to make the reports of a wide range of health problems in the Chernobyl territories go away. They drew from a well-known toolbox of tactics familiar from controversies surrounding lead, tobacco, and chemical toxins.54 The playbook was rich and varied: classify data, limit questions, stonewall investigations, block funding for research, sponsor rival studies, relate dangers to “natural” risks, draw up study protocols designed to find nothing but catastrophic effects, extrapolate and estimate to produce numbers that hide uncertainties and guesswork, privately slander and threaten dissenting scientists, and cast doubt on known facts so that scientists must pursue expensive and duplicative investigations to prove what is clearly evident.

4. NOW IT IS clear that most of the “foreign experts,” global leaders in radiation medicine, were wrong. In 1996, WHO, UNSCEAR, and IAEA conceded that, seven years after Ukrainian and Belarusian officials announced the problem, the still skyrocketing increases in thyroid cancer in children were due to Chernobyl exposures. Mettler, Wachholz, and other scientists conceded that their models failed them: “There is a major discrepancy,” they wrote, “between estimates of thyroid cancer predicted using dosimetry together with standard risk-projection models and the magnitude of the increase that has actually been seen.”59

1. Soviets launched Sputnik 2 just thirty-two days after its predecessor.

2. Meanwhile, since the successful Jupiter-C launch of Explorer, von Braun had become even more of a national hero, and he had capitalized on his fame. In its cover story about him, Time magazine dubbed von Braun “the Seer of Space,” and he was well paid for his articles and speeches. The Disney movie about his life was produced and titled I Aim at the Stars. The film was neither dramatically effective nor factually accurate—the former SS major was depicted as being persecuted by the Nazis, and his Peenemünde secretary became an Allied spy, two of many perversions of the truth. The film’s most lasting legacy came from comedian Mort Sahl, who suggested that it should have been subtitled But Sometimes I Hit London.

6. The test-pilot mortality rate at the time was horrendously high; in 1952, at the air force’s test-pilot school at Edwards Air Force Base, sixty-two pilots had died in just thirty-six weeks. Overall, about one in four test pilots perished. Eight men had been killed getting just one fighter jet, the F-104, operational. Test pilots were on close terms with death, and they were even blasé about it. A few of the Seven had told their examiners that they were onboard with the program as long as there was a good chance of survival—by which they meant at least 50 percent.

## Ten Drugs

1. in the old days lived long enough to get them. Thanks to drugs, a group of scientists recently wrote, “People have different diseases, doctors hold different ideas about those diseases, and diseases carry different meanings in society.”

2. vaccines and antibiotics moved us from being helpless victims of epidemics to being able to fight them off. Combined with more effective public health measures—cleaner drinking water, better sewage systems, better hospitals—drugs moved us from fearing the diseases of childhood to suffering the diseases of the old. That’s a tribute to medicine in general, and to drugs in particular.

3. Pushed by huge ad campaigns and often buttressed by glowing media reports, newly released blockbuster drugs enter what’s called the Seige cycle (named after Max Seige, a German researcher who first described it early in the last century). It happens time and time again: An astounding new drug is released to intense enthusiasm and wide adoption (that’s stage 1 of the Seige cycle). This honeymoon period is followed within a few years by increasing numbers of negative news articles about the hot-selling new drug’s dangers (stage 2). Suddenly everyone is alarmed that yesterday’s wonder drug is today’s looming threat. Then that, too, passes, and we get to stage 3, a more balanced attitude with a more sober understanding of what the drug can really do, as it settles into moderate sales and its proper place in the pantheon of drugs. Then, ta-da!, a drugmaker releases its next miracle drug, and the cycle starts all over. When you hear the next breathless news report about the next breakthrough drug, remember the Seige cycle.

4. The answer came in 1841 when a French surgeon named Charles Gabriel Pravaz introduced a new tool to medicine. Pravaz was looking for a way to treat varicose veins and thought that using drugs to slow blood clotting might help. The trouble was that the drugs he wanted to use, when taken by mouth, were destroyed in the stomach. He needed a way to deliver them directly into veins. So he asked a local metalworker to craft a hollow needle out of platinum, and to the needle he attached a small silver plunger. The idea was to load the plunger with the drug, insert the needle into the vein, then push in the drug. He had made the first syringe.

5. That doesn’t mean that anti-vaccination activism has gone away. If anything, it’s stronger than it’s been in the past century, fueled by rumors and scares exploding across the Internet. In part, today’s anti-vaccination movement is rooted in vaccination’s success. The diseases we vaccinate against now seem like harmless ghosts for the most part, robbed of their power to terrify—because vaccines have made them a thing of the past. Few people living today have ever seen a case of smallpox, or diphtheria, or polio. They’ve never lost a brother like Lady Mary did, or a daughter like Janet Parker’s mother, to these killers. Our sense of risk is lessened to the point where, to many, the benefits of vaccination seem small—so small that even vague risks from vaccines seem large. That

6. During the two decades after World War II, the death rate from childhood diseases dropped by more than 90 percent, and the average life expectancy in the United States increased by more than ten years.

7. Enter Giles Brindley, polymath, logical bassoonist, and one of the last practitioners of the ancient and honorable tradition of medical self-experimentation. From Paracelsus and his laudanum to Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who discovered LSD, doctors throughout history had often tried experimental drugs on themselves before involving innocent patients. Brindley, in his fifties at the time, had been self-experimenting with his penis. Specifically, he had been injecting it with drugs in a search for something that would chemically, rather than mechanically, create an erection. And, he told his Las Vegas audience, he had been making progress. He showed thirty or so slides of the effects. Even at a urology gathering it seemed a bit adventurous (at least in the days before social media) to see a man so routinely sharing shots of his own member. But the audience took it in stride. Until Brindley felt compelled to demonstrate his results. At the end of his slide set, he told the audience that just before coming down to the conference hall he had injected himself in his hotel room. He stepped around the podium and, to general dismay, pulled his running pants up tight to show the results. “At this point,” remembered one audience member, “I, and I believe everyone else in the room, was agog . . . I could scarcely believe what was happening on stage.” The good professor then looked down, shook his head, and said, “Unfortunately, this doesn’t display the results clearly enough.” And he dropped his pants. There was not a sound in the room. “Everyone had stopped breathing,” an attendee remembered. Brindley paused dramatically, then said, “I’d like to give some of the audience the opportunity to confirm the degree of tumescence.” Pants around his knees, he shuffled off the stage and toward the audience. Some of the women in the front row threw up their arms and screamed. Their cries seemed to awaken Brindley. Realizing the effect he was having, he hurriedly pulled up his pants, returned to the podium, and finished his lecture.

## Music Instinct
**Author:** Ball, Philip;

### Highlights (13)

1. We know of societies without writing, and even without visual art – but none, it seems, lack some form of music.
   - Location: 116-116
   - Page: 8

2. The science of music cognition is starting to make the question of universals respectable again. Perhaps this is because it has tended to break down music into the simplest structural elements, such as pitch and tone and rhythm, the perception and organization of which would seem to be an essential part of any listener’s ability to transform sound into music regardless of the function that it serves. This approach can only get so far, however, because even the issue of what we perceive is not simply a matter of auditory acoustics: just as emotional, social and cultural factors may promote selective hearing of language, so they impinge on music. A Western listener can hear just about any music on the radio and make some kind of assessment of it without knowing anything about the composer, performer, period or context of the music. This would be an alien notion to some preliterate societies such as the Basongye or the Flathead Native Americans, for whom a response to, and even a recognition of, music depends on context, on the reason why it is being played and

3. heard. To ask, as music psychologists routinely do of their test subjects, how one feels about particular intervals or rhythms has no meaning for these people – those are not, to them, questions about music at all.

4. African apes also use their voices more for affective than for informative reasons, unlike the coded calls of many other animals. This has led some researchers to speculate about whether music stemmed from emotive rather than semantic signalling.
   - Location: 468-470
   - Page: 31

5. Music and language have just too many important similarities for these to be chance occurrences alone,’ claims Brown. He believes that a musilanguage could have served as a launching stage for both music and language if it contained three essential features: lexical tone (the use of pitch to convey semantic meaning), combinatorial formation of small phrases, and expressive phrasing principles, which add emphasis and connote emotion (for example, fast tempos to convey happiness, and slow to convey sadness). A remnant of such musilanguage might be perceived in the so-called Auchmartin and Enermartin of some Ecuadorian tribes, which are forms of song-speech used respectively by strangers meeting on a jungle path and by groups of men to promote courage before battle.
   - Location: 484-490
   - Page: 32

6. perhaps relics of musilanguage survive in tonal languages, and in the way songs and rhythmic poems are often used in preliterate cultures to encode important knowledge. Here the musicality aids memory: it’s generally much easier to memorize poetry than text, and we typically find song lyrics easier to recall when we sing rather than say them.

7. some to suspect that we shouldn’t be searching for music’s origins in the benefits it might confer on individuals, but rather, in how it is advantageous to an entire society or culture (and thus indirectly the individual). This is, you might say, the ‘New Seekers theory’ of music’s origins: ‘I’d like to teach the world to sing’.

9. just as a journey is not made from trees and rocks and sky, music is not a series of acoustic facts; in fact, it is not acoustic at all. I can’t emphasize this enough. It is fine to call music ‘organized sound’, so long as we recognize that this organization is not determined solely by the composer or performer: it emerges from a collaboration in which the listener too plays an active part.

They seem to stimulate strange psychological responses, particularly feelings of unease, revulsion, anxiety and awe, and have been credited with inducing ‘supernatural’ experiences. Infrasound has been used for its unsettling effect in some contemporary music, for example in the soundtrack to the French shocker movie Irréversible. As a way of using music to induce emotion, that somehow seems like cheating.

11. The human male speaking voice has a typical frequency of around 110 Hz, and the female voice an octave higher, 220 Hz; so when men and women sing together ‘in unison’, they are actually singing in octave harmony.

   - Page: 43

12. octave equivalence is deeply strange. It is a perceptual experience unique to music: there is no analogous repeat pattern in visual perception, or in taste.* In what way is middle C ‘like’ the C above or below it – what quality remains unchanged? Most people would say ‘they sound the same’ – but what does that mean? Clearly they are not the same. Perhaps one might say that the two notes sound good or pleasing together, but that only generates more questions.
   - Location: 741-744
   - Page: 49

13. Just about every musical system that we know of is based on a division of pitch space into octaves: it seems to be a fundamental characteristic of human pitch perception. We’ll see later the likely reason why.

## The Human Factor in a Mission to Mars: An Interdisciplinary Approach
**Author:** Konrad Szocik

### Highlights (26)

1. Abstract The first voyagers who venture to Mars and seek to live on soil beyond our terrestrial home will face an environment mismatched with the one in which their genomes, epigenomes, and psyches evolved. Even if technical hurdles are circumvented to provide adequate resources for basic physiological needs, Homo sapiens will not survive on an alien land if a fracturing psychology prohibits the utilization of these resources. Environmental psychology can be employed to shape the choice architecture of a vessel to Mars and a colony upon it, in order to bias choices toward the fulfillment of fundamental existential, relationship, safety, and fitness needs. Aspects of surroundings that should be engineered to create psychological states optimal for survival and welfare include primes, defaults, private spaces, shared spaces, ceiling height, object shape, color, nature, pets, light, windows, noise, temperature, odors, contaminants, order, and diversions. No matter how far we soar into the stars, our psychologies will be ever tethered to the totality of our surroundings. By shaping our environments, we indirectly shape our psyches and prepare them for a mission of unprecedented alienation and duration which might be the last best hope to avert the end of our kind.
   - Location: 181-190
   - Page: 12

2. Environmental psychology refers to how our surroundings affect our psyches and behavior (Ittelson et al. 1974). Physical structures can enable and influence the likelihood of thoughts, moods, and behaviors. Anyone who had stood within the awe-inspiring cathedrals of Europe , or stood before the Great Buddha of Thailand , can appreciate how architecture can elevate the psyche. In contrast, anyone who has spent time living in the cramped quarters of an inner city dwelling can understand how architecture can also discourage and depress. We exist not as brains in a vacuum but as nodes in an inextricably interconnected system of connections and inputs which affect us. Like cells whose responses can only be truly described in the context of their extracellular environments, we can only truly describe our own thoughts, moods, and behavior in the context of the other minds and things which surround us.
   - Location: 252-259
   - Page: 17

3. Choice architecture is a related concept and refers to the design of how different choices are presented to us which can make it more or less likely for us to choose a certain path (Scheibehenne et al. 2010). Sometimes, the arrangement of these choices can actually be embedded within the physical architecture of our surroundings, and this is where environmental psychology and choice architecture converge. For instance, placing your refrigerator and pantry in your bedroom, as opposed to placing your refrigerator and pantry far away from your bedroom—across the house inside your garage—will strongly influence your decision whether to engage in late night snacking or not.
   - Location: 259-264
   - Page: 17

4. The design of our surroundings can influence our choices in numerous subtle ways. Simply etching the image of a black housefly into a urinal causes bathroom patrons to hit their target 80% more often (Pollack 2012). Beyond this crude example, simple architectural choice can influence countless behaviors through various means.
   - Location: 264-267
   - Page: 18

5. It may be more accurate and less authoritarian, to conceptualize our surroundings as retaining the potential to strongly determine our thoughts, mood, and behavior, as opposed to absolutely determining them.
   - Location: 269-271
   - Page: 18

6. An early application of environmental psychology concepts was the Panopticon, a design for a prison facility described by Jeremy Bentham in a 1798 essay (Bentham 1798). The goal of the Panopticon was to engender in the inmates a feeling that the authorities were virtually omniscient, and could be watching the prisoners at any moment. To achieve this, the Panopticon was designed as a circular building with the prisoners in the circumference and the guards in the center. The design maximizes visibility of the prisoners by the guards but through various architectural contrivances, largely shields the guards from the view of the prisoners (Foucault 1979; Johnston 2000; Semple 1993). Only a few Panopticons were built, but a recent design, the Federal Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Chicago , seemed to draw upon its concepts. The Chicago MCC was shaped like an equilateral triangle with the guard station in the middle. Almost all spaces outside of sleeping quarters could be viewed from the guard station.

7. Environmental psychology and choice architecture was integral to the computer game SimCity, which was inspired by Christopher Alexander’s 1977 book on architecture and urban design entitled A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction (Alexander et al. 1977).
   - Location: 294-296

8. Priming influences behavior by exposing a person to one stimulus, which then biases his or her response to subsequent stimuli. In one experiment demonstrating how powerful priming can be, students were given a task where they had to create four word sentences from lists of five words. For example, the five words “from are Florida oranges temperature,” would be rearranged to form the sentence “Oranges are from Florida.” After completing the task for lists of five words, the students left the room. The time it took for them to walk down the hall was secretly measured. It turned out that students who had been given words associated with old age such as “Florida ”, “forgetful”, “bald”, “gray”, or “wrinkle”, walked down the hall much more slowly than students who did not rearrange such words. Although none of the students reported noticing that the words had a common theme, they were subconsciously influenced to move in a way associated with old age (Bargh, 1996).
   - Location: 310-317

9. 1.4  Defaults We tend to make decisions based on certain cognitive rules of thumb or heuristics (Tversky and Kahneman 1974). The environment can be shaped to bias decision-making especially when the shaping is in accordance with these heuristics. One heuristic is the status quo bias. This is the tendency for us to accept the default position, to succumb to the inertia of our circumstances and surroundings (Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988).
   - Location: 363-367
   - Page: 24

10. Since the default setting, i.e., what choice comes first, must be decided upon anyways, and if architecture signals us to act in one way or another, defaults can be used to benefit the group by strengthening individual health, encouraging consideration for others, and conserving resources. For instance, in public bathrooms in the United States , water spigots are often programmed to default to shutting off after a few seconds of running, to conserve water. Defaults can be used to maintain freedom of choice—a person can still push the button and receive more water if she wants, after the spigot had been programmed to stop, while biasing choice in one direction. On a Mars mission and colony , this biasing will be toward decisions that promulgate the survival and welfare of the community.
   - Location: 372-377
   - Page: 25

11. The status quo bias may partly exist because of another heuristic that makes us loss averse. To simplify what the loss aversion heuristic is all about, imagine having five dollars and then losing it. Now imagine a different scenario where you gained five dollars. You would be much more upset if you lost five dollars than you would be happy in gaining five dollars. Losing something you already have makes you (approximately) twice as upset as gaining that thing would make you happy. In the case of the status quo bias, the thing lost is the default option that you started with. In one experiment on loss aversion, some students were given mugs and some were not. Those with mugs demanded roughly twice as much money to part with their mug, as the students without the mugs were willing to pay to get one (Kahneman et al. 1990).

12. 1.7  Ceiling Height Ceiling height may affect thinking style. In one experiment, people in rooms with lofty ceilings engaged in more abstract forms of thinking, able to expand their viewpoint and engage in more relational processing between different items and concepts (Meyers-Levy and Rui 2007). In contrast, people in rooms with low ceilings engaged in more item-specific processing, where they directed their attention on a single focal point.

14. An analysis of a decade of stays at one major hospital showed that surgical patients assigned to rooms with windows overlooking natural scenery had shorter postoperative hospital stays and took fewer potent analgesics than patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall (Ulrich 1984, 1999).

In another study, appendectomy patients in hospital rooms with plants and flowers had significantly less intake of postoperative analgesics, more positive physiological responses evidenced by lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and lower ratings of pain, anxiety, and fatigue (Park and Mattson 2008).

18. Inhaling green odor (a 50:50 mixture of trans-2-hexenal and cis-3-hexenol) has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the stress-induced activation of the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenocortical axis in humans (Oka et al. 2008), and to alleviate stress-induced cardiovascular, hormonal, and behavioral responses in rats (Ito et al. 2009; Nikaido and Nakashima 2009).

19. researchers found that rats who were experimentally induced to have depressive states through two behavioral models of depression had ameliorated depressive symptoms upon inhaling green odor, compared to rats that did not (Watanabe et al. 2011). Rats who inhaled the green odor had increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal regions. Increased neural connections due to stimulation by BDNF are thought to be necessary for antidepressants which increase monoamine levels to exert their effects.

22. A modality for service delivery that can withstand the communication delay is an exchange based on journaling. This is the practice of writing down the difficult and pleasant parts of one’s life, and its tradition dates back at least as far as tenth-century Japan. Self-reflection on the joys and woes of the day is also evident in the mental “examination of consciousness,” an exercise introduced by Ignatius of Loyola , the founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) . Journaling has certainly been found to be effective, but focusing on factual understandings as well as emotional reactions is important for its success (Ullrich and Lutgendorf 2002). A journaling correspondent on Earth could be chosen from a wider pool of people, although a close friend might be found among the crew. There are obstacles to journaling on Mars. The physical writing, with pen and paper, seems important to journaling for many people. Among Mars crew, laptops and tablets will have to suffice, although touch screens may help to solve this problem. It is true that some people simply do not take to journaling, whatever encouragement they receive. Snyder (2013) has reviewed the practice of journaling and suggested alternatives, such as art. Mars mission planners could incorporate forms of art and even an “art area” in the Mars living facility, with the goal of self-expression. This type of “psychological self-service” may sound elementary now, but if it prevents destructive forms of emotional expression, it will be well worth it. Engineers, military officers, and pilots will dominate the profiles of Mars crew. They are considered low in self-disclosure ability, although this may be a result of being in maledominated occupations. Dindia and Allen (1992) have a comprehensive study showing that women are marginally more self-disclosing than men. Perhaps journaling is not for the average Mars crew, nor group therapy. However, even crew in these occupations can come to realize that, as Tamir and Mitchell (2012) claim, disclosing information about the self is intrinsically rewarding.

23. It has been found that social robots, like a robotic dog, are as effective as a real dog in reducing loneliness (Banks et al. 2008). Animal-assisted therapy with social robots can currently provide examples that may be transferable to Mars crew . Aaron Horowitz’s robot duck , based on the duck that advertises for Aflac, is charming and effective (Holland 2018). Children communicate with social robots on a peer-to-peer basis and use them to express their feelings more freely. The article recalls that Jerry the Bear, an interactive companion for children with diabetes, was a predecessor to the duck. Experimentation by Japanese researchers started at AIST back in 1993 with Paro, a baby seal, again very cute, with big appealing eyes and soft fur, which was effective in reducing stress (Birks et al. 2016). Less expensive than these is Hasbro’s Cat, now used with seniors (Newman 2016).

24. An earlier study of “Ellie,” an avatar-like female on a screen, showed something very interesting: People were more willing to reveal themselves when they were told Ellie was totally a robot than when they were told, falsely, that it was just an electronic puppet for a human therapist (Lucas et al. 2014). An extension of the Ellie study (Pickard et al. 2016) showed that the more sensitive the information they revealed, the more comfortable the people were with Virtual Humans (VHs). This may be the solution to those reluctant to self-disclose, who may predominate in the Mars crew.

26. Research on mankind’s restricted gene variation indicates that humans migrated out of Africa about 88,000 years ago and at some stage before that our numbers may have dwindled to as low as two thousand. Some geneticists hypothesize that this bottleneck was caused by the explosion of the Toba super-volcano in Indonesia and resulting major environmental change (Templeton 2007).

## The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas About the Origins of the Universe
**Author:** John D. Barrow

### Highlights (22)

1. Elbert Hubbard’s elegantly bound Essay on Silence contains only blank pages, as does a chapter in the autobiography of the English footballer Len Shackleton which bears the title ‘What the average director knows about football’. An empty volume, entitled The Nothing Book, was published in 1974 and appeared in several editions and even withstood a breach of copyright action by the author of another book of blank pages.

2. The most obvious defining feature of our system of counting is its use of a base of ten. We count in tens. Ten ones make ten; ten tens make one hundred; and so on. This choice of base was made by many cultures and its source is clearly to be found close at hand with our ten fingers, the first counters. Sometimes one finds this base is mixed in with uses of 20 as a base (fingers plus toes) in more advanced cultures, whilst less advanced counting systems might make use of a base of two or five.6 The exceptions are so rare as to be worth mentioning. In America one finds an Indian counting system based on a base of eight. At first this seems very odd, until you realise that they were also finger counters – it is just that they counted the eight gaps between the fingers instead of the ten fingers.

3. We have seen that our numerical zero derives originally from the Hindu sunya, meaning void or emptiness, deriving from the Sanskrit name for the mark denoting emptiness, or sunya-bindu, meaning an empty dot. These developed between the sixth and eighth centuries. By the ninth century, the assimilation of Indian mathematics by the Arab world led to the literal translation of sunya into Arabic as as-sifr, which also means ‘empty’ or the ‘absence of anything’. We still see a residue of this because it is the origin of the English word ‘cipher’. Originally, it meant ‘Nothing’, or if used insultingly of a person it would mean that they were a nonentity – a nobody

4. The Arab word sifr was first transcribed into medieval Latin in the thirteenth century in the two forms cifra or zefirum, and into Greek as τσιφρα, which led to their use of the letter tau, τ, as an abbreviation for zero. But the two Latin words acquired quite different meanings. The word zefirum (or cefirum, as Leonardo of Pisa46 wrote it in the thirteenth century) kept its original meaning of zero. In fourteenth-century Italian, this second form changed to zefiro, zefro or zevero, which was eventually shortened in the Venetian dialect to zero which we still use in English and French. This same type of editing down was what reduced the currency from libra to livra to lira. By contrast, the word cifra acquired a more general meaning: it was used to denote any of the ten numerals 0, 1, 2, …, 9. From

5. The more conventional view is that formal infinities are all right in mathematics but you must be very careful how you handle them. They do not obey the usual laws of arithmetic for finite quantities. Take an infinity away from an infinity and you can still be left with infinity: for example, the list of all whole numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …) contains an infinite number of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, …) and an infinite number of even numbers6 (2, 4, 6, 8, …). Take the infinite number of odd numbers away from the infinity of all numbers and you are left with an infinity of even numbers!

8. The average density of a planet or a star like the Sun is close to one gram per cubic centimetre, which means about 1024 atoms per cubic centimetre. This is roughly the density of things we encounter around us. This is vastly greater than the average density of the Universe. If we were to smooth out all the luminous material in the visible universe then we would find only about one atom in every cubic metre of space. This is a far better vacuum than we can make in any terrestrial laboratory by artificial means.

9. we are forced to accept that the dark material that dominates the content of outer space must be another form of matter entirely. The favourite candidate is a population of neutrino-like particles (called WIMPS = weakly interacting massive particles), heavier than ordinary protons and more numerous.

10. Atoms and molecules, and even neutrino-like particles, are far from all there is pervading outer space. Radiation exists in all wavelengths. The most pervasive and the most significant contributor to the total energy density of the Universe is the sea of microwave photons left over from the hot early stages of the Universe. As the Universe has expanded, these photons have lost energy, increased in wavelength and cooled to a temperature only 2.7 degrees above absolute zero. There are about 411 of these photons in every cubic centimetre of space. That is, there are roughly one billion of these photons for every atom in the Universe.

13. The most awkward feature of these attempts to evade casting out the ether was the need to distinguish between a system that was moving and one that was not in some absolute sense. It is all very well to enter a value for v which corresponds to the Earth’s orbital velocity around the Sun in the FitzGerald contraction formula, but what if the Sun and its local group of stars are themselves in motion? What velocity do we use for v and with respect to what do we measure it?

14. During the nineteenth century, mathematics began to move in a new direction and its scope expanded beyond the paths mapped out by the ancients. For them, mathematics provided a way of making precise statements about quantities, lines, angles and points. It was divided into arithmetic, algebra and geometry, and formed a vital part of the ancient curriculum because it offered something that only theology would also dare to claim – a glimpse into the realm of absolute truth. The most important exemplar was geometry. It was the most impressive and powerful instrument wielded by mathematicians. Euclid created a beautiful framework of axioms and deductions that led to truths called ‘theorems’. These truths led to new knowledge of the motions of the planets, new techniques for engineering and art; Newton’s greatest insights were achieved by means of geometry. Geometry was not seen as merely an approximation to the true nature of things, it was part of the absolute truth about the Universe.

15. Boole defined two simple ways of creating new sets from old. Given two sets A and B, the union of A and B, written A∪B, consists of all members of A together with all members of B; the intersection of A and B, written A∩B, is the set containing all the members common to both A and B. If A and B have no members in common they are said to be disjoint: their union is empty.

19. Despite their popular image, black holes are not necessarily solid objects possessing enormous densities. The huge black holes that seem to be lurking at the centres of many large galaxies have masses about a billion times larger than that of the Sun, but their average density is only about that of air.41 We could be passing through the event horizon of one of these vast black holes at this very moment and nothing would seem strange. No alarms bells would ring as we crossed the horizon and we wouldn’t be torn apart.42 Later on, it would: gradually we would find ourselves drawn inexorably towards conditions of increasing density at the centre. If we ever tried to reverse our path, we would find that there was a definite limit to how far back we could get and none of the signals beamed back to base outside the hole would ever be received.

22. The inclusion of just one contradiction (like 0 = 1) in an axiomatic system allows any statement about the objects in the system to be proved true (and also proved false). When Bertrand Russell26 pointed this out in a lecture he was once challenged by a heckler demanding that he show how the questioner could be proved to be the Pope if 2 + 2 = 5. Russell replied immediately that ‘if twice 2 is 5, then 4 is 5, subtract 3; then 1 = 2. But you and the Pope are 2; therefore you and the Pope are 1’! A contradictory statement is the ultimate Trojan horse.

## Deep Medicine
**Author:** Eric Topol

### Highlights (48)

1. In medicine, we often rely on changes in the frequency of so-called surrogate endpoints instead of the frequency of endpoints that really matter. So with heart disease we might treat based on changes in blood pressure because we have no evidence about whether the treatment actually changes the frequency of heart attacks, strokes, or death. Or we might measure the treatment of diabetes by monitoring changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) instead of life expectancy and widely accepted quality-of-life measures. Although the surrogate symptoms might seem like reasonable stand-ins for the overarching goals, very few of them have held up to scrutiny. Nevertheless, the flimsy evidence that caused physicians to monitor the surrogates in the first place has bred overuse of tests, procedures, and medications.

4. In the United States, mammography is recommended annually for women in their fifties. The total cost of the screening alone is more than $10 billion per year. Worse, if we consider 10,000 women in their fifties who have mammography each year for ten years, only five (0.05 percent) avoid a breast cancer death, while more than 6,000 (60 percent) will have at least one false positive result.14 The latter might result in the harm and expense of a number of unnecessary procedures, including biopsies, surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy; at the very least, it results in considerable fear and anxiety.

6. Surprisingly, there is no system in place for doctors to get feedback on their diagnostic skills during their careers, either. In Superforecasting, Philip Tetlock observes, “If you don’t get feedback, your confidence grows much faster than your accuracy.”

7. There are about 10,000 human diseases, and there’s not a doctor who could recall any significant fraction of them. If doctors can’t remember a possible diagnosis when making up a differential, then they will diagnose according to the possibilities that are mentally “available” to them, and an error can result. This is called the availability bias.

12. Some experts believe that deep learning has hit its limits and it’ll be hard-pressed to go beyond the current level of narrow functionality. Geoffrey Hinton, the father of deep learning, has even called the entire methodology into question.8 Although he invented backpropagation, the method for error correction in neural networks, he recently said he had become “deeply suspicious” of backprop, saying his view had become that we should “throw it all away and start again.”9 Pointing to the technology’s reliance on extensive labeling, he projected that the inefficiencies resulting from that dependence “may lead to their demise.”10 Hinton is intent on narrowing the chasm between AI and children and has introduced the concept of capsule networks.

13. A radiologist reads about 20,000 studies a year, which equates to somewhere between 50–100 per day, a number that has been steadily increasing.8 While X-rays are single-digit images per exam, ultrasounds are dozens, and CT scans and MRIs are hundreds, a ratio that keeps increasing. All told, there are more than 800 million medical scans a year in the United States, which amounts to about 60 billion images, or one image generated every two seconds.

14. Much like radiologists, pathologists have had no real face to patients. It’s their doctor who relays the report, and their doctor often has little appreciation for the nuances involved in the interpretation of a path specimen. Establishing direct patient contact to review the results could be transformative both for pathologists and for patients and their physicians. The remarkable AI parallels for radiology and pathology led Saurabh Jha and me to write an essay in JAMA about the “information specialists.”59 Recognizing that many tasks for both specialties will be handled by AI and the fundamental likeness of these specialists, we proposed a unified discipline. This could be considered a natural fusion that could be achieved by a joint training program and accreditation that emphasizes AI, deep learning, data science, and Bayesian logic rather than pattern recognition. The board-certified information specialist would become an invaluable player on the healthcare team.

15. In the real world of dermatology, it isn’t just a look at a lesion that is telling. The history of the lesion, the individual’s risk factors, a more extensive assessment of the whole skin of the patient are all in the domain of information the dermatologists acquire during a visit. Furthermore, it’s not just a binary call of cancer or not cancer but the decision to simply monitor the lesion over time before deciding to do a biopsy.

16. UNLIKE INFORMATION SPECIALISTS, MOST PHYSICIANS, NURSES, and clinicians do not have what I’d call pattern-centric practices. Most primary care and specialties involve pattern-heavy elements such as scans or slides, to be sure, but their predominant function is making an assessment and formulating a plan. This involves integration; cognitive processing of the patient’s history; physical, lab, and other objective data (such as the scans and slides interpreted by information specialists); the corpus of the medical literature; and communication with the patient and family. The practice of these clinicians defies a simple pattern. While deep learning thrives on inputs and outputs, most of medical practice defies straightforward algorithmic processing. For these “clinicians without patterns,” AI presents adjunctive opportunities, offsetting certain functions that are more efficiently handled by machines. The range is exceptionally broad—from eliminating the use of a keyboard to processing multimodal data.

17. When electronic health records first arrived, a new industry of human scribes was birthed to preserve the human interaction between patient and doctor by outsourcing the keyboard function to a third party. ScribeAmerica is now the largest of more than twenty companies providing transcription services to health systems and clinics throughout the United States. By 2016, there were more than 20,000 scribes employed and a projection that there would be a demand for more than 100,000 by 2020—that’s one scribe for every seven physicians.1 Having a scribe at the keyboard has been associated with multiple reports of improved satisfaction for both patients and doctors. But it’s hardly a full remedy. Adding a substantial number of full-time employees exacerbates the exorbitant costs of electronic health information systems such as Epic or Cerner. Beyond that, the presence of an extra, unfamiliar person in the room can interfere with a patient having an intimate conversation with a physician.

19. The NLP-visit record might still prove to be suboptimal. Beyond the technical challenge of transcribing unstructured language into a succinct but complete note, there are the missing pieces. All the nonverbal communication would be lost, for example. The knowledge that everything was going to be taped, archived, and parts would be incorporated into the note might well inhibit an informal, free conversation. AI is actively being pursued for this application despite uncertainty that it will ultimately prove widely acceptable.

21. plenty of information is hidden inside the so-called normal range. Take a male patient whose hemoglobin has steadily declined over the past five years, from 15.9 to 13.2 g/dl. Both the starting and end points are within the normal range, so such a change would never get flagged by lab reports, and most busy doctors wouldn’t connect the dots of looking back over an extended period. But such a decrement could be an early sign of a disease process in the individual, whether it be hidden bleeding or cancer.

23. In 2018, I visited the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, one of the most highly regarded eye centers in the world. Pearse Keane, a pioneering ophthalmologist there, performed my eye exam with optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Figure 7.2). As opposed to head-on images of the retinal fundus, which were used in the diabetic retinopathy studies, the OCT images are cross sections of the retinal tissue. This sounds pretty fancy, but the images were simply obtained by resting my head on a machine and having my retina scanned by an array of light, one eye at a time. The image was ready to review in less than a minute. Keane developed a collaboration with DeepMind AI to build a deep learning algorithm that could help with more than 1 million high resolution 3-D OCT exams per year that are done at Moorfields. The algorithm can accurately diagnose most retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, well before symptoms may be present. In a collaborative study between Moorfields and DeepMind, involving more than 14,000 OCT images, automated OCT interpretation was at least as accurate as expert retinal specialists for analysis and triage for urgent referral of more than fifty types of eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.16 There was not a single case in which the patient had a serious eye condition, but the algorithm recommended just observation. The algorithm’s AUC for false alarm was 0.992. In contrast, the clinicians only agreed on 65 percent of the referral decisions. Keane told me that OCT should be part of every eye exam. That is certainly not the case in the United States today, but the prospective validation of the algorithm, which is currently underway in a clinical trial led by Keane, may lead to that standard practice in the future.

34. Until now in medicine, there has been a reductionist point of view.40 That was evident with the Human Genome Project, whose premise was that understanding genomic variation would inform each individual’s risk of diseases and treatments. This exemplified linear thinking, not appreciating the complex nature of health and diseases, and the multidimensional interactions with our microbiome, immune system, epigenome, social network, and environment (and more).

36. There are major nonscientific challenges as well—the biggest is having all of a person’s data. The notion that the electronic health record is the hallowed knowledge resource for each patient is a major problem. As we’ve seen, that couldn’t be further from the truth.

39. Time is essential to the quality of care patients receive and to their health outcomes. The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper in 2018 by Elena Andreyeva and her colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania that studied the effect of the length of home health visits for patients who had been discharged from hospitals after treatment for acute conditions. Based on more than 60,000 visits by nurses, physical therapists, and other clinicians, they found that for every extra minute that a visit lasts, there was a reduction in risk of readmission of 8 percent.6 For part-time providers, the decrease in hospital readmission was 16 percent per extra minute; for nurses in particular it was a 13 percent reduction per minute.

40. In 1895, William Osler wrote, “A case cannot be satisfactorily examined in less than half an hour. A sick man likes to have plenty of time spent over him, and he gets no satisfaction in a hurried ten or twelve minute examination.”7 That’s true 120 years later. And it will always be true.

41. AI can help achieve the gift of time with patients. In 2018, the Institute for Public Policy Research published an extensive report on the impact of AI and technology titled “Better Health and Care for All,” projecting the potential time freed up for care of patients will average more than 25 percent across various types of clinicians.13 One of the most important effects will come from unshackling clinicians from electronic health records. At the University of Colorado, taking the computer out of the exam room and supporting doctors with human medical assistants led to a striking reduction in physician burnout, from 53 percent to 13 percent.14 There’s no reason to think that using natural-language processing during patient encounters couldn’t have the same effect. But the tech solution per se won’t work unless there is recognition that medicine is not an assembly line. As Ronald Epstein and Michael Privitera wrote in the Lancet, “Physicians, disillusioned by the productivity orientation of administrators and absence of affirmation for the values and relationships that sustain their sense of purpose, need enlightened leaders who recognize that medicine is a human endeavor and not an assembly line.”15 They’ve got it mostly right: we need everyone on board, not just leaders. If the heightened efficiency is just used by administrators as a means to rev up productivity, so doctors see more patients, read more scans or slides, and maximize throughput, there will be no gift of time. It’s entirely possible that this will happen: it was, after all, doctors themselves who allowed the invasion of grossly inadequate electronic health records into the clinic, never standing up to companies like Epic, which has, in its contracts with hospitals and doctors, a gag clause that prohibits them from disparaging electronic health records or even publishing EHR screenshots.

These features are the seeds for trust, for providing comfort and promoting a sense of healing. They are the building blocks that enable genuine caring for the patient and a doctor’s professional fulfillment that comes from improving a person’s life. All these humanistic interactions are difficult to quantify or digitize, which further highlights why doctors are irreplaceable by machines.

46. If you’ve ever experienced deep pain, you know how lonely and isolating it is, how no one can really know what you are feeling, the anguish, the sense of utter despair. You can be comforted by a loved one, a friend or relative, and that certainly helps. But it’s hard to beat the boost from a doctor or clinician you trust and who can bolster your confidence that it will pass, that he or she will be with you no matter what. That you’ll be okay. That’s the human caring we desperately seek when we’re sick. That’s what AI can help restore.

## The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect
**Author:** Judea Pearl;Dana Mackenzie

### Highlights (45)

1. In Statistics 101, every student learns to chant, “Correlation is not causation.” With good reason! The rooster’s crow is highly correlated with the sunrise; yet it does not cause the sunrise. Unfortunately, statistics has fetishized this commonsense observation. It tells us that correlation is not causation, but it does not tell us what causation is. In vain will you search the index of a statistics textbook for an entry on “cause.” Students are not allowed to say that X is the cause of Y—only that X and Y are “related” or “associated.”
   - Location: 140-144
   - Page: 10

2. The calculus of causation consists of two languages: causal diagrams, to express what we know, and a symbolic language, resembling algebra, to express what we want to know. The causal diagrams are simply dot-and-arrow pictures that summarize our existing scientific knowledge. The dots represent quantities of interest, called “variables,” and the arrows represent known or suspected causal relationships between those variables—namely, which variable “listens” to which others.
   - Location: 170-173
   - Page: 12

3. Side by side with this diagrammatic “language of knowledge,” we also have a symbolic “language of queries” to express the questions we want answers to. For example, if we are interested in the effect of a drug (D) on lifespan (L), then our query might be written symbolically as: P(L | do(D)). In other words, what is the probability (P) that a typical patient would survive L years if made to take the drug? This question describes what epidemiologists would call an intervention or a treatment and corresponds to what we measure in a clinical trial. In many cases we may also wish to compare P(L | do(D)) with P(L | do(not-D)); the latter describes patients denied treatment, also called the “control” patients. The do-operator signifies that we are dealing with an intervention rather than a passive observation; classical statistics has nothing remotely similar to this operator. We must invoke an intervention operator do(D) to ensure that the observed change in Lifespan L is due to the drug itself and is not confounded with other factors that tend to shorten or lengthen life. If, instead of intervening, we let the patient himself decide whether to take the drug, those other factors might influence his decision, and lifespan differences between taking and not taking the drug would no longer be solely due to the drug. For example, suppose only those who were terminally ill took the drug. Such persons would surely differ from those who did not take the drug, and a comparison of the two groups would reflect differences in the severity of their disease rather than the effect of the drug. By contrast, forcing patients to take or refrain from taking the drug, regardless of preconditions, would wash away preexisting differences and provide a valid comparison. Mathematically, we write the observed frequency of Lifespan L among patients who voluntarily take the drug as P(L | D), which is the standard conditional probability used in statistical textbooks. This expression stands for the probability (P) of Lifespan L conditional on seeing the patient take Drug D. Note that P(L | D) may be totally different from P(L | do(D)). This difference between seeing and doing is fundamental and explains why we do not regard the falling barometer to be a cause of the coming storm. Seeing the barometer fall increases the probability of the storm, while forcing it to fall does not affect this probability.

4. When the scientific question of interest involves retrospective thinking, we call on another type of expression unique to causal reasoning called a counterfactual. For example, suppose that Joe took Drug D and died a month later; our question of interest is whether the drug might have caused his death. To answer this question, we need to imagine a scenario in which Joe was about to take the drug but changed his mind. Would he have lived?

8. Various options exist for causal models: causal diagrams, structural equations, logical statements, and so forth. I am strongly sold on causal diagrams for nearly all applications, primarily due to their transparency but also due to the explicit answers they provide to many of the questions we wish to ask.

9. the definition of “causation” is simple, if a little metaphorical: a variable X is a cause of Y if Y “listens” to X and determines its value in response to what it hears.

10. many researchers in artificial intelligence would like to skip the hard step of constructing or acquiring a causal model and rely solely on data for all cognitive tasks. The hope—and at present, it is usually a silent one—is that the data themselves will guide us to the right answers whenever causal questions come up. I am an outspoken skeptic of this trend because I know how profoundly dumb data are about causes and effects.

   - Location: 331-332

12. Another advantage causal models have that data mining and deep learning lack is adaptability. Note that in Figure I.1, the estimand is computed on the basis of the causal model alone, prior to an examination of the specifics of the data. This makes the causal inference engine supremely adaptable, because the estimand computed is good for any data that are compatible with the qualitative model, regardless of the numerical relationships among the variables.

15. I fully agree with Gary Marcus, a neuroscientist at New York University, who recently wrote in the New York Times that the field of artificial intelligence is “bursting with microdiscoveries”—the sort of things that make good press releases—but machines are still disappointingly far from humanlike cognition.

16. My colleague in computer science at the University of California, Los Angeles, Adnan Darwiche, has titled a position paper “Human-Level Intelligence or Animal-Like Abilities?” which I think frames the question in just the right way.

19. Decades’ worth of experience with these kinds of questions has convinced me that, in both a cognitive and a philosophical sense, the idea of causes and effects is much more fundamental than the idea of probability. We begin learning causes and effects before we understand language and before we know any mathematics. (Research has shown that three-year-olds already understand the entire Ladder of Causation.) Likewise, the knowledge conveyed in a causal diagram is typically much more robust than that encoded in a probability distribution. For example, suppose that times have changed and a much safer and more effective vaccine is introduced. Suppose, further, that due to improved hygiene and socioeconomic conditions, the danger of contracting smallpox has diminished. These changes will drastically affect all the probabilities involved; yet, remarkably, the structure of the diagram will remain invariant. This is the key secret of causal modeling. Moreover, once we go through the analysis and find how to estimate the benefit of vaccination from data, we do not have to repeat the entire analysis from scratch. As discussed in the Introduction, the same estimand (i.e., recipe for answering the query) will remain valid and, as long as the diagram does not change, can be applied to the new data and produce a new estimate for our query. It is because of this robustness, I conjecture, that human intuition is organized around causal, not statistical, relations.

20. For the first time, Galton’s idea of correlation gave an objective measure, independent of human judgment or interpretation, of how two variables are related to one another. The two variables can stand for height, intelligence, or income; they can stand in causal, neutral, or reverse-causal relation. The correlation will always reflect the degree of cross predictability between the two variables. Galton’s disciple Karl Pearson later derived a formula for the slope of the (properly rescaled) regression line and called it the correlation coefficient. This is still the first number that statisticians all over the world compute when they want to know how strongly two different variables in a data set are related. Galton and Pearson must have been thrilled to find such a universal way of describing the relationships between random variables. For Pearson, especially, the slippery old concepts of cause and effect seemed outdated and unscientific, compared to the mathematically clear and precise concept of a correlation coefficient.

22. Many people still make Niles’s mistake of thinking that the goal of causal analysis is to prove that X is a cause of Y or else to find the cause of Y from scratch. That is the problem of causal discovery, which was my ambitious dream when I first plunged into graphical modeling and is still an area of vigorous research. In contrast, the focus of Wright’s research, as well as this book, is representing plausible causal knowledge in some mathematical language, combining it with empirical data, and answering causal queries that are of practical value. Wright understood from the very beginning that causal discovery was much more difficult and perhaps impossible.

24. “IT’S elementary, my dear Watson.” So spoke Sherlock Holmes (at least in the movies) just before dazzling his faithful assistant with one of his famously nonelementary deductions. But in fact, Holmes performed not just deduction, which works from a hypothesis to a conclusion. His great skill was induction, which works in the opposite direction, from evidence to hypothesis. Another of his famous quotes suggests his modus operandi: “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Having induced several hypotheses, Holmes eliminated them one by one in order to deduce (by elimination) the correct one. Although induction and deduction go hand in hand, the former is by far the more mysterious. This fact kept detectives like Sherlock Holmes in business. However, in recent years experts in artificial intelligence (AI) have made considerable progress toward automating the process of reasoning from evidence to hypothesis and likewise from effect to cause. I was fortunate enough to participate in the very earliest stages of this progress by developing one of its basic tools, called Bayesian networks.

25. Bayes didn’t need the help. His paper is remembered and argued about 250 years later, not for its theology but because it shows that you can deduce the probability of a cause from an effect. If we know the cause, it is easy to estimate the probability of the effect, which is a forward probability. Going the other direction—a problem known in Bayes’s time as “inverse probability”—is harder.

26. This example shows that P(disease | test) is not the same for everyone; it is context dependent. If you know that you are at high risk for a disease to begin with, Bayes’s rule allows you to factor that information in. Or if you know that you are immune, you need not even bother with the test! In contrast, P(test | disease) does not depend on whether you are at high risk or not. It is “robust” to such variations, which explains to some degree why physicians organize their knowledge and communicate with forward probabilities. The former are properties of the disease itself, its stage of progression, or the sensitivity of the detecting instruments; hence they remain relatively invariant to the reasons for the disease (epidemic, diet, hygiene, socioeconomic status, family history). The inverse probability, P(disease | test), is sensitive to these conditions.

27. Perhaps without realizing it, we deal with exceptions to rules and uncertainties in evidence all the time. By 1980, it was clear that expert systems struggled with making correct inferences from uncertain knowledge. The computer could not replicate the inferential process of a human expert because the experts themselves were not able to articulate their thinking process within the language provided by the system.

28. The late 1970s, then, were a time of ferment in the AI community over the question of how to deal with uncertainty. There was no shortage of ideas. Lotfi Zadeh of Berkeley offered “fuzzy logic,” in which statements are neither true nor false but instead take a range of possible truth values. Glen Shafer of the University of Kansas proposed “belief functions,” which assign two probabilities to each fact, one indicating how likely it is to be “possible,” the other, how likely it is to be “provable.” Edward Feigenbaum and his colleagues at Stanford University tried “certainty factors,” which inserted numerical measures of uncertainty into their deterministic rules for inference. Unfortunately, although ingenious, these approaches suffered a common flaw: they modeled the expert, not the world, and therefore tended to produce unintended results. For example, they could not operate in both diagnostic and predictive modes, the uncontested specialty of Bayes’s rule. In the certainty factor approach, the rule “If fire, then smoke (with certainty c1)” could not combine coherently with “If smoke, then fire (with certainty c2)” without triggering a runaway buildup of belief.

29. A B C. This junction is the simplest example of a “chain,” or of mediation. In science, one often thinks of B as the mechanism, or “mediator,” that transmits the effect of A to C. A familiar example is Fire Smoke Alarm.

30. 2. A B C. This kind of junction is called a “fork,” and B is often called a common cause or confounder of A and C. A confounder will make A and C statistically correlated even though there is no direct causal link between them. A good example (due to David Freedman) is Shoe Size Age of Child Reading Ability. Children with larger shoes tend to read at a higher level. But the relationship is not one of cause and effect. Giving a child larger shoes won’t make him read better! Instead, both variables are explained by a third, which is the child’s age.

32. The transparency of Bayesian networks distinguishes them from most other approaches to machine learning, which tend to produce inscrutable “black boxes.” In a Bayesian network you can follow every step and understand how and why each piece of evidence changed the network’s beliefs.

33. Fisher realized that an uncertain answer to the right question is much better than a highly certain answer to the wrong question. If you ask the genie the wrong question, you will never find out what you want to know. If you ask the right question, getting an answer that is occasionally wrong is much less of a problem. You can still estimate the amount of uncertainty in your answer, because the uncertainty comes from the randomization procedure (which is known) rather than the characteristics of the soil (which are unknown).

34. The quantity we observe is the conditional probability of the outcome given the treatment, P(Y | X). The question we want to ask of Nature has to do with the causal relationship between X and Y, which is captured by the interventional probability P(Y | do(X)). Confounding, then, should simply be defined as anything that leads to a discrepancy between the two: P(Y | X) ≠ P(Y | do(X)).

35. If we plot the rates of lung cancer and tobacco consumption on a graph (see Figure 5.2), the connection is impossible to miss. But time series data are poor evidence for causality. Many other things had changed between 1900 and 1950 and were equally plausible culprits: the paving of roads, the inhalation of leaded gasoline fumes, and air pollution in general. British epidemiologist Richard Doll said in 1991, “Motor cars… were a new factor and if I had had to put money on anything at the time, I should have put it on motor exhausts or possibly the tarring of roads.”

37. a number of criteria must be utilized, no one of which is an all-sufficient basis for judgment.” The committee listed five such criteria: consistency (many studies, in different populations, show similar results); strength of association (including the dose-response effect: more smoking is associated with a higher risk); specificity of the association (a particular agent should have a particular effect and not a long litany of effects); temporal relationship (the effect should follow the cause); and coherence (biological plausibility and consistency with other types of evidence such as laboratory experiments and time series).

39. Monty could not open Door 1 after you chose it—but he could have opened Door 2. The fact that he did not makes it more likely that he opened Door 3 because he was forced to. Thus there is more evidence than before that the car is behind Door 2. This is a general theme of Bayesian analysis: any hypothesis that has survived some test that threatens its validity becomes more likely. The greater the threat, the more likely it becomes after surviving. Door 2 was vulnerable to refutation (i.e., Monty could have opened it), but Door 1 was not. Therefore, Door 2 becomes a more likely location, while Door 1 does not. The probability that the car is behind Door 1 remains one in three.

In 1946, Joseph Berkson, a biostatistician at the Mayo Clinic, pointed out a peculiarity of observational studies conducted in a hospital setting: even if two diseases have no relation to each other in the general population, they can appear to be associated among patients in a hospital. To understand Berkson’s observation, let’s start with a causal diagram (Figure 6.3). It’s also helpful to think of a very extreme possibility: neither Disease 1 nor Disease 2 is ordinarily severe enough to cause hospitalization, but the combination is. In this case, we would expect Disease 1 to be highly correlated with Disease 2 in the hospitalized population. FIGURE 6.3. Causal diagram for Berkson’s paradox. By performing a study on patients who are hospitalized, we are controlling for Hospitalization. As we know, conditioning on a collider creates a spurious association between Disease 1 and Disease 2. In many of our previous examples the association was negative because of the explain-away effect, but here it is positive because both diseases have to be present for hospitalization (not just one).

41. Try this experiment: Flip two coins simultaneously one hundred times and write down the results only when at least one of them comes up heads. Looking at your table, which will probably contain roughly seventy-five entries, you will see that the outcomes of the two simultaneous coin flips are not independent. Every time Coin 1 landed tails, Coin 2 landed heads. How is this possible? Did the coins somehow communicate with each other at light speed? Of course not. In reality you conditioned on a collider by censoring all the tails-tails outcomes.

42. As Jordan Ellenberg asks in How Not to Be Wrong, have you ever noticed that, among the people you date, the attractive ones tend to be jerks? Instead of constructing elaborate psychosocial theories, consider a simpler explanation. Your choice of people to date depends on two factors: attractiveness and personality. You’ll take a chance on dating a mean attractive person or a nice unattractive person, and certainly a nice attractive person, but not a mean unattractive person. It’s the same as the two-coin example, when you censored tails-tails outcomes. This creates a spurious negative correlation between attractiveness and personality. The sad truth is that unattractive people are just as mean as attractive people—but you’ll never realize it, because you’ll never date somebody who is both mean and unattractive.

43. Simpson’s reversal is a purely numerical fact: as seen in Table 6.4, it is a reversal in relative frequency of a particular event in two or more different samples upon merging the samples. In our example, we saw that 3/40 > 1/20 (these were the frequencies of heart attack among women with and without Drug D) and 8/20 > 12/40 (the frequencies among men). Yet when we combined women and men, the inequality reversed direction: (3 + 8)/(40 + 20) < (1 + 12)/(20 + 40). If you thought such a reversal mathematically impossible, then you were probably basing your reaction on misapplied or misremembered properties of fractions. Many people seem to believe that if A/B > a/b and C/D > c/d, then it follows that (A + C)/(B + D) > (a + c)/(b + d). But this folk wisdom is simply wrong. The example we have just given refutes it.

44. Like the prisoners in Plato’s famous cave, deep-learning systems explore the shadows on the cave wall and learn to accurately predict their movements. They lack the understanding that the observed shadows are mere projections of three-dimensional objects moving in a three-dimensional space.

45. Not all philosophers are convinced that there really is a clash between free will and determinism. A group called “compatibilists,” among whom I count myself, consider it only an apparent clash between two levels of description: the neural level at which processes appear deterministic (barring quantum indeterminism) and the cognitive level at which we have a vivid sensation of options.

## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life
**Author:** Mark Manson

### Highlights (17)

1. The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.
   - Location: 139-140
   - Page: 10

2. It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.
   - Location: 142-144
   - Page: 10

3. Albert Camus said (and I’m pretty sure he wasn’t on LSD at the time): “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”
   - Location: 150-151
   - Page: 10

4. What’s interesting about the backwards law is that it’s called “backwards” for a reason: not giving a fuck works in reverse. If pursuing the positive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what’s necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.
   - Location: 159-164
   - Page: 11

5. Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.
   - Location: 165-167
   - Page: 11

6. Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
   - Location: 203-204
   - Page: 14

7. There’s no such thing as not giving a fuck. You must give a fuck about something. It’s part of our biology to always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck. The question, then, is, What do we give a fuck about? What are we choosing to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter?
   - Location: 212-215
   - Page: 14

8. Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
   - Location: 234-235
   - Page: 16

9. Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.
   - Location: 253-254

10. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive.
   - Location: 352-353
   - Page: 23

11. Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can’t solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. The secret sauce is in the solving of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place.
   - Location: 392-395
   - Page: 26

12. The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me? This level, which takes constant questioning and effort, is incredibly difficult to reach. But it’s the most important, because our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives. Values underlie everything we are and do. If what we value is unhelpful, if what we consider success/failure is poorly chosen, then everything based upon those values—the thoughts, the emotions, the day-to-day feelings—will all be out of whack. Everything we think and feel about a situation ultimately comes back to how valuable we perceive it to be.
   - Location: 872-878
   - Page: 57

13. The rest of this book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values that I believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt. All follow the “backwards law” we talked about earlier, in that they’re “negative.” All require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs. These five values are both unconventional and uncomfortable. But, to me, they are life-changing. The first, which we’ll look at in the next chapter, is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. The final value is the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.

14. Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it. If you’re miserable in your current situation, chances are it’s because you feel like some part of it is outside your control—that there’s a problem you have no ability to solve, a problem that was somehow thrust upon you without your choosing. When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.

15. part of living in a democracy and a free society is that we all have to deal with views and people we don’t necessarily like. That’s simply the price we pay—you could even say it’s the whole point of the system. And it seems more and more people are forgetting that.
   - Location: 1357-1359
   - Page: 89

16. Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth. As the old adage goes, the man who believes he knows everything learns nothing. We cannot learn anything without first not knowing something. The more we admit we do not know, the more opportunities we gain to learn.
   - Location: 1627-1629
   - Page: 107

17. Action → Inspiration → Motivation If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life, do something—anything, really—and then harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself. I call this the “do something” principle.

## The Secret Wisdom of Nature
**Author:** Peter Wohlleben

### Highlights (4)

1. As erstwhile plains dwellers, our most important sense is sight, and our species relies on viewing things clearly.
   - Location: 62-63
   - Page: 5

2. The earth’s ecosystems, it seems, are a bit too complex for us to compartmentalize them and draw up simple rules of cause and effect. Even conservation measures can have unexpected results. Who knew, for example, that recovering crane populations in Europe would affect the production of Iberian ham?
   - Location: 70-72
   - Page: 5

3. There is, of course, just one relevant source of natural light at night: the moon. When it shines, animals use it to orient themselves. It serves as a kind of compass. When moths fly at night and want to fly in a straight line, they are careful to keep the celestial body at a set angle to their flight path. That works wonderfully well—until an artificial light crosses the tiny flier’s path. The insect assumes this light must be the moon. Confused, it tries to fly so that the moon is always on the correct side—for example, to its left. With the moon, that’s not a problem because it’s almost infinitely far away. With the light, which is close by, the insect quickly flies past. The source of the light is now behind it. It keeps correcting course, and its course corrections lead it to fly in an ever-diminishing circle. Eventually, the moth crashes right into the light itself. It keeps starting again to try to get away—and every new attempt at escape ends in failure.

4. Today, researchers believe that 1.5 to 4 percent of the genetic heritage of most people of European and Asian ancestry comes, somehow, from Neanderthals.2 Our extinct relatives greet us through the skin and eye color of many of our contemporaries. A light complexion and blue irises—current scientific opinion holds that these are Neanderthal adaptations to their northern habitat. Here, the sun is less intense, so an inbuilt sun protection isn’t necessary. When Homo sapiens arriving from Africa had sex with their northern neighbors, they permanently passed these features on to their offspring. Other characteristics from these dalliances are still active today, including the tendency toward depression and addiction to tobacco products.

## This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor
**Author:** Adam Kay

### Highlights (3)

1. I notice that every patient on the ward has a pulse of 60 recorded in their observation chart so I surreptitiously inspect the healthcare assistant’s measurement technique. He feels the patient’s pulse, looks at his watch and meticulously counts the number of seconds per minute.
   - Location: 137-139

2. Our computer system has been upgraded and, as happens eleven times out of ten when the hospital tries to make life easier, they’ve made everything much more complicated. It certainly looks much whizzier (and less like an MS-DOS program from school), but they’ve not actually fixed any of the massive clunking problems with the software, they’ve just slapped an interface on top of it. It’s the equivalent of treating skin cancer by putting make-up over the lesion. Actually, it’s worse than that. This glossy interface uses so much of the exhausted system’s resources that it’s now slowed to a nearly unusable crawl. It’s like treating skin cancer with some make-up that the patient has an extreme allergic reaction to.

   - Page: 44

3. * A lot of individuals (I’m not calling them patients; there’s nothing wrong with them) come to hospital under the misapprehension they’re in any way ill – known as the worried well. If this is because of something they’ve read online, they’re called cyberchondriacs.

## The Science of Storytelling: Why Stories Make Us Human, and How to Tell Them Better
**Author:** Will Storr

### Highlights (19)

1. Human eyes are able to read less than one ten-trillionth of the light spectrum. ‘Evolution shaped us with perceptions that allow us to survive,’ the cognitive scientist Professor Donald Hoffman has said. ‘But part of that involves hiding from us the stuff we don’t need to know. And that’s pretty much all of reality, whatever reality might be.’
   - Location: 361-364
   - Page: 24

2. There’s no colour out there either. Atoms are colourless. All the colours we do ‘see’ are a blend of three cones that sit in the eye: red, green and blue. This makes us Homo sapiens relatively impoverished members of the animal kingdom: some birds have six cones; mantis shrimp have sixteen; bees’ eyes are able to see the electromagnetic structure of the sky. The colourful worlds they experience beggar human imagination. Even the colours we do ‘see’ are mediated by culture. Russians are raised to see two types of blue and, as a result, see eight-striped rainbows.
   - Location: 368-373
   - Page: 24

3. Leo Tolstoy’s brilliant assertion that ‘a real work of art destroys, in the consciousness of the receiver, the separation between himself and the artist.’
   - Location: 394-395
   - Page: 26

4. According to Bergen, we start modelling words as soon as we start reading them. We don’t wait until we get to the end of the sentence. This means the order in which writers place their words matters. This is perhaps why transitive construction – Jane gave a Kitten to her Dad – is more effective than the ditransitive – Jane gave her Dad a kitten. Picturing Jane, then the Kitten, then her Dad mimics the real-world action that we, as readers, should be modelling. It means we’re mentally experiencing the scene in the correct sequence. Because writers are, in effect, generating neural movies in the minds of their readers, they should privilege word order that’s filmic, imagining how their reader’s neural camera will alight upon each component of a sentence. For the same reason, active sentence construction – Jane kissed her Dad – is more effective than passive – Dad was kissed by Jane. Witnessing this in real life, Jane’s initial movement would draw our attention and then we’d watch the kiss play out. We wouldn’t be dumbly staring at Dad, waiting for something to happen.

   - Page: 27

5. The hallucinated world our brain creates for us is specialised. It’s honed towards our particular survival needs. Like all animals, our species can only detect the narrow band of reality that’s necessary for us to get by. Dogs live principally in a world of smell, moles in touch and knife-fish in a realm of electricity. The human world is predominantly that of people. Our hyper-social brains are designed to control an environment of other selves.
   - Location: 463-466
   - Page: 31

6. But much as humans excel at such feats of theory of mind, we also tend to dramatically overestimate our abilities. Although there’s an admitted absurdity in claiming to be able to quantify human behaviour with such absolute numerical precision, some research suggests strangers read another’s thoughts and feelings with an accuracy of just 20 per cent. Friends and lovers? A mere 35 per cent. Our errors about what others are thinking are a major cause of human drama. As we move through life, wrongly predicting what people are thinking and how they’ll react when we try to control them, we haplessly trigger feuds and fights and misunderstandings that fire devastating spirals of unexpected change into our social worlds.
   - Location: 523-528
   - Page: 35

7. There’s a park bench, in my hometown, that I don’t like to walk past because it’s haunted by a breakup with my first love. I see ghosts on that bench that are invisible to anyone else except, perhaps, her. And I feel them too. Just as human worlds are haunted with minds and faces, they’re haunted with memories. We think of the act of ‘seeing’ as the simple detection of colour, movement and shape. But we see with our pasts.
   - Location: 565-568
   - Page: 37

8. Neuroscientists are building a powerful case that metaphor is far more important to human cognition than has ever been imagined. Many argue it’s the fundamental way that brains understand abstract concepts, such as love, joy, society and economy. It’s simply not possible to comprehend these ideas in any useful sense, then, without attaching them to concepts that have physical properties: things that bloom and warm and stretch and shrink.
   - Location: 609-612
   - Page: 40

9. Brain scans illustrate the second, more powerful, use of metaphor. When participants in one study read the words ‘he had a rough day’, their neural regions involved in feeling textures became more activated, compared with those who read ‘he had a bad day’. In another, those who read ‘she shouldered the burden’ had neural regions associated with bodily movement activated more than when they read ‘she carried the burden’. This is prose writing that deploys the weapons of poetry. It works because it activates extra neural models that give the language additional meaning and sensation. We feel the heft and strain of the shouldering, we touch the abrasiveness of the day.
   - Location: 620-625
   - Page: 41

10. Turning the confusing and random into a comprehensible story is an essential function of the storytelling brain. We’re surrounded by a tumult of often chaotic information. In order to help us feel in control, brains radically simplify the world with narrative. Estimates vary, but it’s believed the brain processes around 11 million bits of information at any given moment, but makes us consciously aware of no more than forty. The brain sorts through an abundance of information and decides what salient information to include in its stream of consciousness.
   - Location: 665-669
   - Page: 44

11. When deciding whether to believe something or not, we don’t usually make an even-handed search for evidence. Instead, we hunt for any reason to confirm what our models have instantaneously decided for us. As soon as we find any half-decent evidence to back up our ‘hunch’ we think, ‘Yep, that makes sense.’ And then we stop thinking. This is sometimes known as the ‘makes sense stopping rule’. Not only do our neural-reward systems spike pleasurably when we deceive ourselves like this, we kid ourselves that this one-sided hunt for confirmatory information was noble and thorough.
   - Location: 1093-1098
   - Page: 72

12. Smart people are mostly better at finding ways to ‘prove’ they’re right and tend to be no better at detecting their wrongness.
   - Location: 1101-1102
   - Page: 72

13. The hero-maker delusion is implicated in more misery, fury and death than is possible to calculate. Mao and Stalin and Pol Pot believed they were right, as did Hitler, whose last words before shooting himself were, ‘The world will be eternally grateful to National Socialism that I have extinguished the Jews in Germany and Central Europe.’
   - Location: 1220-1222
   - Page: 80

14. Researchers have found that violence and cruelty has four general causes: greed and ambition; sadism; high self-esteem and moral idealism. Popular belief and clichéd stories tend to have it that greed and sadism are dominant. In fact, they’re vanishingly small. It’s actually high self-esteem and moral idealism – convictions of personal and moral superiority – that drive most acts of evil.
   - Location: 1227-1230
   - Page: 81

15. Moral outrage isn’t the only primal social emotion that’s responsible for the pleasure of storytelling. Evolutionary psychologists argue we have two wired-in ambitions: to get along with people, so they like us and consider us non-selfish members of the tribe, and also get ahead of them, so we’re on top. Humans are driven to connect and dominate. These drives, of course, are frequently incompatible. Wanting to get along and get ahead of them sounds like a recipe for dishonesty, hypocrisy, betrayal and Machiavellian manoeuvring. It’s the conflict at the heart of the human condition and the stories we tell about it.
   - Location: 1791-1795
   - Page: 117

16. Psychologists define humiliation as the removal of any ability to claim status. Severe humiliation has been described as ‘an annihilation of the self’. It’s thought to be a uniquely toxic state and is implicated in some of worst behaviours the human animal engages in, from serial murder to honour killings to genocide.
   - Location: 1910-1912
   - Page: 125

17. All of us are being silently controlled by any number of instructional stories at once. A unique quality of humans is that we’ve evolved the ability to think our way into many tribes simultaneously. ‘We all belong to multiple in-groups,’ writes Professor Leonard Mlodinow. ‘As a result our self-identification shifts from situation to situation. At different times the same person might think of herself as a woman, an executive, a Disney employee, a Brazilian or a mother, depending on which is relevant – or which makes her feel good at the time.’ These groups, and their stories of how to behave and gain connection and status, form part of our identity. It’s mostly during adolescence, that period in which we’re composing our ‘grand narrative of self’, that we decide which ‘peer groups’ to join. We seek out people who have similar mental models to us – who have comparable personalities and interests and perceive the world in ways we recognise. Late adolescence sees many choosing a political ideology, left or right – a tribal master-story that fits over our unconscious landscape of feelings and instincts and half-formed suspicions and makes sense of it, suddenly infusing us with a sense of clarity, mission, righteousness and relief. When this happens it can feel as if we’ve encountered revealed truth and our eyes have suddenly been opened. In fact, the opposite has happened. Tribal stories blind us. They allow us to see only half the truth, at best.

18. For Aristotle happiness was not a feeling but a practice. ‘It’s living in a way that fulfils our purpose,’ the classicist Professor Helen Morales said. ‘It’s flourishing. Aristotle was saying, “Stop hoping for happiness tomorrow. Happiness is being engaged in the process.”’ Recent extraordinary evidence that humans are built to live according to Aristotle’s concept of happiness as a practice rather than a goal comes from the field of social genomics. Results from a team led by Professor of medicine Steve Cole suggest health can improve – risk of heart disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders going down; antiviral response going up – when we’re high in eudaemonic happiness. It changes the expression of our genes. Studies elsewhere find that living with a sufficient sense of purpose reduces the risk of depression and strokes and helps addicts recover from addiction.

## Mama's Last Hug: Animal and Human Emotions
**Author:** Frans de Waal

### Highlights (22)

1. the tricky part is that our emotions and our feelings are not the same. We tend to conflate them, but feelings are internal subjective states that, strictly speaking, are known only to those who have them. I know my own feelings, but I don’t know yours, except for what you tell me about them. We communicate about our feelings by language. Emotions, on the other hand, are bodily and mental states— from anger and fear to sexual desire and affection and seeking the upper hand—that drive behavior. Triggered by certain stimuli and accompanied by behavioral changes, emotions are detectable on the outside in facial expression, skin color, vocal timbre, gestures, odor, and so on. Only when the person experiencing these changes becomes aware of them do they become feelings, which are conscious experiences. We show our emotions, but we talk about our feelings.

2. One journalist was so enamored of a male chimpanzee in a sanctuary that when he looked into the ape’s eyes, he questioned his own identity: he felt like he was staring straight into his lost evolutionary past. In his desire to show respect, however, he unintentionally ended up being condescending. Extant apes are not merely time machines to show us our own evolutionary origins! While it is true that we descend from an apelike ancestor, the ancient species that gave rise to us no longer exists. It dwelled the earth about six million years ago, and its descendants went through numerous changes and died out one by one before giving rise to the survivors around today: the chimpanzee, the bonobo, and our own species. Since these three hominids have equally long histories behind them, they are equally “evolved.” So looking at an ape reveals our shared history not only to us but also to the ape looking back at us. If apes are time machines for us, then we are the same for them.

3. oxytocin is involved in all mammals. This ancient neuropeptide is released by the pituitary gland during sex, nursing, and birthing (it is routinely administered in maternity wards to induce labor), but it also serves to foster bonds among adults. People who have just fallen in love have more oxytocin in their blood than do singles, and their high concentration lasts if their relationship lasts. But oxytocin also shields pair-bonds from sexual adventures with outsiders. When married men are given this hormone in a nasal spray, they feel uncomfortable around attractive women and prefer to keep their distance.

4. We have quite a bit of scientific evidence for future orientation in primates, based on how they plan their travels or prepare tools for a task, but we rarely consider foresight connected to life and death. For obvious reasons, we lack experiments on this ability. If we call awareness of one’s own demise a sense of mortality—for the existence of which we have no evidence outside our own species—we may call Lassie’s recognition that Luke won’t return a sense of finality. It differs from the sense of mortality in that it concerns the other rather than the self.
   - Location: 616-620
   - Page: 41

5. I can’t stand TV sitcoms and Hollywood movies featuring monkeys and apes: every time I see a dressed-up simian actor produce one of their silly grins, I cringe. People may think they’re hilarious, but I know their mood is the opposite of happy. It’s hard to get these animals to bare their teeth without scaring them—only punishment and domination can call forth these expressions. Behind the scenes, a trainer is waving his electric cattle prod or leather whip to make clear what will happen if the animals fail to obey. They are terrified! This is why apes in the movies are almost never adult: grown apes are far too strong for human trainers to dominate, and they’re much wilier than any of the large cats. Only younger apes can be intimidated to the point that they will grin on command.

6. seriously doubt that the smile is our species’s “happy” face, as is often stated in books about human emotions. Its background is much richer, with meanings other than cheeriness. Depending on the circumstances, the smile can convey nervousness, a need to please, reassurance to anxious others, a welcoming attitude, submission, amusement, attraction, and so on. Are all these feelings captured by calling them “happy”?
   - Location: 943-946
   - Page: 62

7. That emotions are rooted in the body explains why Western science has taken so long to appreciate them. In the West, we love the mind, while giving short shrift to the body. The mind is noble, while the body drags us down. We say the mind is strong while the flesh is weak, and we associate emotions with illogical and absurd decisions. “Don’t get too emotional!” we warn. Until recently, emotions were mostly ignored as almost beneath human dignity. Emotions often know better than we do what is good for us, even though not everyone is prepared to listen. While Charles Darwin was trying to decide whether to ask his cousin Emma Wedgwood to marry him, he drew up a long list of arguments in favor (“Object to be beloved & played with—better than a dog anyhow”) and against (“Not forced to visit relatives & to bend in every trifle”).4 This way he hoped to arrive at a perfectly rational decision, but I doubt very much that his list swayed him one way or the other. He even forgot the two points in favor of marriage that many of us would put at the top of the list: love and physical attraction. By writing down a firm QED (quod erat demonstrandum) that favored proposing to Emma, Darwin acted as if he had produced some sort of mathematical proof, but obviously his math was illusionary. We always lean one way or another when we have to make an important decision, and it is rarely the head that does the leaning. In the elegant phrasing of the seventeenth-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal: “The heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing.”5 Emotions help us navigate a complex world that we don’t fully comprehend. They are our body’s way of ensuring that we do what is best for us. Moreover, only the body can carry out the required actions. Minds by themselves are useless: they need bodies to engage with the world. Emotions are at the interface of these three—mind, body, and environment. They are also called affects, but since this term has conflicting definitions, I’ll stick with emotions, defined as follows: An emotion is a temporary state brought about by external stimuli relevant to the organism. It is marked by specific changes in body and mind—brain, hormones, muscles, viscera, heart, alertness, etcetera. Which emotion is being triggered can be inferred by the situation in which the organism finds itself as well as from its behavioral changes and expressions. Instead of a one-on-one relation between an emotion and ensuing behavior, emotions combine individual experience with assessment of the environment to prepare the organism for the optimal response.6

8. Emotions have the great advantage over instincts that they don’t dictate specific behavior. Instincts are rigid and reflex-like, which is not how most animals operate. By contrast, emotions focus the mind and prepare the body while leaving room for experience and judgment. They constitute a flexible response system far and away superior to the instincts. Based on millions of years of evolution, the emotions “know” things about the environment that we as individuals don’t always consciously know. This is why the emotions are said to reflect the wisdom of ages.

9. Our faces are much more mobile than we think, which helps us connect with others by mimicking their movements. This has become a problem for people whose faces have been injected with Botox. Their muscle relaxation keeps them from mirroring the faces of others, which robs them of feeling what others feel. Botoxed people may look wonderful, but they have trouble empathizing. And the problem is not just in how they relate to others, but also how others relate to them. Botoxed faces look frozen, missing the stream of micro-expressions employed in daily interactions. Their facial unresponsiveness makes others feel cut off, rejected even.12

10. Human emotional contagion has been tested the way the voles’ was, by measuring stress hormones. Since the average person fears public speaking more than death, subjects in a study were asked to address an audience. Afterward all participants were invited to spit into a cup, which allowed scientists to extract a hormone associated with anxiety. They found that with confident speakers, the audience followed every word, feeling relaxed, but with nervous ones, the speaker’s discomfort rubbed off on the audience. The hormone levels of speakers and audiences converged the way they did between vole mates.

12. Emotion-based reactions have this gigantic advantage over reflex-like behavior: they pass through a filter of experience and learning known as appraisal. I wish early ethologists had thought of this, instead of clinging to the instinct concept, which is now largely outdated. Instincts are knee-jerk reactions, which are pretty useless in an ever-changing world. Emotions are much more adaptable, because they operate like intelligent instincts. They still produce the desired behavioral change, but only after a careful evaluation of the situation. This evaluation may take only a fraction of a second, yet depends on comparing current conditions with past experience,

13. The so-called Easterlin Paradox was named after Richard Easterlin, an American economist who noticed that within every society, rich people tend to be happier than poor ones. So far so good, but Easterlin also found that if an entire society grows richer, its average well-being doesn’t go up. In other words, people in a wealthy nation do not feel any better than those in a poor one. How is this possible if wealth makes us happy? The answer is that it is not wealth per se that enhances well-being but relative wealth. Feelings of happiness depend on how our income stacks up against that of others.

16. Of the plethora of definitions of free will, however, one strikes me as open for further investigation. The American philosopher Harry Frankfurt defined a “person” as someone who doesn’t just follow his desires but is fully aware of them and capable of wishing them to be different. As soon as an individual considers the “desirability of his desires,” he or she may be said to possess free will, Frankfurt asserted.

20. The silence surrounding the emotions was all the more puzzling if we consider leading alternative proposals for the motivation of animal behavior. The prevailing view was that animals had instincts, a series of inborn actions triggered by a particular situation, or preprogrammed simple responses, such as one kind of action adapted to one kind of context. This sounds cumbersome, though, because it could lead only to rigid behavior, which would be a disaster under changing circumstances. Imagine that a male animal, like a machine, was programmed to react to the sight of a female with automatic sexual arousal, courtship, approach, and mounting. Sometimes this might work, but what if the object of attention was fiercely unwilling? What if a jealous dominant male sat nearby? Or imagine a predator coming around the corner at the wrong moment. Clearly, a fully automated response might get our male in trouble. The reason scientists rarely talk about instincts anymore is that they are just too inflexible. Instead, thinking in terms of emotions, we consider that the sight of an attractive mate induces a strong desire together with a careful evaluation of the circumstances. The desire will urge the individual to strive for the best possible outcome. Other emotions do the same, such as when animals deal with predators, seek to protect their young, strive for a better place in the hierarchy, are interested in the same food as others, and so on. All these situations arouse emotions, which generally have the organism’s best interest at heart. But they merely prime body and mind. They don’t dictate any specific course of action. Sometimes freezing is better than fleeing, sometimes sharing food yields more than fighting, and sometimes a sex partner will need to be led to a hidden location before copulation can take place. Emotions allow this flexibility.

22. That robot emotions are a growing field, known as affective computing, suggests that equipping entities with action-oriented internal states is the best way to organize behavior, just as evolution has done for us. It is how we operate, and how most animals operate. We are emotional beings through and through.

## Mind Fixers: Psychiatry's Troubled Search for the Biology of Mental Illness
**Author:** Anne Harrington

### Highlights (13)

1. In 2013 the NIMH’s then-director, Thomas Insel, called the field out in the starkest of terms. Thirty years after the biological psychiatrists declared victory, he noted, all of psychiatry’s diagnostic categories were still based, not on any biological markers of disease, but merely “on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms.” In the rest of medicine, he said scathingly, this would be “equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever.”

2. Germany’s sterilization program, in turn, paved the way in 1939—after Germany went to war—for an originally secret decision not to sterilize but to murder thousands of mentally ill and disabled institutionalized persons. The justification was that such people had no life “worth living,” and as they were “useless eaters,” the rest of society was better off with them dead as well. Between 1939 and 1945, some 200,000 to 275,000 people (estimates vary), including some 8,000 children, are estimated to have been killed under this program, by lethal injection, by deliberate starvation, or (later) in gas chambers.68 The methods of extermination developed for this program—especially the gas chambers—were later utilized for the so-called “Final Solution,” the genocide of more than six million Jews.

5. Psychiatrists did not pursue drugs as therapeutic tools before the 1950s in part because they already used drugs—as managerial tools, to sedate and calm unruly patients. Since the 1920s, most drugs used in this way were barbiturates. Sold under such brand names as Veronal and Luminal, they were not cures but the “quieting hand” (as one ad put it) to soothe agitated patients and/or help them sleep. The patients who took them may have found temporary relief or been easier to handle, but everyone was clear that their underlying illness was not affected. These drugs did not help patients think more clearly or act more rationally.

6. as so much irresponsible noise on the margins. In 1973, however, something happened that was harder to ignore. Science published a provocative article written by the psychologist (with an expertise in law) David L. Rosenhan, “On Being Sane in Insane Places.” The importance of the article lay not just in what it said, but also in where it was published. Science is the flagship journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and one of the world’s most influential scientific journals. Rosenhan opened his paper with the provocative question: “If sanity and insanity exist, how shall we know them?” Alluding to the labeling theories of the sociologists, he suggested that mental illness might not actually exist. Diagnoses of mental illness might just be stigmatizing labels that psychiatrists imposed on patients for various disciplinary ends. “The view has grown,” Rosenhan observed, “that psychological categorization of mental illness is useless at best and downright harmful, misleading, and pejorative at worst. Psychiatric diagnoses, in this view, are in the minds of observers and are not valid summaries of characteristics displayed by the observed.” This view had “grown” in influence, but was it true? Rosenhan explained how he had tested the matter empirically. Eight sane persons, including himself—people with no previous history of mental illness—went to twelve psychiatric hospitals and pretended they were mentally ill. They told the admitting clinicians that they were hearing voices that said such things as “hollow” and “thud.” They reported no other symptoms. The specific symptom they reported was chosen because it had never been reported in the clinical literature before, implying a kind of “existential psychosis.” All eight were given diagnoses of either manic-depressive psychosis or schizophrenia and admitted. The minute they entered the wards, they started behaving normally, but now that they had been diagnosed as mentally ill, all their behaviors were interpreted as symptoms of their presumed disease. These behaviors included taking field notes for the study (documented in their charts as “excessive writing behavior”). All the sane pseudopatients were released within 9 to 52 days, all with a diagnosis of “schizophrenia in remission.” In no instance did any psychiatrist realize that these people were not mentally ill and never had been, even as other patients on the wards appreciated that fact. Rosenhan recorded how fellow patients would say such things as: “You’re not crazy. You’re a journalist or a professor. You’re checking up on the hospital.”

7. Ironically, just as the public was embracing the “serotonin imbalance” theory of depression, researchers were forming a new consensus that all the simplistic “chemical imbalance” theories of depression—whether focused on serotonin or some other neurotransmitter—were deeply flawed and probably outright wrong.

8. Kirsch recruited additional colleagues to undertake a far more comprehensive analysis. This time they used the Freedom of Information Act to compel the FDA to send them the data it had received from pharmaceutical companies seeking approval for the six most widely prescribed antidepressant drugs: Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor, Serzone, and Celexa. Now they had data not just on published trials but on all trials, published and unpublished, that the drugs’ owners had submitted as part of the FDA approval process.54 In 2002 the Kirsch group reported what they had found. First, only 43 percent of the trials had shown that the drugs provided any statistically significant advantage over placebo. Put another way, 57 percent of the trials had failed.55 Second, even in trials where the drugs outperformed the placebo, the placebo effect’s magnitude was even larger than Kirsch and Sapirstein had reported in 1998: “82 percent of the drug response was duplicated by the placebo response.” In other words, a mere “18 percent of the drug response is due to the pharmacological effects of the medication.”56 The difference was significant statistically but probably not clinically significant—that is to say, the difference between taking a drug and taking a placebo would probably have not been readily apparent to a patient or his or her doctor outside an experimental trial setting. By this time, Kirsch’s was not the only study to draw devastating conclusions like these from the FDA archives. In 2000 the psychiatrists Arif Khan and Walter Brown, looking at data on 19,639 depressed patients in clinical trials, found no statistically significant difference for suicide risk between those taking active medication and those merely swallowing a placebo each day. Beyond that, there was only about a 10 percent difference in general symptom reduction between the two groups.

9. All patients in clinical trials are supposed to be suffering from the same disorder. All are diagnosed using rating scales that, since the 1960s, had been the industry standard for creating supposedly homogenous groups of trial participants. But it now turned out that all along, there had been a big problem with using rating scales or DSM checklists: two people could be diagnosed with depression—the “same” disorder—without sharing a single symptom. Small wonder, one might think, that they might not respond to a drug the same way. The problem, though, was that companies had no idea which patients were more likely than others to respond to one drug or another. The rating scales were clearly unable to do the sorting, and the individuals lacked any biomarkers (reliable biological aberrations found in some patients but not in others) that would allow researchers to create useful subtypes.

10. One of the last straws came when the European Medicines Agency told drug companies that, going forward, any new drug proposed for their markets would no longer just have to outperform placebos: it would either have to outperform existing standard of care drugs on the market, or else the company would have to clearly identify subgroups of patients (ideally with a predictive biomarker) who were likely to respond well to it.66 It was all too much. As Steven Hyman, director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at MIT and Harvard, explained in an email to me, after reviewing an earlier version of this manuscript: “When companies were told they had to compare new drugs not only to placebo but to an existing drug known to be efficacious, or have a predictive biomarker to gain approval in Europe—their response was: ‘we don’t know how to do that.’ . . . In essence the EMA called their bluff.”

11. in 2013, the APA released a fifth edition of the DSM—the first fully updated edition since 1994. And then something quite extraordinary happened. The director of the NIMH, Dr. Tom Insel, drew a clear red line between the new edition and the institute’s research activities: “NIMH,” he stated, “will be re-orienting its research away from DSM categories . . . to begin to develop a better system.”72 For years Insel had been critical of the DSM, insisting that the so-called “bible of psychiatry” had “100 percent reliability and 0 percent validity.”73 Now as director of the NIMH, he could do something about his convictions: he could reject this book. “As long as the research community takes the DSM to be a bible, we’ll never make progress,” he told a New York Times journalist. “Biology,” he concluded firmly, “never read that book.”

12. Among the very many people who present to a general practitioner or a psychiatrist with a mental affliction, some are (almost certainly) suffering from a real illness, one that is understandable (in principle) like any other medical complaint. By the same token, others are (almost certainly) not. Mental suffering takes many forms and has many causes, only some of which have roots in disease. The suffering of those who are not really ill in any meaningful medical sense can still be acute.

13. A century ago some of those who suffered mentally but were not really sick received fictive diagnoses from their doctors like “bad nerves” or “neurasthenia.” By the early twentieth century, most of the doctors who treated such patients knew there was nothing literally wrong with their “nerves.” The patients may or may not have known, or they may or may not have cared. They may not have cared, because the labeling process, when it worked well (and sometimes it was used coercively), was a way of acknowledging the gravity of their suffering. It provided a coherent explanation for real symptoms. Regardless of the (doubtful) validity of the diagnostic terms employed, the very act of naming allowed patients to find support and (perhaps) feel relief under a doctor’s care.3 Given the motivations and outcomes, did it matter that virtually everything in play here was likely fictive, save for the suffering and the care? Were these nerve doctors wrong to do what they did?

## Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Nuclear Disaster
**Author:** Adam Higginbotham

### Highlights (3)

1. At 8:16 a.m. on August 6, 1945, a fission weapon containing sixty-four kilograms of uranium detonated 580 meters above the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and Einstein’s equation proved mercilessly accurate. The bomb itself was extremely inefficient: just one kilogram of the uranium underwent fission, and only seven hundred milligrams of mass—the weight of a butterfly—was converted into energy. But it was enough to obliterate an entire city in a fraction of a second. Some seventy-eight thousand people died instantly, or immediately afterward—vaporized, crushed, or incinerated in the firestorm that followed the blast wave. But by the end of the year, another twenty-five thousand men, women, and children would also sicken and die from their exposure to the radiation liberated by the world’s first atom bomb attack.

2. In September, Dr. Angelina Guskova announced that a total of thirty-one men and women were now dead as a direct result of the explosion and fire in Unit Four of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This number would henceforth be regarded as the official death toll of the accident. Anything higher was treated as evidence of bourgeois Western propaganda. The body of pump operator Valery Khodemchuk, killed immediately by the blast or by falling debris, remained buried beneath the wreckage of the reactor hall; his colleague Vladimir Shashenok, who had died as a result of physical trauma and thermal burns a few hours later in the Pripyat hospital, had been laid to rest in the graveyard of a small village near the power station. Since then, twenty-nine more victims—operators, firemen, and security staff—had succumbed to the effects of acute radiation syndrome in the radiology wards of Kiev and the specialized clinic in Moscow. Of the thirteen patients who had been treated with bone marrow transplants by Robert Gale and the Soviet specialists, all but one had died—so many that Guskova would eventually dismiss the technique as useless for managing ARS.

3. The doctors regarded the survival of some of the most badly exposed operators as almost miraculous. One electrical engineer, Andrei Tormozin, had been only 120 meters from the reactor when it exploded, and then spent hours in highly radioactive areas of the machine hall, working to stop feed pumps and extinguish oil fires. He had absorbed what Guskova and the other specialists had always understood to be a mortal dose of gamma and beta radiation: almost 1,000 rem. His body rejected a bone marrow transplant; he contracted blood poisoning and radiation-induced hepatitis and was not expected to live. But at the end of May, his blood counts began to rally, and—for reasons the doctors could never fully explain—he eventually made a complete recovery.

## Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst
**Author:** Robert M. Sapolsky

### Highlights (22)

1. What occurred in the prior second that triggered the behavior? This is the province of the nervous system. What occurred in the prior seconds to minutes that triggered the nervous system to produce that behavior? This is the world of sensory stimuli, much of it sensed unconsciously. What occurred in the prior hours to days to change the sensitivity of the nervous system to such stimuli? Acute actions of hormones. And so on, all the way back to the evolutionary pressures played out over the prior millions of years that started the ball rolling.

   - Page: 21

3. How do we learn that this person wasn’t so scary after all, that different doesn’t necessarily equal frightening? Recall how a subset of BLA neurons respond to the tone only once conditioning has occurred. Another population does the opposite, responding to the tone once it’s no longer signaling shock (logically, the two populations of neurons inhibit each other). Where do these “Ohhh, the tone isn’t scary anymore” neurons get inputs from? The frontal cortex. When we stop fearing something, it isn’t because some amygdaloid neurons have lost their excitability. We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We actively learn that it isn’t anymore.
   - Location: 595-599
   - Page: 39

4. Importantly, some sensory information entering the brain takes a shortcut, bypassing the cortex and going directly to the amygdala. Thus the amygdala can be informed about something scary before the cortex has a clue. Moreover, thanks to the extreme excitability of this pathway, the amygdala can respond to stimuli that are too fleeting or faint for the cortex to note.

7. What does the frontal cortex do? Its list of expertise includes working memory, executive function (organizing knowledge strategically, and then initiating an action based on an executive decision), gratification postponement, long-term planning, regulation of emotions, and reining in impulsivity.35 This is a sprawling portfolio. I will group these varied functions under a single definition, pertinent to every page of this book: the frontal cortex makes you do the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.
   - Location: 706-711
   - Page: 47

8. In the very front is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the newest part of the frontal cortex. As noted, the frontal cortex is central to executive function. To quote George W. Bush, within the frontal cortex, it’s the PFC that is “the decider.” Most broadly, the PFC chooses between conflicting options—Coke or Pepsi; blurting out what you really think or restraining yourself; pulling the trigger or not. And often the conflict being resolved is between a decision heavily driven by cognition and one driven by emotions. Once it has decided, the PFC sends orders via projections to the rest of the frontal cortex, sitting just behind it. Those neurons then talk to the “premotor cortex,” sitting just behind it, which then passes it to the “motor cortex,” which talks to your muscles. And a behavior ensues.
   - Location: 731-737
   - Page: 48

9. So the frontal cortex is awash in Calvinist self-discipline, a superego with its nose to the grindstone.48 But as an important qualifier, soon after we’re potty-trained, doing the harder thing with our bladder muscles becomes automatic. Likewise with other initially demanding frontal tasks. For example, you’re learning a piece of music on the piano, there’s a difficult trill, and each time as you approach it, you think, “Here it comes. Remember, tuck my elbow in, lead with my thumb.” A classic working-memory task. And then one day you realize that you’re five measures past the trill, it went fine, and you didn’t have to think about it. And that’s when doing the trill is transferred from the frontal cortex to more reflexive brain regions (e.g., the cerebellum). This transition to automaticity also happens when you get good at a sport, when metaphorically your body knows what to do without your thinking about it. The chapter on morality considers automaticity in a more important realm. Is resisting lying a demanding task for your frontal cortex, or is it effortless habit? As we’ll see, honesty often comes more easily thanks to automaticity. This helps explain the answer typically given after someone has been profoundly brave. “What were you thinking when you dove into the river to save that drowning child?” “I wasn’t thinking—before I knew it, I had jumped in.” Often the neurobiology of automaticity mediates doing the hardest moral acts, while the neurobiology of the frontal cortex mediates working hard on a term paper about the subject.

10. without the dlPFC, the metaphorical superego is gone, resulting in individuals who are now hyperaggressive, hypersexual ids. But without a vmPFC, behavior is inappropriate in a detached way. This is the person who, encountering someone after a long time, says, “Hello, I see you’ve put on some weight.” And when castigated later by their mortified spouse, they will say with calm puzzlement, “But it’s true.”

11. Activation of the dlPFC and vmPFC can be inversely correlated. In an inspired study where a keyboard was provided to jazz pianists inside a brain scanner, the vmPFC became more active and the dlPFC less so when subjects improvised. In another study, subjects judged hypothetical harmful acts. Pondering perpetrators’ responsibility activated the dlPFC; deciding the amount of punishment activated the vmPFC.

12. In landmark studies Joshua Greene of Harvard and Princeton’s Cohen showed how the “emotional” and “cognitive” parts of the brain can somewhat dissociate.66 They used philosophy’s famous “runaway trolley” problem, where a trolley is bearing down on five people and you must decide if it’s okay to kill one person to save the five. Framing of the problem is key. In one version you pull a lever, diverting the trolley onto a side track. This saves the five, but the trolley kills someone who happened to be on this other track; 70 to 90 percent of people say they would do this. In the second scenario you push the person in front of the trolley with your own hands. This stops the trolley, but the person is killed; 70 to 90 percent say no way. The same numerical trade-off, but utterly different decisions. Greene and Cohen gave subjects the two versions while neuroimaging them. Contemplating intentionally killing someone with your own hands activates the decider dlPFC, along with emotion-related regions that respond to aversive stimuli (including a cortical region activated by emotionally laden words), the amygdala, and the vmPFC. The more amygdaloid activation and the more negative emotions the participant reported in deciding, the less likely they were to push. And when people contemplate detachedly pulling a lever that inadvertently kills someone? The dlPFC alone activates. As purely cerebral a decision as choosing which wrench to use to fix a widget.

16. over the course of seconds sensory cues can shape your behavior unconsciously. A hugely unsettling sensory cue concerns race.7 Our brains are incredibly attuned to skin color. Flash a face for less than a tenth of a second (one hundred milliseconds), so short a time that people aren’t even sure they’ve seen something. Have them guess the race of the pictured face, and there’s a better-than-even chance of accuracy. We may claim to judge someone by the content of their character rather than by the color of their skin. But our brains sure as hell note the color, real fast. By one hundred milliseconds, brain function already differs in two depressing ways, depending on the race of the face (as shown with neuroimaging). First, in a widely replicated finding, the amygdala activates. Moreover, the more racist someone is in an implicit test of race bias (stay tuned), the more activation there is.8 Similarly, repeatedly show subjects a picture of a face accompanied by a shock; soon, seeing the face alone activates the amygdala.9 As shown by Elizabeth Phelps of NYU, such “fear conditioning” occurs faster for other-race than same-race faces. Amygdalae are prepared to learn to associate something bad with Them. Moreover, people judge neutral other-race faces as angrier than neutral same-race faces. So if whites see a black face shown at a subliminal speed, the amygdala activates.10 But if the face is shown long enough for conscious processing, the anterior cingulate and the “cognitive” dlPFC then activate and inhibit the amygdala. It’s the frontal cortex exerting executive control over the deeper, darker amygdaloid response.

17. The underlying neurobiology concerns “event-related potentials” (ERPs), which are stimulus-induced changes in electrical activity of the brain (as assessed by EEG—electroencephalography). Threatening faces produce a distinctive change (called the P200 component) in the ERP waveform in under two hundred milliseconds. Among white subjects, viewing someone black evokes a stronger P200 waveform than viewing someone white, regardless of whether the person is armed. Then, a few milliseconds later, a second, inhibitory waveform (the N200 component) appears, originating from the frontal cortex—“Let’s think a sec about what we’re seeing before we shoot.” Viewing a black individual evokes less of an N200 waveform than does seeing someone white. The greater the P200/N200 ratio (i.e., the greater the ratio of I’m-feeling-threatened to Hold-on-a-sec), the greater the likelihood of shooting an unarmed black individual. In another study subjects had to identify fragmented pictures of objects. Priming white subjects with subliminal views of black (but not white) faces made them better at detecting pictures of weapons (but not cameras or books).14 Finally, for the same criminal conviction, the more stereotypically African a black individual’s facial features, the longer the sentence.15 In contrast, juries view black (but not white) male defendants more favorably if they’re wearing big, clunky glasses; some defense attorneys even exploit this “nerd defense” by accessorizing their clients with fake glasses, and prosecuting attorneys ask whether those dorky glasses are real. In other words, when blind, impartial justice is supposedly being administered, jurors are unconsciously biased by racial stereotypes of someone’s face.

18. Other types of subliminal visual information influence the brain.17 For example, the gender of a face is processed within 150 milliseconds. Ditto with social status. Social dominance looks the same across cultures—direct gaze, open posture (e.g., leaning back with arms behind the head), while subordination is signaled with averted gaze, arms sheltering the torso. After a mere 40-millisecond exposure, subjects accurately distinguish high- from low-status presentations. As we’ll see in chapter 12, when people are figuring out stable status relations, logical areas of the frontal cortex (the vmPFC and dlPFC) activate; but in the case of unstable, flip-flopping relations, the amygdala also activates. It’s unsettling when we’re unsure who gets ulcers and who gives them. There’s also subliminal cuing about beauty.18 From an early age, in both sexes and across cultures, attractive people are judged to be smarter, kinder, and more honest. We’re more likely to vote for attractive people or hire them, less likely to convict them of crimes, and, if they are convicted, more likely to dole out shorter sentences. Remarkably, the medial orbitofrontal cortex assesses both the beauty of a face and the goodness of a behavior, and its level of activity during one of those tasks predicts the level during the other.

19. Testosterone has far less to do with aggression than most assume. Within the normal range, individual differences in testosterone levels don’t predict who will be aggressive. Moreover, the more an organism has been aggressive, the less testosterone is needed for future aggression. When testosterone does play a role, it’s facilitatory—testosterone does not “invent” aggression. It makes us more sensitive to triggers of aggression, particularly in those most prone to aggression. Also, rising testosterone levels foster aggression only during challenges to status. Finally, crucially, the rise in testosterone during a status challenge does not necessarily increase aggression; it increases whatever is needed to maintain status. In a world in which status is awarded for the best of our behaviors, testosterone would be the most prosocial hormone in existence.

20. Oxytocin and vasopressin facilitate mother-infant bond formation and monogamous pair-bonding, decrease anxiety and stress, enhance trust and social affiliation, and make people more cooperative and generous. But this comes with a huge caveat—these hormones increase prosociality only toward an Us. When dealing with Thems, they make us more ethnocentric and xenophobic. Oxytocin is not a universal luv hormone. It’s a parochial one.
   - Location: 2116-2118

21. Sustained stress has numerous adverse effects. The amygdala becomes overactive and more coupled to pathways of habitual behavior; it is easier to learn fear and harder to unlearn it. We process emotionally salient information more rapidly and automatically, but with less accuracy. Frontal function—working memory, impulse control, executive decision making, risk assessment, and task shifting—is impaired, and the frontal cortex has less control over the amygdala. And we become less empathic and prosocial. Reducing sustained stress is a win-win for us and those stuck around us.

22. Over the course of minutes to hours, hormonal effects are predominantly contingent and facilitative. Hormones don’t determine, command, cause, or invent behaviors. Instead they make us more sensitive to the social triggers of emotionally laden behaviors and exaggerate our preexisting tendencies in those domains.

## The Mind Is Flat: The Illusion of Mental Depth and the Improvised Mind
**Author:** Nick Chater

### Highlights (11)

1. We generate our beliefs, values and actions in-the-moment; they are not pre-calculated and ‘written’ in some unimaginably vast memory store just in case they might be needed. And this implies that there is no pre-existing ‘inner world of thought’ from which our thoughts issue. Thoughts, like fiction, come into existence in the instant that they are invented, and not a moment before. The very idea of ‘looking’ into our own minds embodies the mistake: we talk as if we have a faculty of introspection, to scrutinize the contents of our inner world, just as we have faculties of perception, to inform us about the external world.2 But introspection is a process not of perception but of invention: the real-time generation of interpretations and explanations to make sense of our own words and actions. The inner world is a mirage.

2. Increasingly, researchers are finding that the best way to make computers display intelligent behaviour is not to attempt to extract the knowledge and beliefs that people say they rely on; it is far more effective to create intelligent behaviour by designing machines that can learn from experience.
   - Location: 294-296
   - Page: 20

3. to emulate human intelligence, the starting strategy is: Step 1. To excavate our mental depths, and to bring to the surface as much of this supposed inner storehouse of beliefs as we can. Step 2. To organize and systematize this knowledge to recover our hidden ‘common-sense theory’. To encode this knowledge in a computer database involves expressing it in a tidy and precise formal language that the computer can work with, rather than merely noting it down in ‘plain English’. Step 3. To devise computational methods to reason over this database, in order to use this common-sense knowledge to make sense of new experiences, use language, solve problems, make choices, plans and conversation, and generally to engage in intelligent behaviour. Early attempts to create artificially intelligent computer programs to replicate human intelligence took precisely this approach. There were plenty of sceptical philosophers and psychologists who felt that this method was doomed from the outset – people who suspected, in our terms, that mental depth might be an illusion. But the researchers were undeterred. If there was a chance that the approach might succeed, it was surely well worth attempting – the achievement of creating genuinely intelligent machines by capturing and recreating our own understanding of the world would be so spectacular. And hopes were high. Over successive decades, leading researchers forecast that human-level intelligence would be achieved within twenty to thirty years. Yet progress seemed slower, and the challenges far greater, than had been imagined. By the 1970s, serious doubts began to set in; by the 1980s, the programme of mining and systematizing knowledge started to grind to a halt. Indeed, the project of modelling human intelligence has since been quietly abandoned, in favour of specialist projects in computer vision, speech-processing, machine translation, game-playing, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Artificial intelligence since the 1980s has been astonishingly successful in tackling these specialized problems. This success has come, though, from completely bypassing the extraction of human knowledge into common-sense theories. Instead, over recent decades, AI researchers have made advances by building machines that learn not from people but from direct confrontation with the problem to be solved: much of AI has mutated into a distinct but related field: machine-learning. Machine-learning works by extracting information not from people, but from huge quantities of data: images, speech waves, linguistic corpora, chess games, and so on. And this has been possible because of advances on a number of fronts: computers have become faster, data sets larger and learning methods cleverer. But at no stage have human beliefs been mined or common-sense theories reconstructed.

4. The project of creating artificial intelligence by extracting, systematizing and reasoning with human thoughts – trying to coax out the ‘theories’ of our inner oracle – failed in a particularly instructive way. The very first step, drawing out the knowledge, beliefs, motives, and so on, that underpinned people’s behaviour, turned out to be hopelessly difficult. People can fluently generate verbal explanations and justifications of their thoughts and actions; and, whenever parts of those explanations are queried, out will tumble further verbal explanation or justification. But analysis of these streams of verbal description, however long they continue, shows that they are little more than a series of loosely connected fragments. Chess grandmasters, it turns out, can’t really explain how they play chess; doctors can’t explain how they diagnose patients; and none of us can remotely explain how we understand the everyday world of people and objects.

8. The sensitivity of colour vision falls very rapidly, though smoothly, as we move out from the fovea (the dense pit of specialized colour-detecting ‘cone cells’ in the retina which your eye ‘points’ at any item of interest; see Figure 2). Indeed, outside a few degrees of where you are directly looking, you are close to being completely colour blind. The ‘rod’ cells that dominate most of your visual field can only detect dark and light. So the basic anatomy of the eye tells us that, except for within a few degrees of where we are directing our eyes, we are seeing in black and white. Yet, of course, we have the feeling that our entire ‘subjective visual world’ is richly coloured. This, at least, must be an illusion.

9. We ‘see’ only meaningful organizations (or at least the most meaningful organization the brain can find): visual chunks, patterns and whole letters, numbers, words, rather than a random scatter of fragments. We see just one meaningful organization at a time (we can see, for example, BEER or PEEP, but we cannot have the experience of seeing both). Other sensory information that is not part of this meaningful organization (though clearly and distinctly projected onto the retina at all times), is largely or even entirely ignored, to the point of becoming entirely invisible. The brain is continually churning: despite the unaccustomed lack of new input, the brain is desperately attempting to disengage from the current organization, and to find another. When it cannot, the image entirely disappears.

But it is clearly a hopeless strategy to look for the meaning of the word by closely scrutinizing the word itself.

2. intermittent positive reinforcement. Scientists have known since Michael Zeiler’s famous pecking pigeon experiments from the 1970s that rewards delivered unpredictably are far more enticing than those delivered with a known pattern. Something about unpredictability releases more dopamine—a key neurotransmitter for regulating our sense of craving. The original Zeiler experiment had pigeons pecking a button that unpredictably released a food pellet. As Adam Alter points out, this same basic behavior is replicated in the feedback buttons that have accompanied most social media posts since Facebook introduced the “Like” icon in 2009. “It’s hard to exaggerate how much the ‘like’ button changed the psychology of Facebook use,” Alter writes. “What had begun as a passive way to track your friends’ lives was now deeply interactive, and with exactly the sort of unpredictable feedback that motivated Zeiler’s pigeons.” Alter goes on to describe users as “gambling” every time they post something on a social media platform: Will you get likes (or hearts or retweets), or will it languish with no feedback? The former creates what one Facebook engineer calls “bright dings of pseudo-pleasure,” while the latter feels bad. Either way, the outcome is hard to predict, which, as the psychology of addiction teaches us, makes the whole activity of posting and checking maddeningly appealing.

## The Gendered Brain: The New Neuroscience That Shatters the Myth of the Female Brain
**Author:** Gina Rippon

### Highlights (28)

1. The message at the heart of this book is that a gendered world will produce a gendered brain. I believe that understanding how this happens and what it means for brains and their owners is important, not just for women and girls, but for men and boys, parents and teachers, businesses and universities, and for society as a whole.
   - Location: 169-171

2. The term ‘sex’ was commonly used to refer to both biological and social characteristics of women and men. Towards the end of the twentieth century, in the light of feminist concerns, there was a move to challenge this deterministic approach. There was an emerging insistence that the term ‘gender’ be used when referring to matters that were solely to do with social matters, distinct from ‘sex’, which should be reserved for any reference to biology. Fast-forward a few years and, as we shall see, it became clear that it was getting harder and harder to sustain this neat distinction between sex and gender. Our emerging understanding of how much the brain can be influenced by social pressures meant that we needed a term to reflect this entanglement; in academic circles, the use of ‘sex/gender’ or ‘gender/sex’ has been offered as a solution. But this is not widespread in everyday usage and is rarely to be found in the popular media or in more populist articles about females and males. The solution there seems to be to use ‘sex’ or ‘gender’ pretty interchangeably, with perhaps a greater tendency to use ‘gender’ to avoid the impression that you believe whatever you are talking about is actually all down to biology. You never see articles on ‘sex pay gaps’ or ‘sex imbalances’, for example, in business leadership. But when it comes down to it, it is clear that the term ‘gender’ now bundles together all aspects of females and males in just the same way that ‘sex’ used to.

3. Given that many of the arguments are about the core role of biology, I shall use the term ‘sex’ or ‘sex differences’ as the default option when talking about the brain or about individuals clearly being divided according to whether they are biologically female or male. ‘Gender differences’ will mainly be reserved for when we are looking at socialisation issues such as, for example, the pink and blue tsunami which washes over newly arrived humans. The title The Gendered Brain aims to acknowledge that we are looking at the brain-changing effects of social processes.

4. It has been estimated that eighty per cent of the women in the United States experience premenstrual emotional or physical symptoms.14 PMS has a well-established place in popular culture, where we find a general consensus about premenstrual frenzy and hormonal roller-coasters, with out-of-control women suffering weeks of hell.15 Interestingly, World Health Organization surveys suggest that there are cultural variations in the kinds of complaint that are associated with the premenstrual phase. The emotional changes reported above are almost exclusively found in western Europe, Australia and North America, whereas women in Eastern cultures such as China are more likely to note physical symptoms such as water retention but rarely mention emotional problems.

5. Psychology’s involvement with the story of the sex differences hunt comprises two key contributions. The first is linked to the emergence of the theory of evolution, emphasising our adaptability as the basis for our past and continued success. At heart a theory about individual differences in biological characteristics, evolution quickly extended its range to explanations not only of different individual skills but also of the functions of different social roles, as determined by differences in biology. The line was that sex differences were there for a purpose, and it was the role of evolutionary theorists to explain that purpose. The second is the role of the emerging discipline of experimental psychology with its emphasis on numerical data. Rightly uneasy about the rather anecdotal nature of early case studies and clinical observations, a psychometric ‘industry’ emerged, developing elaborate tests and questionnaires to generate numerical scores to attach not only to measures of ability but also to rather more amorphous concepts such as ‘masculinity and femininity’. The numbers game offered a sheen of objectivity to the go-to list of sex differences that were being generated.

6. Wilhelm Wundt had founded the first psychology lab in 1879.25 He was keen to apply the scientific method to behaviour, to generate standard measures of the behaviours we could see, such as reaction time or error rate or amount of recall in memory tasks, or the number of particular words (such as words beginning with ‘s’, or names for fruits) that might be spontaneously generated. There was to be no more introspection, personal opinion or anecdote sharing – this was about data. Psychologists would utilise any kind of task that could produce a score of some kind, turning them into tests which produced an external measurement that appeared to have some relationship to the behaviour of interest. Early studies focussed on finding different ways of measuring the skills that the psychologists were interested in, but an interest in individual differences soon emerged. This was partly driven by changes in the educational system, which meant schools wanted ways of identifying ‘slow’ children, those who we would today identify as having special educational needs. As we know, this was the origin of the IQ test.26 Tests of cognitive skills were then followed by tests of personality or temperament. The first one, Woodworth’s Personal Data Sheet, was developed in 1917 and its aim was to identify soldiers in the First World War who might end up suffering from shell shock.27 This kind of test was still quite objective and fact-based, and included questions such as ‘Has any of your family committed suicide?’ or ‘Have you ever fainted away?’ (these having been identified as discriminatory factors by looking at past case histories) but soon various types of self-report inventories were being developed, where people were asked to indicate the extent to which certain adjectives (‘well-organised’, for example) described them, or certain phrases characterised their behaviour (‘I can relax and enjoy myself at gay parties’ – though this wording has been changed in more recent test revisions!).

7. One way of calculating the degree of overlap between two groups is by measuring what is called the effect size.34 To calculate this you subtract the average or mean score of one group from the average score of the other and divide the answer by the amount of variability in the two groups.
   - Location: 1107-1109
   - Page: 73

8. The key issue is that effect size tells you how meaningful group differences are. Psychologists report their statistical findings as showing ‘significant differences’, which strictly speaking they do, but the differences may be tiny and really unlikely to have much impact on, say, a decision to employ someone from one of the groups as opposed to the other (or whether you want to ask a coffee drinker or a tea drinker to help you solve a crossword puzzle). When you are talking about something with as much impact as findings about sex differences, then it is important to signal clearly what you mean. If effect sizes are small (about 0.2) the differences between the scores of your groups might be statistically ‘significant’ but, really, not very supportive of any assumptions you might have about how easily you can spot who belongs to which group, or what the members of that group can or can’t do.
   - Location: 1112-1119
   - Page: 73

9. If two groups are markedly different, then the effect size will be quite large. The most common example is height differences between men and women. The average effect size here is about 2.0, so the means are quite different and about ninety-eight per cent of the taller group will be above the average height for the smaller group.35 Even with an effect size this big, however, the two populations still overlap by just over thirty per cent. The reason I’m rather labouring this point is that the effect sizes in much of the published sex differences research are actually quite small, of the order of 0.2 or 0.3, which means an overlap of nearly ninety per cent. Even a ‘moderate’ effect size, 0.5, means an overlap of just over eighty per cent. So when people refer to sex differences, we need to be aware that this almost never means that the two groups are non-overlapping, clearly distinguishable by whatever variable you are measuring, and that knowing someone’s sex will not be a reliable predictor of how well or badly they are going to do on a specific task or in a specific situation.

10. There is one more note of caution to sound about the reporting of research findings. If someone tells you that something is ‘significant’, for example that men and women are ‘significantly’ different, you probably assume that this means that this difference is important, should make you sit up and take notice. You probably don’t think, ‘Aha, that means there is a less than 5 in 100 possibility that this is a chance finding.’ This isn’t to suggest that the research findings aren’t saying something meaningful, just that we might need to temper the ‘wow’ factor that the word ‘significant’ can sometimes imply.

11. Many years ago, I went to a weekend conference on the heritability of IQ. The morning session was run by geneticists, and there were many papers on genome-wide association studies, heritability assessment, the implications of knock-out mice models, gene variation and so forth. All of these used IQ as a dependent variable or modelling factor, with humans assessed via an IQ test which seemed to be the ‘industry standard’. No one made any reference to how this particular variable was measured or, indeed, what exactly it was that was being measured, just how an IQ score or its rodent or monkey equivalent was affected by whatever genetic model or manipulation they were using. Psychologists took over in the afternoon and proceeded to dismantle the faith their geneticist colleagues had in their core measure. Issues with individual items, the heterogeneity of the subtests and different skills being measured, retest reliability, the need to take account of environmental factors such as access to education, socio-economic status in the case of humans, or cage size and handling frequency in the case of non-humans, the very definition of intelligence itself – all served to reveal that IQ was not like, say, eye colour or blood type, a fixed and objectively measurable trait that could be slotted neatly into whatever model was being tested. You needed to know much more of the back story to know what that IQ number was really measuring.

15. In order to track all of this, twenty-first-century brain imagers are using different types of systems and measurements. We know that communication in the brain takes place between nerve cells or neurons. Messages are passed between these cells via 100 trillion (approximately) connections by tiny electro-chemical changes, in millisecond timescales, beautifully orchestrated by the range of checks and balances that have evolved in our brains. For an everyday, non-invasive understanding of how the human brain works, we need to be able to track these real-time changes from outside the head. The EEG approach that was available in the last century offered some early insights, but it is hard to get a ‘clean’ signal when it was being distorted by its passage from within the brain, through brain membranes, the skull, skin and hair. This is where magnetoencephalography (MEG) comes in.8 Basic physics has shown us that wherever an electrical current is flowing, a magnetic field is created. And magnetic fields from the brain aren’t distorted in the same way as electrical currents, so tracking the changes in magnetic fields is a much more accurate way of ‘brain watching’. As ever, this is not quite as easy as it sounds. The magnetic fields associated with brain activity are minute. They are about five billion times weaker than those of a fridge magnet, weaker than the earth’s magnetic field or the kind of magnetic fields you might find in any laboratory. They can be distorted by anything metallic (including the metal in tattooed eyebrows, as I discovered to my chagrin during an open day demonstration). So you have to use exquisitely sensitive sensors known as superconducting quantum interference devices (generating SQUID as a great acronym), which only function at extremely low temperatures – about 270°C below zero. To keep them supercool, the SQUIDs are put in a head-shaped helmet, a bit like an old-fashioned hairdryer, and covered in liquid helium, and the whole shebang has to be housed in a specially built magnetically shielded room to keep other magnetic fields at bay.

16. The discovery of life-long ‘experience-dependent plasticity’ has drawn attention to the crucial role that the outside world – the lives we live, the jobs we do, the sports we play – will have on our brains.23 It’s no longer a question of our brains being a product of either nature or nurture but realising how entangled the ‘nature’ of our brains is with the brain-changing ‘nurture’ provided by our life experiences.

17. The most famous example of plasticity is the well-known London taxi driver studies carried out by UCL neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire and her team.26 Maguire showed that four years of ‘doing the Knowledge’, which requires memorising different routes through the 25,000 or so London streets within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross station, resulted in grey matter increases in the posterior part of the hippocampus, which underpins spatial cognition and memory. This wasn’t because they already had bigger hippocampi (she tracked both learners and retirees and mapped increases in the former and decreases in the latter) or because they were having to navigate complex driving routes (bus drivers with fixed routes didn’t show the same effect). She also looked at trainees who failed the course and found that they did not show the hippocampal changes that characterised their successful colleagues. There appeared to be a cost to this brain-changing expertise; successful taxi drivers were significantly worse on other tests of spatial memory. However, retired taxi drivers, while showing a return to ‘normal’ grey matter volume in their hippocampi (and declines in their previous London-specific navigational skills), also displayed improved levels of performance in ordinary spatial memory. So this group of studies shows both the ebb and flow of brain plasticity, with shifts in the allocation of brain resources coming and going in the context of acquiring, using and losing a particular skill.

18. we now think of the brain as a proactive guidance system, continuously generating predictions as to what might be coming next in our worlds (known in the business as ‘establishing a prior’).31 Our brains monitor the fit between these predictions and the real outcome, passing back error messages so that the prior is updated, and we’re guided safely through the unremitting streams of information with which we are constantly bombarded. The core aim of this system is to minimise ‘prediction error’ by speedily and continuously generating and updating priors based on the normal course of events. These will draw on pretty minimal amounts of information to estimate the next step and ensure no surprises, efficiently reducing the need for cognitively wasteful rechecking or ‘over-thinking’. In the light of feedback about a mismatch, a quick reconstruction of a new prior will follow. So, our brain navigates us through the world via a combination of predictive-texting-like skills and high-end satnav guidance.

19. It is claimed that our brain’s ‘predictive coding’ power is not only applied to the most basic sights and sounds and movements but also allows us to engage with higher-level processes such as language, art, music and humour, as well as the often hidden rules of social engagement, underpinning our ability to predict the actions and intentions of other people and interpret their behaviour accordingly.32 The guidelines we employ are extracted from our outside world, the ‘data in’ side of things, and used to generate rules to determine the next most likely outcome in life’s rich pattern, what behaviours are associated with what facial or verbal expressions, what intention is being flagged up by what action. The rules that are extracted can range from ‘this kind of smell usually results in finding something good to eat’ to ‘that kind of facial expression usually means that someone is happy’ or to even more abstract and hard-to-define rules of social engagement, such as understanding turn taking in conversations.

20. Newly emerging models of mental illness or atypical behaviour are also starting to incorporate this notion of predictive coding. My own current research is focussing on the idea that a fault in this process in autistic brains could underpin many of the difficulties they present. Not being able to make a satisfac-tory prior means that life is full of prediction errors, no rules can be extracted, and the world becomes a confusing, noisy and unpredictable space, to be avoided at all costs or to be tamed by the imposition of rigorous repetitive routines.

21. We are wired to be social. We are driven by deep motivations to stay connected with friends and family. We are naturally curious about what is going on in the minds of other people. And our identities are formed by the values lent to us from the groups we call our own. Matthew D. Lieberman

22. The fact that the pain of social rejection is driven by the same networks that underpin our experience of such pain shows how central the drive to be social is to human behaviour. Being excluded or rated as boring can hurt as much as an electric shock. Our involvement in social networks appears to be such an essential to our survival that we have a ‘social pain’ mechanism, which alerts us to the need to rethink our behaviour, change our plans, just in order to re-engage with our fellow human beings.

23. There are two types of task that experimental psychologists have devised to demonstrate how our brains deal with conflicting information or how we manage to put a stop to what is called a ‘prepotent response’. One is called the Go/NoGo task – you have to press a button as fast as possible when you see one signal, but not press the button when another signal comes up.22 This is harder than you might think. One of the online games my research team play with children involves an intergalactic journey where they have to fire a rocket when they see an alien through a porthole, but must not fire a rocket when they see a spaceman. While developing it we tried it out on our colleagues in the lab. Suffice it to say, we have to hope for the future of the universe that not too many brain imagers are put in charge of any kind of nuclear button! The other tricky game is called the Stroop task.23 If the word ‘green’ is written in green and you are asked to name the colour the word is written in you can do it pretty fast. If, however, the word ‘green’ is written in red, you slow down quite dramatically. This is a measure of an interference effect caused by a mismatch between the different types of information you are processing, or the mixed messages you might be getting from the outside world.

24. Once the baby is born, the dramatic rate of growth continues – initially at about one per cent a day, then gradually ‘slowing’ to about 0.5 per cent a day after the first ninety days, by which time it has more than doubled in size. The rate of growth is not the same over the whole brain; we see faster changes in those areas associated with the more basic structures, such as those that control vision and movement. The biggest change is in the cerebellum, which controls movement, and more than doubles in size over the first three months, as opposed to the hippocampus, a key feature in memory circuits, which only shows a volume change of about fifty per cent (which possibly accounts for why no one remembers learning to walk).

25. Total brain size differences should not be interpreted as imparting any sort of functional advantage or disadvantage. Gross structural measures may not reflect sexually dimorphic differences in functionally relevant factors such as neuronal connectivity and receptor density. This is further highlighted by the remarkable degree of variability seen in overall volumes and shapes of individual trajectories in this carefully selected group of healthy children. Healthy normally functioning children at the same age could have 50 per cent differences in brain volume, highlighting the need to be cautious regarding functional implications of absolute brain sizes.

26. At the outset, human babies don’t appear to be able to do much when they arrive. Different types of animals have different capacities and abilities at birth; some, known as ‘precocial’ animals, emerge relatively ready to become independent, able to stand and suckle within the first few minutes – giraffes are a favourite example. Others, known as ‘altricial’ animals, are quite helpless, possibly blind, deaf and unable to move, and remain dependent on their carers for relatively long periods of time. The length of time human babies are dependent on the care of others puts them firmly in the second group (together with rats, cats and dogs, among others).

27. Eyes are, of course, more than just devices for receiving visual information; they have a social function too. Eye contact, or mutual eye gaze, is often considered a primary indication of social engagement and communication. Newborn infants typically prefer faces which have their eyes open rather than closed and will look longer at faces when the eyes are gazing directly at them as opposed to averted.54 By three months, babies can get quite agitated if their mother looks away from them and will often hand-wave or jiggle up and down to re-engage her attention.

28. Baby scientists If you were asked to rank the various high-level accomplishments of the human race, mathematics and the understanding of the laws of physics would probably come fairly near the top of your list. You might also characterise such feats as achievable only after many years of education and, further, beyond the reach of many, no matter how many opportunities they had been given. So you might be surprised to know that very young babies have already grasped the basic principles of high-level science. Within two days of arrival in the world, they can tell the difference between big numbers and small numbers, matching short bursts of beeps to pictures showing just a few smiley faces, and long bursts of beeps to pictures with lots of smiley faces.13 Two or three months later, they will express surprise if a ball doesn’t roll out of the end of the tube they saw it roll into;14 five months later, they are perturbed when what looks like a liquid in a glass turns out to be solid, as their stripey drinking straw stops on the surface of the pretend water into which it has been dropped.15 So, within five months of making it into the world, babies are already demonstrating a grasp of basic mathematics (or numeracy) and of intuitive physics, of how objects normally behave and what the basic characteristics of substances are. The possession of such ‘core knowledge’, as it is called, is yet another demonstration of how human infants are far from helpless or passive receivers of the world around them, but capable of amazingly sophisticated observations and interactions with that world.

## Wired to Create: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind
**Author:** Scott Barry Kaufman;Carolyn Gregoire

### Highlights (49)

1. Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson said of creativity and life, “The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive.”
   - Location: 226-227

2. The common strands that seemed to transcend all creative fields was an openness to one’s inner life, a preference for complexity and ambiguity, an unusually high tolerance for disorder and disarray, the ability to extract order from chaos, independence, unconventionality, and a willingness to take risks.

3. Creative people not only cultivate a wide array of attributes but are also able to adapt—even flourish—by making the best of the wide range of traits and skills that they already possess. This ability to adapt to changing circumstances with fluidity and flexibility is reflected in three main “super-factors” of personality that are highly correlated with creativity: plasticity, divergence, and convergence.26 Plasticity is characterized by the tendency to explore and engage with novel ideas, objects, and scenarios.27 Characteristics like openness to experience, high energy, and inspiration are all related to each other, forming the core of this drive for exploration. Divergence reflects a nonconformist mind-set and independent thinking and is related to impulsivity and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness. Finally, convergence refers to the ability to conform, put in the hard effort necessary to exercise practicality, and make ideas tenable. Convergence consists of high conscientiousness, precision, persistence, critical sense, and sensitivity to the audience. Individually and together, these diverse qualities encourage the development and expression of creativity. These characteristics come into play during the two broad stages of the creative process: generation—in which ideas are produced and originality is sought out—and selection, which involves working out ideas and making them valuable to society. While characteristics associated with plasticity and divergence are most relevant when generating ideas, convergence is most important during the stage when ideas are being ironed out and made tenable.

4. Creative people seem to be particularly good at operating within a broad spectrum of personality traits and behaviors. They are both introverted and extraverted, depending on the situation and environment, and learn to harness both mindfulness and mind wandering in their creative process.

5. Creative thought doesn’t emerge solely from the imagination network.39 A different brain network—the “executive attention” network, which helps us direct our attention—is also crucial here. Executive control processes support creative thinking by helping us deliberately plan future actions, remember to use various creative tactics, keep track of which strategies we’ve already tried, and reject the most obvious ideas.40 They also help us focus our imagination, blocking out external distractions and allowing us to tune in to our inner experience. The imagination network and the executive attention network cooperate with each other whenever we have to evaluate personal information, from future planning to keeping track of social information, to evaluating a creative idea, to planning and carrying out a project.

6. When we generate new ideas, these networks—along with the salience network, which is responsible for motivation—engage in an intricate dance.
   - Location: 371-372

7. In this book, we’ll discuss creativity as a habit, as a way of life, and as a style of engaging with the world.44 Following in the footsteps of psychologists J. P. Guilford, Frank Barron, E. Paul Torrance, Robert J. Sternberg, and Abraham Maslow, we’ll argue that we are all, in some way, wired to create and that everyday life presents myriad opportunities to exercise and express that creativity. This can take the form of approaching a problem in a new way, seeking out beauty, developing and sticking to our own opinions (even if they’re unpopular), challenging social norms, taking risks, or expressing ourselves through personal style.

8. While creativity—expressions of originality and meaningfulness in daily life—does not require suffering, creative work can be highly therapeutic for those who are experiencing hardship. People who engage in a creative lifestyle—perhaps by drifting off in daydreams, taking photographs just for fun, talking passionately about personal goals, writing thoughtful cards or letters to friends and family, keeping a journal, or starting their own business—tend to be more open minded, imaginative, intellectually curious, energetic, outgoing, persistent, and intrinsically motivated by their activity. They also report a greater sense of well-being and personal growth compared to those who are less engaged in these everyday creative behaviors.

9. For many artists—particularly writers—this crucial “tissue of experience” comes from youth, and the ability to access a deep well of early memories and emotions can facilitate their creative work. Flannery O’Connor famously said that anyone who has survived childhood has as much material about life as they’ll ever need, while John Updike noted, similarly, “Memories, impressions, and emotions from your first 20 years on earth are most writers’ main material:

10. Observing children engaged in imaginative play reveals a wellspring of natural-born creativity; they make up and act out stories, taking on the roles of writer, actor, and director with ease and enjoyment. This occurs naturally, without instruction or guidance, starting at roughly the age of two and a half and lasting until around nine or ten years old, and it can occupy up to 20 percent of a child’s time at its peak.
   - Location: 550-553
   - Page: 36

11. Some studies have found that direct instruction in the earliest years of life can backfire, making children less curious, less likely to discover new information, and less likely to make new, unexpected connections.27 In fact, psychologists in New Zealand found that children who learned to read later in childhood had greater reading comprehension scores, suggesting that it may not always be beneficial to rush children to learn key competencies.28 The evidence is loud and clear: Time for play and curiosity supports learning.

13. While we usually associate inspiration with visual art, it’s also important in other artistic fields and in the scientific world. Patent-holding inventors report being inspired more frequently than nonpatent holders, and the higher the frequency of inspiration, the higher the number of patents they held. Being in a state of inspiration also predicts the creativity of writing samples across scientific writing, poetry, and fiction.

14. The next time you’re working hard on a creative project or work assignment that requires intense focus and creative chops, try taking a five-minute daydreaming break every hour or so, and see how it affects your ideas and thinking. During this break, engage in a simple activity that will allow your mind to wander, like walking, doodling, or cleaning. Consider this your creative incubation period and see if you feel a renewed sense of creative energy when you get back to work.

15. Aristotle, Nietzsche, Freud, Hemingway, Jefferson, Dickens, Beethoven, and many other thinkers made regular strolls a part of their creative process, and Nietzsche went so far as to say that “all truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.” Greek philosopher Diogenes proved the law of motion using the phrase Solvitur ambulando, “It is solved by walking,”32 while Thoreau noted that if we spend time outside, “there will be so much more air and sunshine in our thoughts.”33 Now, scientists are singing a similar refrain. Studies have shown that creative problems, in fact, can be solved by walking, particularly in nature, thanks to physiological changes in the brain that lead to lower frustration and stress, boosted engagement and arousal, and higher levels of meditation and enhanced mood—all of which can help us come up with more creative connections.

16. the act of creating requires us to find time to ourselves and slow down enough to hear our own ideas—both the good and the bad ones. Some degree of isolation is required in order to do creative work, because the artist is constantly working through ideas or projects in his mind—and these ideas need space to be developed. The creative person’s mind is “shuffling his information at all times, even when he is not conscious of it,” Asimov wrote in the essay, first published in 2014. “The presence of others can only inhibit this process, since creation is embarrassing. For every new good idea you have, there are a hundred, ten thousand foolish ones, which you naturally do not care to display.”

17. Solitary, inwardly focused reflection employs a different brain network than outwardly focused attention. When our mental focus is directed toward the outside world, such as when paying attention to a lecture or being vigilant while driving on the freeway, the executive attention network typically works in opposition to the imagination network: When one is activated, the other is suppressed.20 This is why our best ideas don’t tend to arise when our attention is fully engaged elsewhere.

19. In recent years, researchers have preferred to think of different processes, rather than systems, and have gone beyond judgment and decision making to also look at the importance of a variety of processes for social cognition and creativity.17 Type 1 processes consist of a number of mental structures and states that can influence our thought and actions outside our conscious awareness or control.18 Independent of input from the conscious mind, type 1 processes drive us to action, but often without our awareness19—this system “operates unseen,”

20. effortless and spontaneous type 1 thinking, which includes creativity-boosting processes such as intuition, emotions, implicit learning, reduced latent inhibition, cognitive shortcuts (or heuristics, as psychologists call them), automatic associations based on prior experience, and evolutionarily evolved instincts.
   - Location: 1363-1366
   - Page: 89

21. Type 2 processes, on the other hand, are more effortful and controlled, and they play a greater role in a number of skills that most people tend to think of as intelligence—reflection, rationality, metaphorical and analogical thought, cause-and-effect reasoning, reality monitoring (the ability to distinguish imagination from reality), metacognition (the ability to reflect on one’s own mental activities), and executive functioning.
   - Location: 1366-1369
   - Page: 90

22. implicit learning, a critical type 1 process, is frequently a catalyst for moments of creative inspiration and insight. Neuroscientist Jeffrey Hawkins has found that when confronted with a new problem, we conjure up memories of similar situations and use these memories to create analogies that help us solve the problem.24 The more abstract we are with our connections between memories and predictions, the more skilled and sophisticated our creative thinking will be.
   - Location: 1380-1383
   - Page: 90

23. Controlled and spontaneous processes are both valuable, but at different times during the creative process.25 Spontaneous processes play the largest role during the generative phase of creative thinking, when we’re coming up with new ideas. Then, during the exploratory phase of creative cognition, we tap into the conscious, rational mind to play around with the ideas we’ve generated, and to uncover their uses. So when first approaching a creative problem, we tend to loosen and diffuse our attention and then consciously refocus that attention when it’s time to figure out how to make those ideas fly.

24. “An insight is an unexpected shift in the way we understand things,” decision-making expert Gary Klein said in a 2013 interview with the Huffington Post. “It comes without warning. It’s not something that we think is going to happen and that’s why it’s unexpected. It feels like a gift and in fact it is.”

25. insightful problem solving doesn’t solely draw on knowledge and memory, but also requires the ability to break out of habitual framing and switch perspectives or thinking strategies.

26. This recent body of research is consistent with the importance of experiencing unexpected environments for creativity (see Chapter 6), and also suggests that creative people don’t just have messy minds; they also have messy emotions. This may be why some people with bipolar disorder—which involves states of both hypomania, or exuberance, and depression—report heightened creativity.55 While there needs to be more research on this possibility,56 and bipolar disorder certainly shouldn’t be romanticized, it is becoming quite clear that intense emotions—both positive and negative—can lead to creative insights.

27. Creativity goes beyond mere knowledge and expertise; it requires the ability not only to solve but to find problems, and this calls for more than relying on tired formulas.

28. psychologists have suggested that the relationship between knowledge and creativity is best characterized by an “inverted U-shaped” curve: Some knowledge is good, but too much knowledge can impair flexibility.64 What’s more, a person’s most creative contributions in her career typically come before she reaches her peak of knowledge within the field.

29. We need new and unusual experiences to think differently. In fact, cultivating a mind-set that is open and explorative might be the best thing we can do for our creative work. As Kerouac said, “The best teacher is experience.” We need new and unusual experiences to think differently.

30. Openness to experience—the drive for cognitive exploration of one’s inner and outer worlds—is the single strongest and most consistent personality trait that predicts creative achievement.1 Openness to experience, one of the “Big Five” personality traits, is absolutely essential to creativity. Those who are high in openness tend to be imaginative, curious, perceptive, creative, artistic, thoughtful, and intellectual.2 They are driven to explore their own inner worlds of ideas, emotions, sensations, and fantasies, and outwardly, to constantly seek out and attempt to make meaning of new information in their environment.
   - Location: 1604-1610
   - Page: 105

31. Research conducted by Scott for his doctoral dissertation suggests that there are at least three major forms of cognitive engagement making up the core of the openness domain.3 Intellectual engagement is characterized by a searching for truth, love of problem solving, and drive to engage with ideas, whereas affective engagement has to do with exploration of the full depths of human emotion and is associated with a preference for using gut feeling, emotions, empathy, and compassion to make decisions. Finally, those who are high in aesthetic engagement exhibit a drive toward exploring fantasy and art and tend to experience emotional absorption in beauty. Scott found intellectual engagement to be associated with creative achievement in the sciences, while affective and aesthetic engagement were linked with artistic creativity.
   - Location: 1614-1620
   - Page: 106

32. Together, these findings suggest that the drive for exploration, in its many forms, may be the single most important personal factor predicting creative achievement.
   - Location: 1627-1628
   - Page: 107

33. openness to experience speaks to our desire and motivation to engage with ideas and emotions—to seek truth and beauty, newness and novelty—and the act of exploring often provides the raw material for great artistic and scientific innovations. This engagement starts at the neurological level, with the way the brain reacts to unfamiliar situations and new information. What unites each individual form of openness to experience is an intense desire and motivation to seek new information that is rooted in the individual’s neurophysiology and forms the very core of his or her personality.

34. Despite many popular descriptions, dopamine is not necessarily associated with pleasure and satisfaction. Instead, dopamine’s primary role is to make us want things. We get a huge surge of dopamine coursing through our brains at the possibility of a big payoff, but there’s no guarantee that we’ll actually like or enjoy what we’ve obtained. Colin DeYoung explains that the release of dopamine “increases motivation to explore and facilitates cognitive and behavioral processes useful in exploration.”6 DeYoung has called dopamine the “neuromodulator of exploration.”

35. there are crucial differences between extraversion and openness to experience. Extraversion, the personality trait that is most strongly associated with high sensitivity to environmental rewards, manifests in qualities like talkativeness, sociability, positive emotionality, assertiveness, and excitement seeking. Extraverts tend to be more likely to explore and pursue more primal “appetitive” rewards such as chocolate, social attention, social status, sexual partners, or drugs like cocaine. But dopamine, which is indeed important to extraversion, also has projections in the brain that are strongly linked to numerous other aspects of cognition. Individuals who are high in the openness to experience domain get energized not through the possibility of appetitive rewards but through the possibility of discovering new information. It’s the thrill of the knowledge chase that most excites them.

37. Another important cognitive process associated with creativity is “latent inhibition”—a filtering mechanism in the brain that determines whether we respond to an object in our environment with wonder and novelty (known as “latent inhibition”), no matter how many times we’ve seen it before and mentally tagged it as being irrelevant to our current goals and needs. Eminent creative achievers at Harvard were found to be seven times more likely to have a reduced latent inhibition15—meaning that they had a harder time filtering out seemingly irrelevant information than others. But here’s the thing: The information did turn out to be relevant! In related research, Scott found that those with a reduced latent inhibition had a greater faith in their intuitions, and their intuitions were in fact correct.

38. In a famous 2007 social experiment, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Gene Weingarten of the Washington Post offered a startling glimpse into just how much we miss in our daily lives. Here’s what happened: An average-looking man in a baseball cap and a white T-shirt set up next to a trash can in a Washington, D.C., subway station during the morning rush hour. He opened his violin case, took out the instrument, and left his open case on the ground for passersby to drop in dollar bills. More than one thousand people passed by as he performed six classical pieces over the course of forty-three minutes. The man wasn’t just any street performer. He was the famous musician and former child prodigy Joshua Bell, and he was playing Bach’s Chaconne—a piece that is generally regarded to be one of the most difficult for the violin—on a $3.5 million Stradivarius. A hidden camera recording revealed that over the course of that rush-hour performance in the subway station, only seven people stopped to watch his performance for at least a minute. However, the tape revealed that every time a child walked past Bell, they tried to stop and watch—and each time, the child was rushed along by their parents. Days before, however, concert-goers had paid up to a hundred dollars for a ticket to see Bell play the same instrument at a sold-out show in Boston.5 While this may be an extreme example, it goes to show how often we speed past the world around us—sometimes missing out on great beauty. It also begs an important question: How much more of life will we experience if we are truly present to it?

39. Pioneering Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer describes mindfulness as the act of paying attention to the present moment. Langer, who is often referred to as the “mother of mindfulness,” conducted seminal research on meditation in the 1970s and was among the first to show that exercising mindful awareness could lead to measurable improvements in cognitive function. “Mindfulness is the simple process of actively noticing new things. People always think they’re aware, but they’re not,” she explains.6
   - Location: 1904-1908
   - Page: 125

40. In her book Mindful Creativity, Langer suggests that doing creative work is itself a practice in mindfulness. “In noticing new things about the topic you’re considering to write photograph or paint about, you’re being creative,” she says. “By noticing new things about a topic, you see novel things about it. You see that the thing you thought you knew is different—everything looks different from different perspectives.”7 Mindfulness requires a firm anchoring in the here and now, openness to novelty and surprise, and sensitivity to the environment.8 Mindlessness, on the other hand, can turn us into “automatons,” says Langer—rigid and habitual in our ways of thinking and fearful of uncertainty.

41. Today, Americans spend an average of eleven hours each day interacting with digital devices,21 and the average smartphone user checks his or her device every six and a half minutes (that’s 150 times a day).22 Increasingly, our relationship with our devices has become addictive. MRI studies have shown similar brain changes in compulsive Internet users and drug addicts, and a 2011 study showed similar withdrawal effects among students who could not use technology for twenty-four hours and smokers and drug addicts quitting cold turkey.23

42. More extensive research conducted on novice meditators who completed an eight-week MBSR course and on experienced meditators who underwent a monthlong meditation retreat showed significant improvements in three aspects of attention: alerting (the maintenance of an alert state of mind), orienting (directing and limiting one’s attention), and conflict monitoring (the ability to prioritize competing responses).

43. When mind wandering is suppressed in order to completely focus attention on the present moment, mindfulness may actually prevent us from reaching our highest creative potential.
   - Location: 2079-2080
   - Page: 136

44. The goal, when it comes to enhancing creativity, is not to free the mind of thoughts. The goal is to be fully present to thoughts as they arise and to be able to switch flexibly between idle mind wandering and outward-focused attention. The goal is to be fully present to thoughts as they arise.

45. Certain types of meditation can strengthen external-focused attention while also supporting the workings of the imagination network. For instance, open-monitoring meditation, which emphasizes tuning in to one’s subjective experience, has been found to increase both the activation and the functional connectivity of the imagination network. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist who studies mindfulness, describes this technique as involving “non-reactively monitoring the content of experience from moment-to-moment, primarily as a means to recognize the nature of emotional and cognitive patterns.”40 On the other hand, traditional focused-attention meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, asks the individual to focus solely on an object such as the breath, letting go of any thoughts or emotions as they arise, and has been associated with improvements in executive functioning, as we’ve seen.

46. Lorenza Colzato, a Dutch cognitive psychologist, investigated the effects of both of these types of meditation on creative thinking. Colzato hypothesized that open-monitoring meditation—during which the individual is receptive to thoughts and emotions without attending to one particular point of focus—might be a better creativity booster than focused-attention (mindfulness) meditation, which reduces mind wandering by sustaining attention on a single object, such as the breath.41

47. The people Colzato studied had around two years of experience practicing either open-monitoring or focused-attention meditation. After a meditation session, they were asked to think of as many uses as possible for a single item (such as a brick), a test used to measure divergent thinking. After a session of open-monitoring meditation, the participants who were experienced in that type of meditation performed significantly better. Meanwhile, subjects who practiced focused-attention meditation performed better on tests of convergent thinking (that is, coming up with the single correct solution to a problem), which has been associated with IQ.

48. The data are clear: To activate your brain’s imagination network, try practicing an open-monitoring or nondirective form of meditation, which allows for constructive mind wandering while also boosting attention. Further research has suggested that, in addition to activating the imagination network and facilitating divergent thinking, one of the key ways these meditation practices boost creativity is by cultivating observational skills.

In positive, supportive environments, a child’s reactivity and sensitivity to stimuli can promote intellectual curiosity and excitement about learning, and contribute to more positive feelings toward teachers and mentors. But when sensitivity intersects with a negative childhood environment, it can contribute to negative emotions, depression, and inhibition of behavior.

## Invisible Women

### Highlights (6)

1. The female-specific concerns that men fail to factor in cover a wide variety of areas, but as you read you will notice that three themes crop up again and again: the female body, women’s unpaid care burden, and male violence against women.

2. Languages such as French, German and Spanish, however, are what is called ‘gender-inflected’, and here the concept of masculine and feminine is woven into the language itself. All nouns are gendered either masculine or feminine.
   - Location: 188-190
   - Page: 13

3. The generic masculine is also used when referring to groups of people: when the gender is unknown, or if it’s a mixed group the generic masculine is used. So a group of one hundred female teachers in Spanish would be referred to as ‘las profesoras’ – but as soon as you add a single male teacher, the group suddenly becomes ‘los profesores’. Such is the power of the default male. In gender-inflected languages the generic masculine remains pervasive. Job vacancies are still often announced with masculine forms – particularly if they are for leadership roles.
   - Location: 194-199
   - Page: 13

4. countries with gender-inflected languages, which have strong ideas of masculine and feminine present in almost every utterance, are the most unequal in terms of gender. 33 But here’s an interesting quirk: countries with genderless languages (such as Hungarian and Finnish) are not the most equal. Instead, that honour belongs to a third group, countries with ‘natural gender languages’ such as English. These languages allow gender to be marked (female teacher, male nurse) but largely don’t encode it into the words themselves. The study authors suggested that if you can’t mark gender in any way you can’t ‘correct’ the hidden bias in a language by emphasising ‘women’s presence in the world’. In short: because men go without saying, it matters when women literally can’t get said at all.

2. Marketed as “a computer on a chip,” the Intel 4004 made its public debut with an ad in Electronic News in November 1971, less than a year after Hoefler’s giddy series gave Silicon Valley its name. Only a few months later, Intel followed on with the release of the twice-as-powerful 8008, followed by the 8080 in 1974. By that time, Intel had marketing as carefully designed as the products it was selling, having brought in Regis McKenna Himself to provide vision and execution.

3. By 1975, Intel had 3,200 employees and sales of $140 million. National Semiconductor had sales of $235 million. Northern California’s 1950s and 1960s had been about manufacturing bespoke, expensive products for a small number of deep-pocketed customers: the Defense Department, NASA, the mainframe computer makers. Silicon Valley’s 1970s were about turning these small electronics into market commodities. Intel operations chief Andy Grove famously referred to the company’s products as “high technology jelly beans.”

4. Toffler declared the coming of an entirely new era in political economy, fueled by computer technology. Giant institutions of the Industrial Age—including American-style big government—would become “de-massified” and diversified. The market would become one of personal autonomy, of near-infinite consumer choice. It was a future, he wrote, “more sane, sensible and sustainable, more decent and democratic than any we have ever known.”

## The Universe: A Biography
**Author:** John Gribbin

### Highlights (12)

1. Scientific models are representations of reality, not the reality itself, and no matter how well they work or how accurate their predictions under the appropriate circumstances, they should always be regarded as approximations and aids to the imagination, rather than the ultimate truth.
   - Location: 133-135
   - Page: 9

2. Lesser scientists, and many non-scientists, have another misconception. They often think that the role of scientists today is to carry out experiments which will prove the accuracy of their models to better and better precision – to more and more decimal places. Not at all! The reason for carrying out experiments which probe previously untested predictions of the models is to find out where the models break down. It is the cherished hope of the best physicists to find flaws in their models, because those flaws – things that the models cannot predict accurately, or explain in detail – will highlight the places where we need a new understanding, with better models, to make progress.

5. More subtly, we see that not all interactions affect everything in the same way. Gravity seems to be universal and does affect everything. But electric and magnetic influences only affect certain kinds of objects.

6. Field quanta such as photons and gluons are collectively known as bosons (in honour of the Indian physicist Satyendra Bose), while the kind of entities we are used to thinking of as particles, such as electrons and quarks, are known as fermions (after the Italian Enrico Fermi).
   - Location: 377-379
   - Page: 25

7. The main difference between the two families is that bosons can be created out of pure energy without limit – every time you turn a light on, billions and billions of newly created photons flood out into the room. But the total number of fermions in the Universe has stayed the same, as far as we can tell, since the Big Bang. The only way you can make a ‘new’ fermion, such as an electron, out of energy is if, at the same time, you make a mirror-image antiparticle (in this case, a positron).
   - Location: 381-384
   - Page: 25

8. So far, we’ve identified three different fermions – the electron, the up quark and the down quark. We’ve also identified three different kinds of interaction – gravity, electromagnetism and the strong interaction.
   - Location: 387-388
   - Page: 26

9. But there is still one more fermion and one more interaction to add to the list. These additions to the standard model are required to explain a phenomenon first observed in the nineteenth century, but only satisfactorily described mathematically in the 1960s. It is called beta decay, and involves processes in which electrons (which used to be known as beta rays) are ejected from atoms. It took so long to understand what was going on because the nature of the phenomenon seemed to change as physicists probed deeper into the structure of the atom. At one level, it is no surprise that atoms can eject electrons, since all atoms contain electrons. But experiments showed that the electrons involved in beta decay actually come from the nuclei of atoms, and nuclei do not contain electrons, only neutrons and protons. Then, the experimenters discovered that in beta decay a neutron spits out an electron, and converts itself into a proton. There is no change in the total electric charge in the Universe, since the positive and negative cancel out, but an extra fermion seems to have been created. In addition, in order to balance the energy and momentum of the ejected electron, it seemed there ought to be an invisible particle flying away from the decaying neutron in the opposite direction.

12. To give you some idea of how difficult life is for a photon trapped inside such a plasma, a photon starting out from the heart of the Sun travels, on average, just one centimetre before it collides with a charged particle and bounces off in a random direction. So it moves in zig-zag steps each about a centimetre long, and typically takes 10 million years to get to the surface, even though it is travelling at the speed of light. If it could go in a straight line from the centre of the Sun to the surface, its journey would take just 2.5 seconds. But it has literally travelled a total of 10 million light years – backwards, forwards and sideways in centimetre steps – on its way out. If the zig-zag path were straightened out, it would stretch five times farther than the distance from here to the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest large neighbour of our Milky Way. It is only at the surface of the Sun, where electrons combine with nuclei to make neutral atoms, that the photons can stream freely out into space.

## The Scientists
**Author:** John Gribbin

### Highlights (29)

1. By a happy coincidence for the historian, one of the landmark events at the start of the biological investigation of the human body was the publication of De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Structure of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius in 1543, the same year that Copernicus eventually published De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolutions of Celestial Bodies). This coincidence makes 1543 a convenient marker for the start of the scientific revolution that would transform first Europe and then the world.

2. If a modern scientist has a bright idea about the way the Universe works, his or her first objective is to find a way to test the idea by experiment or observation, to find out how good it is as a description of the world. But this key step in developing the scientific method had not been taken in the fifteenth century, and it never occurred to Copernicus to test his idea – his mental model of how the Universe works – by making new observations himself, or by encouraging others to make new observations. To Copernicus, his model was better than that of Ptolemy because it was, in modern parlance, more elegant. Elegance is often a reliable guide to the usefulness of a model, but not an infallible one. In this case, though, it eventually turned out that Copernicus’s intuition was right.

3. Although Galileo is one of the towering figures in science, known by name to every educated person today, and Gilbert is less well known than he deserves, Gilbert had the earlier birth date and, chronologically speaking at least, deserves the title of the first scientist. William Gilbert is the name that he has become known by in the history books, although the preferred contemporary spelling used by his own family was Gilberd. He was born on 24 May 15441 in Colchester, in the county of Essex,

6. While in Rome, Galileo also became a member of what is regarded as the first scientific society in the world, a group known as the Lyncean Academy, which had been founded by four young aristocrats in 1603. It was at a banquet held in honour of Galileo by the ‘lynxes’ that the name ‘telescope’ was first suggested for his magnifying device.

8. this is the system that involves manipulating ‘powers of ten’ rather than ordinary numbers, so that (to take a very simple example) 100 × 1000 becomes 102 × 103, which (since 2 + 3 = 5) becomes 105, or 100,000. All ordinary numbers can be represented in this sort of way (for example, 2345 can be written as 103.37, so that the logarithm of 2345 is 3.37), which means all multiplication and division can be reduced to addition and subtraction (once someone has gone to the trouble of preparing tables of logarithms). In the days before pocket calculators (which means right up until the 1970s), logarithms and the associated tool which uses logarithms, the slide rule, were the only things that made complex calculations feasible for most people.

9. The foundation of the first Royal Societies (or Academies) of science around this time was itself a significant landmark in the history of science, marking the middle of the seventeenth century as the time when scientific investigation began to become part of the establishment. The first such scientific society to receive an official imprimatur was the Accademia del Cimento (Academy of Experiment), founded in Florence in 1657 by two of Galileo’s former pupils, Evangelista Torricelli and Vincenzo Viviani, under the patronage of Grand Duke Ferdinando II and his brother Leopold. This was the spiritual successor of the failed Lyncean Society, which never recovered from the death of Frederico Cesi. But the Accademia del Cimento itself lasted for only ten years, and its demise in 1667 defines as well as anything the date when the Italian leadership in physical sciences that had been inspired by the Renaissance came to an end. By then, what was to become the longest continuously enduring scientific society in the world had already begun to meet in London. From 1645 onwards, a group of scientifically minded people began to get together regularly in London to discuss new ideas and to communicate new discoveries to one another and by letters to like-minded thinkers across Europe. In 1662, under a charter of Charles II, this became the Royal Society (as the first such society, it needs no other description; it is the Royal Society, sometimes simply referred to as ‘the Royal’).
   - Location: 2373-2383

10. But although Royal in name, the London-based society was a collection of private individuals with no official source of funding and no obligations to the government. Huygens became one of the first foreign members of the Royal Society on a brief visit to London in 1663. The French equivalent, the Académie des Sciences, founded four years after the Royal received its charter, had the benefits of being a government institution, set up under the patronage of Louis XIV (the grandson of Henry IV), which allowed it to provide financial support and practical facilities for eminent scientists such as Huygens, but which also gave it certain (sometimes onerous) obligations. The success of the two societies in their different ways spawned many imitations (usually patterned after one or the other model), starting with the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin in 1700.

11. The enormous conceptual leap required to appreciate that the speed of light, although very large, was not infinite, stemmed from the work of Ole Rømer, a Dane who carried out the work while he was a contemporary of Huygens at the French Academy. Rømer was born at Århus on 25 September 1644, and after studying at the University of Copenhagen he stayed on there as assistant to the physicist and astronomer Erasmus Bartholin.

12. each moon ought to be eclipsed behind Jupiter at regular intervals. Rømer noticed, though, that the interval between these eclipses was not always the same, and varied in a way that was related to the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun, relative to the position of Jupiter. He interpreted this as being a result of the finite speed of light – when the Earth is further away from Jupiter we see the eclipses later, because it has taken the light carrying news of those eclipses longer to travel from Jupiter to our telescopes.
   - Location: 2410-2414
   - Page: 158

13. Rømer calculated from this time delay that the speed of light must be (in modern units) 225,00 kilometres per second. Using the same calculation but plugging in the best modern estimate of the size of the Earth’s orbit, Rømer’s own observations give the speed of light as 298,000 kilometres per second. This is stunningly close to the modern value for the speed of light, 299,792 kilometres per second, given that it was the first measurement, ever, of this speed.

14. The real relevance of the near-simultaneous discovery of oxygen by Scheele and by Priestley, though, is not who did it first, but that it reminds us that in most cases science progresses incrementally, building on what has already been discovered and making use of the technology of the day, so that it is largely a matter of luck which individual makes which discovery first, and who gets their name in the history book. For better or worse, it is Priestley whose name is associated with the discovery of oxygen, even though Scheele undoubtedly discovered it first, and even though Priestley continued to try to explain his discoveries in terms of the phlogiston model.

15. Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis (1698–1759) just a year later, in 1744. De Maupertuis had been a soldier before turning to science; his big idea is known as the principle of least action. ‘Action’ is the name given by physicists to a property of a body which is measured in terms of the changing position of an object and its momentum (that is, it relates mass, velocity and distance travelled by a particle). The principle of least action says that nature always operates to keep this quantity to a minimum (in other words, nature is lazy). This turned out to be hugely important in quantum mechanics, but the simplest example of the principle of least action at work is that light always travels in straight lines.

16. From his study of the visible world, Hutton concluded that no great acts of violence (such as the Biblical Flood) were needed to explain the present-day appearance of the globe, but that if enough time were available everything we see could be explained in terms of the same processes that we see around us today, with mountains being worn away by erosion and sediments being laid down on the sea floor before being uplifted to form new mountains by repeated earthquake and volcanic activity of the kind we see today, not by huge earthquakes which threw up new mountain ranges overnight. This became known as the principle of uniformitarianism – the same uniform processes are at work all the time and mould the surface of the Earth continually. The idea that occasional great acts of violence are needed to explain the observed features of the Earth became known as catastrophism.

17. 15.Both these terms are still misused by people trying to discredit rival ideas; the most important point of confusion is that because the history of the Earth is so long, events that seem rare and dramatic on a human timescale (such as large meteors hitting the Earth), and which are certainly catastrophic in the everyday meaning of the word, are both normal and, in geological terminology, uniformitarian as far as the history of the planet is concerned. It’s all a matter of perspective. To a butterfly that lives only for one day, nightfall is a catastrophe; to us, it is routine. To us, a new Ice Age would be a catastrophe; to Planet Earth, it is routine.

18. It turns out that the chemical properties of an element depend on the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom (the atomic number), while its atomic weight depends on the total number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus. The modern version of the periodic table ranks the elements in order of increasing atomic number, not increasing atomic weight; but in by far the majority of cases, elements with higher atomic number also have greater atomic weight. In just a few rare cases the presence of an extra couple of neutrons makes the ranking of elements by atomic weight slightly different from the ranking in order of atomic number.

22. The person who, more than anyone else, gave shape to the subatomic world, putting these discoveries into some sort of order and gaining the first understanding of the structure of the atom, was Ernest Rutherford.
   - Location: 8878-8880
   - Page: 579

23. Later experiments showed that the nucleus occupies only about one hundred-thousandth of the diameter of an atom; typically, a nucleus 10–13 centimetres across is embedded in an electron cloud 10–8 centimetres across. In very rough terms, the proportions are those of a grain of sand relative to Carnegie Hall. Atoms are mostly empty space, filled with a web of electromagnetic forces linking the positive and negative charges. Which means (which surely would have delighted Faraday) that everything we think of as solid matter, including the book you are reading and the chair you are sitting on, is mostly empty space, filled with a web of electromagnetic forces linking the positive and negative charges.
   - Location: 8971-8976
   - Page: 586

24. The problem with Rutherford’s model of the atom as a tiny central nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons moving in empty space was that there was nothing to stop the electrons falling into the nucleus. After all, the nucleus has positive charge and the electrons have negative charge, so they must attract each other. In seeking how to stabilize such a system, it is possible to make an analogy with the planets in orbit around the Sun – but unfortunately, the analogy doesn’t hold up. To be sure, the planets are attracted to the Sun by gravity, and would ‘like’ to fall towards it, but are kept in their orbits by their motion, in a sense balancing centrifugal force against the pull of gravity. But electrons cannot orbit the nucleus of the atom in the same way because they have electric charge, and because they have to change direction to move in an orbit around the nucleus they are accelerated – as for the Moon orbiting the Earth, acceleration means a change in either the speed or direction of motion, or both. An electric charge which accelerates will radiate energy away in the form of electromagnetic waves, and as it loses energy in this way, an electron ‘in orbit’ around a nucleus would spiral into the nucleus and the atom would collapse, on a timescale of about one ten-billionth of a second.14 There is no way to avoid this dilemma within the framework of the classical physics of Newton and Maxwell. The reason why atoms are stable is entirely thanks to quantum physics, and the first person to appreciate how this might happen was the Dane Niels Bohr.

25. What de Broglie’s equation tells us is that everything has dual wave–particle character. Because momentum is related to mass (except for light, which is so often a special case and where photons have no mass in the everyday sense of the term), and because Planck’s constant is so small, the ‘waviness’ of an everyday object, such as you or me, a house, or a football, is so utterly tiny that it can never be detected. The waviness only becomes important when the mass of an object is (in the appropriate units) about the same size as, or less than, Planck’s constant. Which means that the wave aspect of wave–particle duality scarcely matters at all above the molecular level, cannot entirely be ignored for whole atoms, is an important factor in describing the behaviour of protons and neutrons, and is absolutely crucial in trying to describe the behaviour of electrons, inside or outside atoms. This also tells us that we have no hope of understanding what an electron ‘really is’ in terms of our everyday, common-sense experience. It is literally like nothing we have ever seen. All we can hope to do is to find equations – mathematical models – which tell us how electrons behave in different circumstances, sometimes more like a wave, sometimes more like a particle.

26. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle: wave–particle duality Heisenberg made another contribution to quantum physics, though, which is worth discussing here – his famous uncertainty principle. This is related to the idea of wave–particle duality, and says that certain pairs of quantum properties, such as position and momentum, can never both be precisely defined at the same time; there is always a residue of uncertainty (related to the size of Planck’s constant, so again these effects only show up on very small scales) in the value of at least one of these parameters. The more accurately one member of the pair is constrained, the less accurately the other one is constrained. This is not simply a matter of our imperfect measuring apparatus disturbing the quantum world when we try to measure it, so that, for example, if we try to measure the position of an electron we give it a nudge and change its momentum. It is a fundamental feature of the quantum world, so that an electron itself does not ‘know’ both precisely where it is and precisely where it is going at the same time. As Heisenberg himself put it, in a paper published in 1927, ‘we cannot know, as a matter of principle, the present in all its details’. It turned out that this is such a fundamental aspect of the way the world works that it is possible to construct the entire edifice of quantum mechanics starting out from the uncertainty principle, although we won’t go into that here. The power of the uncertainty principle can, though, be gleaned by returning to the puzzle of why the electrons in an atom don’t all fall into the nucleus, even if they have to do it in a series of jumps, rather than by spiralling inwards. When an electron is in orbit around a nucleus, its momentum is very well determined by the properties of the orbit, so any uncertainty in the momentum-position pair is forced to be in its position. If an electron is somewhere in an orbit, there is indeed uncertainty in its position – it could be on one side of the orbit or the other (or it could, if you prefer that picture, be a wave spread around the orbit). But if it fell right into the nucleus, its position would be very well determined – within the volume of the nucleus. Its momentum would also be very well determined, since it would not be going anywhere. This would violate the uncertainty principle (if you like to think of it that way, you could say that a nucleus is too small for the wave associated with an electron to fit inside it). Put the appropriate numbers in, with the appropriate momentum for an electron in an atom, and it turns out that the size of the smallest electron orbit in an atom is as small as it can be without violating the uncertainty principle. The very sizes of atoms (and the fact that atoms exist at all!) are determined by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.

27. Some strong force, stronger than the electric force over the very short distances, represented by the diameter of an atomic nucleus, must overwhelm the electric repulsion and hold everything together. Rather prosaically, this became known as the strong nuclear force or just ‘the strong force’. Experiments later showed that this force is about a hundred times stronger than the electric force, which is why there are about a hundred protons in the largest stable nuclei; any more, and electric repulsion overcomes the strong force and blows the nucleus apart. But the strong force, unlike electric, magnetic and gravitational forces, does not obey an inverse square law. It is very strong indeed over a limited range of about 10–13 centimetres, and essentially cannot be felt at all beyond that range. This is why nuclei have the size they do – if the strong force had longer range, nuclei would be correspondingly larger.

28. When the time came to submit the paper, Gamow, an inveterate joker, decided (overriding Alpher’s objections) to add the name of his old friend Hans Bethe (1906–) as co-author, for the sole reason that he liked the sound of the names Alpher, Bethe, Gamow (alpha, beta, gamma). To his delight, by a coincidence the paper appeared in the issue of Physical Review dated 1 April 1948. That publication marks the beginning of Big Bang cosmology as a quantitative science.

29. what motivates the great scientists is not the thirst for fame or fortune (although that can be a seductive lure for the less-than-great scientists), but what Richard Feynman called ‘the pleasure of finding things out’, a pleasure so satisfying that many of those great scientists, from Newton to Cavendish and from Charles Darwin to Feynman himself, have not even bothered to publish their findings unless pressed by their friends to do so, but a pleasure that would hardly exist if there were no truths to discover.

## Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts
**Author:** Stanislas Dehaene

### Highlights (51)

1. the contemporary science of consciousness distinguishes a minimum of three concepts: vigilance—the state of wakefulness, which varies when we fall asleep or wake up; attention—the focusing of our mental resources onto a specific piece of information; and conscious access—the fact that some of the attended information eventually enters our awareness and becomes reportable to others. What counts as genuine consciousness, I will argue, is conscious access—the simple fact that usually, whenever we are awake, whatever we decide to focus on may become conscious. Neither vigilance nor attention alone is sufficient. When we are fully awake and attentive, sometimes we can see an object and describe our perception to others, but sometimes we cannot—perhaps the object was too faint, or it was flashed too briefly to be visible. In the first case, we are said to enjoy conscious access, and in the second we are not (and yet as we shall see, our brain may be processing the information unconsciously). In the new science of consciousness, conscious access is a well-defined phenomenon, distinct from vigilance and attention.

2. A visual illusion called “Troxler fading” illustrates one of the many ways in which the subjective content of consciousness can be manipulated. Stare intently at the central cross. After a few seconds, some of the gray dots should vanish, then return at random moments. The objective stimulus is constant, but its subjective interpretation keeps changing.

3. Three features of this research program suddenly put conscious perception within experimental reach. First, the illusions did not require an elaborate notion of consciousness—just the simple act of seeing or not seeing, what I have called conscious access. Second, a great many illusions were available for study—as we shall see, cognitive scientists have invented dozens of techniques to make words, pictures, sounds, and even gorillas disappear at will. And third, such illusions are eminently subjective—only you can tell when and where the dots disappear in your mind. Yet the results are reproducible: anyone who watches the figure reports having the same kind of experience.

4. Science often progresses by carving out new distinctions that refine the fuzzy categories of natural language. In the history of science, a classic example is the separation of the concepts of heat and temperature. Everyday intuition treats them as one and the same. After all, adding heat to something will increase its temperature, right? Wrong—a block of ice, when heated, will melt while staying at a fixed temperature of zero degrees Celsius. A material may have a high temperature (e.g., a firework spark, which may reach a few thousand degrees Celsius) but have so little heat that it won’t burn the skin (because it has very little mass). In the nineteenth century, distinguishing heat (the amount of energy transferred) from temperature (the average kinetic energy in a body) was key to making progress in thermodynamics.

5. most if not all of the selective functions of attention have to operate outside our awareness. How could we ever think, if we first had to consciously sift through all the candidate objects of our thoughts? Attention’s sieve operates largely unconsciously—attention is dissociable from conscious access.

6. In a nutshell, selective attention and conscious access are distinct processes. There is a third concept that we need to carefully set apart: vigilance, also called “intransitive consciousness.” In English, the adjective conscious can be transitive: we can be conscious of a trend, a touch, a tingle, or a toothache. In this case, the word denotes “conscious access,” the fact that an object may or may not enter our awareness. But conscious can also be intransitive, as when we say “the wounded soldier remained conscious.”

7. In this sense, consciousness is a general faculty that we lose during sleep, when we faint, or when we undergo general anesthesia.

8. scientists often refer to this sense of consciousness as “wakefulness” or “vigilance.” Even these two terms should probably be separated: wakefulness refers primarily to the sleep-wake cycle, which arises from subcortical mechanisms, whereas vigilance refers to the level of excitement in the cortical and thalamic networks that support conscious states. Both concepts, however, differ sharply from conscious access. Wakefulness, vigilance, and attention are just enabling conditions for conscious access.

9. While our brain lets us see a stable three-dimensional world, it hides from our sight the amazingly complex operations that underlie this feat. At any given time, each of our eyes receives a slightly different image of the external world—yet we do not experience double vision. Under natural conditions, we typically fail to notice the two images and simply fuse them together into a single homogeneous visual scene. Our brain even takes advantage of the slight space between our two eyes, which induces a relative shift in the two images. As first observed by the English scientist Charles Wheatstone in 1838, it exploits this disparity to locate objects in depth, thus giving us a vivid sense of the third dimension. But what would happen, Wheatstone wondered, if the two eyes received completely different images, such as a picture of a face in one eye and of a house in the other? Would the images still be fused? Could we see two unrelated scenes at once? To find out, Wheatstone built a device that he dubbed the stereoscope. (It quickly started a craze for stereo pictures, from landscapes to pornography, that lasted throughout the Victorian era and beyond.) Two mirrors, placed in front of the left and right eyes, allowed the presentation of distinct pictures to the two eyes (figure 4). To Wheatstone’s amazement, when the two pictures were unrelated (such as a face and a house), vision became utterly unstable. Instead of fusing the scene, the viewer’s perception ceaselessly alternated between one image and the other, with only brief transitions between them. For a few seconds, the face would appear; then it would break down and vanish to reveal the house; and so on in a alternation created solely by the brain. As Wheatstone noted, “It does not appear to be in the power of the will to determine the appearance” of either image. Rather the brain, when confronted with an utterly implausible stimulus, seems to waver between two interpretations: face or house. The two incompatible images seem to fight for conscious perception—hence the term binocular rivalry.

10. new method called “continuous flash suppression,” it is now possible to keep one of the two images permanently out of sight, by continuously flashing a stream of bright colorful rectangles into the other eye, such that only this dynamic stream is seen.16 What is the main point of these binocular illusions? They demonstrate that it is possible for a visual image to be physically presented in the eye for a long duration, and to progress into the brain areas dedicated to visual processing, yet be totally suppressed from conscious experience.

11. A stream of symbols appears at the same location on a computer screen. Most of the symbols are digits, but some are letters, which the participant is told to remember. The first letter is easily remembered. If a second letter occurs half a second or more after the first, it too is accurately committed to memory. If the two letters appear in close succession, however, the second one is often completely missed. The viewer reports seeing only one letter and is quite surprised to learn that there were two of them. The very act of attending to the first letter creates a temporary “blink of the mind” that annihilates the perception of the second.

12. For the most spectacular demonstration of visual unawareness, connect to YouTube and search for Whodunnit?, a brief detective movie commissioned by the London transportation department.31 A distinguished British detective grills three suspects and ends up arresting one of them. Nothing suspicious . . . until the movie rewinds, the camera backs up, and we suddenly realize that we missed massive anomalies. Within one minute, no fewer than twenty-one elements of the visual scene were incoherently changed, right in front of our eyes. Five assistants swapped the furniture, replaced a huge stuffed bear with a medieval suit of armor, and helped the actors change their coats and trade the objects that they held. A naïve spectator misses it all.

13. In many experiments, the boundary between seeing and not seeing is relatively sharp: an image is downright invisible when presented for 40 milliseconds, but is easily seen, on most trials, when the duration is increased to 60 milliseconds. This finding justifies the use of the words subliminal (below threshold) and supraliminal (above threshold). Metaphorically, the gateway to consciousness is a well-defined threshold, and a flashed image is either in or out. The length of the threshold varies across subjects, but it always falls close to 50 milliseconds. At this duration, one perceives the flashed image about half the time.

14. What kind of brain representation, Blanke asked, underlies our adoption of a specific point of view on the external world? How does the brain assess the body’s location? After investigating many neurological and surgery patients, Blanke discovered that a cortical region in the right temporoparietal junction, when impaired or electrically perturbed, repeatedly caused a sensation of out-of-body transportation.41 This region is situated in a high-level zone where multiple signals converge: those arising from vision; from the somatosensory and kinesthetic systems (our brain’s map of bodily touch, muscular, and action signals); and from the vestibular system (the biological inertial platform, located in our inner ear, which monitors our head movements). By piecing together these various clues, the brain generates an integrated representation of the body’s location relative to its environment. However, this process can go awry if the signals disagree or become ambiguous as a result of brain damage. Out-of-body flight “really” happens, then—it is a real physical event, but only in the patient’s brain and, as a result, in his subjective experience. The out-of-body state is, by and large, an exacerbated form of the dizziness that we all experience when our vision disagrees with our vestibular system, as on a rocking boat. Blanke went on to show that any human can leave her body: he created just the right amount of stimulation, via synchronized but delocalized visual and touch signals, to elicit an out-of-body experience in the normal brain.42 Using a clever robot, he even managed to re-create the illusion in a magnetic resonance imager. And while the scanned person experienced the illusion, her brain lit up in the temporoparietal junction—very close to where the patient’s lesions were located.

15. How deep can an invisible image travel into the brain? Can it reach our higher cortical centers and influence the decisions we make? Answering these questions is crucial to delineating the unique contours of conscious thought. Recent experiments in psychology and brain imaging have tracked the fate of unconscious pictures in the brain. We recognize and categorize masked images unconsciously, and we even decipher and interpret unseen words. Subliminal pictures trigger motivations and rewards in us—all without our awareness. Even complex operations linking perception to action can unfold covertly, demonstrating how frequently we rely on an unconscious “automatic pilot.” Oblivious to this boiling hodgepodge of unconscious processes, we constantly overestimate the power of our consciousness in making decisions—but in truth, our capacity for conscious control is limited.

16. As noted by the historian and philosopher Marcel Gauchet, “When Freud declares, in substance, that prior to psychoanalysis the mind was systematically identified with consciousness, we have to declare this statement rigorously false.”2 In truth, the realization that many of our mental operations occur sub rosa, and that consciousness is only a thin veneer lying atop sundry unconscious processors, predates Freud by decades or even centuries.3 In Roman antiquity, the physician Galen (ca. 129–200) and the philosopher Plotinus (ca. 204–270) had already noticed that some of the body’s operations, such as walking and breathing, occur without attention. Much of their medical knowledge was in fact inherited from Hippocrates (ca. 460–377 BC), a keen observer of diseases whose name remains an emblem of the medical profession. Hippocrates wrote an entire treatise on epilepsy, called The Sacred Disease, in which he noted that the body suddenly misbehaves against its owner’s will. He concluded that the brain constantly controls us and covertly weaves the fabric of our mental life: Men ought to know that from the brain, and from the brain alone, arise our pleasures, joys, laughter and jests, as well as our sorrows, pains, grieves and tears. Through it, in particular, we think, see, hear and distinguish the ugly from the beautiful, the bad from the good, the pleasant from the unpleasant. During the Dark Ages, which followed the fall of the Roman Empire, Indian and Arab scholars preserved some of antiquity’s medical wisdom. In the eleventh century, the Arab scientist known as Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham, 965–1040) discovered the main principles of visual perception. Centuries before Descartes, he understood that the eye operates as a camera obscura, a receiver rather than an emitter of light, and he foresaw that various illusions could fool our conscious perception.4 Consciousness was not always in control, Alhazen concluded. He was the first to postulate an automatic process of unconscious inference: unknown to us, the brain jumps to conclusions beyond the available sense data, sometimes causing us to see things that are not there.5 Eight centuries later the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, in his 1867 book, Physiological Optics, would use the very same term, unconscious inference, to describe how our vision automatically computes the best interpretation compatible with incoming sense data. Beyond the issue of unconscious perception lay the greater issue of the origins of our deepest motives and desires. Centuries before Freud, many philosophers—including Augustine (354–430), Thomas Aquinas (1225–74), Descartes (1596–1650), Spinoza (1632–77), and Leibniz (1646–1716)—noted that the course of human actions is driven by a broad array of mechanisms that are inaccessible to introspection, from sensorimotor reflexes to unaware motives and hidden desires. Spinoza cited a hodgepodge of unconscious drives: a child’s desire for milk, an injured person’s will for revenge, a drunkard’s craving for the bottle, and a chatterbox’s uncontrollable speech. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the first neurologists discovered proof after proof of the omnipresence of unconscious circuits in the nervous system. Marshall Hall (1790–1857) pioneered the concept of a “reflex arc,” linking specific sensory inputs to particular motor outputs, and he emphasized our lack of voluntary control over basic movements that originate in the spinal cord. Following in his footsteps, John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911) underscored the hierarchical organization of the nervous system, from the brain stem to the cerebral cortex and from automatic operations to increasingly voluntary and conscious ones. In France, the psychologists and sociologists Théodule Ribot (1839–1916), Gabriel Tarde (1843–1904), and Pierre Janet (1859–1947) stressed the broad range of human automatisms, from practical knowledge stored in our action memory (Ribot) to unconscious imitation (Tarde) and even to subconscious goals that date from early childhood and become defining facets of our personality (Janet).

17. We never see the world as our retina sees it. In fact, it would be a pretty horrible sight: a highly distorted set of light and dark pixels, blown up toward the center of the retina, masked by blood vessels, with a massive hole at the location of the “blind spot” where cables leave for the brain; the image would constantly blur and change as our gaze moved around. What we see, instead, is a three-dimensional scene, corrected for retinal defects, mended at the blind spot, stabilized for our eye and head movements, and massively reinterpreted based on our previous experience of similar visual scenes. All these operations unfold unconsciously—although many of them are so complicated that they resist computer modeling. For instance, our visual system detects the presence of shadows in the image and removes them (figure 10). At a glance, our brain unconsciously infers the sources of lights and deduces the shape, opacity, reflectance, and luminance of the objects.

18. Even multisensory information can be bound together unconsciously—we become aware only of the result. We owe this conclusion to a remarkable illusion called the “McGurk effect,” first described by Harry McGurk and John MacDonald in 1976.31 The video, which can be found on the Internet,32 shows a person speaking, and it seems obvious that she is saying da da da da. Nothing puzzling—until you close your eyes and realize that the true auditory stimulus is the syllable ba ba ba! How does the illusion work? Visually, the mouth of the person moves to say ga—but because your ears receive the syllable ba, your brain is confronted with a conflict. It solves it, unconsciously, by fusing the two pieces of information. If the two inputs are well synchronized, it binds the information together into a single intermediate percept: the syllable da, a compromise between the auditory ba and the visual ga. This auditory illusion shows us again how late and reconstructed our conscious experience is. As surprising as it seems, we do not hear the sound waves that reach our ears; nor do we see the photons entering our eyes. What we gain access to is not a raw sensation but an expert reconstruction of the outside world.

19. our unconscious mind is clever enough to store and retrieve, in parallel, all the possible semantic associations of a word, even when the word is ambiguous and even when only one of its meanings actually fits in the context. The unconscious mind proposes while the conscious mind selects.

20. A return from the over-estimation of the property of consciousness is the indispensable preliminary to any genuine insight into the course of psychic events. —Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams (1900) Freud was right: consciousness is overrated. Consider this simple truism: we are conscious only of our conscious thoughts. Because our unconscious operations elude us, we constantly overestimate the role that consciousness plays in our physical and mental lives. By forgetting the amazing power of the unconscious, we overattribute our actions to conscious decisions and therefore mischaracterize our consciousness as a major player in our daily lives. In the words of the Princeton psychologist Julian Jaynes, “Consciousness is a much smaller part of our mental life than we are conscious of, because we cannot be conscious of what we are not conscious of.”

21. Why did consciousness evolve? Can some operations be carried out only by a conscious mind? Or is consciousness a mere epiphenomenon, a useless or even illusory feature of our biological makeup? In fact, consciousness supports a number of specific operations that cannot unfold unconsciously. Subliminal information is evanescent, but conscious information is stable—we can hang on to it for as long as we wish. Consciousness also compresses the incoming information, reducing an immense stream of sense data to a small set of carefully selected bite-size symbols. The sampled information can then be routed to another processing stage, allowing us to perform carefully controlled chains of operations, much like a serial computer. This broadcasting function of consciousness is essential. In humans, it is greatly enhanced by language, which lets us distribute our conscious thoughts across the social network.

22. The existence of this probabilistic law shows that even as we are consciously perceiving an interpretation of an ambiguous scene, our brain is still pondering all the other interpretations and remains ready to change its mind at any moment. Behind the scenes, an unconscious Sherlock endlessly computes with probability distributions: as Peirce inferred, “the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction.” Consciously, however, all we get to see is a single sample. As a result, vision does not feel like a complex exercise in mathematics; we open our eyes, and our conscious brain lets in only a single sight. Paradoxically, the sampling that goes on in our conscious vision makes us forever blind to its inner complexity. Sampling seems to be a genuine function of conscious access, in the sense that it does not occur in the absence of conscious attention. Consider binocular rivalry, which you might remember from Chapter 1: the unstable perception that results from presenting two distinct images to the two eyes. When we attend to them, the images ceaselessly alternate in our awareness. Although the sensory input is fixed and ambiguous, we perceive it as constantly changing, as we become aware of only one image at a time. Crucially, however, when we orient our attention elsewhere, the rivalry stops.11 Discrete sampling seems to occur only when we consciously attend. As a consequence, unconscious processes are more objective than conscious ones. Our army of unconscious neurons approximates the true probability distribution of the states of the world, while our consciousness shamelessly reduces it to all-or-none samples. The whole process bears an intriguing analogy to quantum mechanics (although its neural mechanisms most likely involve only classical physics). Quantum physicists tell us that physical reality consists in a superposition of wave functions that determine the probability of finding a particle in a certain state. Whenever we care to measure, however, these probabilities collapse to a fixed all-or-none state. We never observe strange mixtures such as the famed Schrödinger’s cat, half alive and half dead. According to quantum theory, the very act of physical measurement forces the probabilities to collapse into a single discrete measure. In our brain, something similar happens: the very act of consciously attending to an object collapses the probability distribution of its various interpretations and lets us perceive only one of them. Consciousness acts as a discrete measurement device that grants us a single glimpse of the vast underlying sea of unconscious computations. Still, this seductive analogy may be superficial. Only future research will tell us whether some of the mathematics behind quantum mechanics can be adapted to the cognitive neuroscience of conscious perception. What is certain, though, is that in our brains, such a division of labor is ubiquitous: unconscious processes act as fast and massively parallel statisticians, while consciousness is a slow sampler.

23. There may be a very good reason why our consciousness condenses sensory messages into a synthetic code, devoid of gaps and ambiguities: such a code is compact enough to be carried forward in time, entering what we usually call “working memory.” Working memory and consciousness seem to be tightly related.

24. The lifetime of a subliminal stimulus can be estimated by measuring how long one has to wait before its effect decays to zero. The result is very clear: a visible image may have a long-lasting effect, but an invisible one exerts only a short-lived influence on our thoughts. Whenever we render an image invisible by masking, it nevertheless activates visual, orthographic, lexical, or even semantic representations in the brain, but only for a brief duration. After a second or so, the unconscious activation generally decays to an undetectable level.

26. All together, then, these experiments point to a crucial role for consciousness. We need to be conscious in order to rationally think through a problem. The mighty unconscious generates sophisticated hunches, but only a conscious mind can follow a rational strategy, step after step. By acting as a router, feeding information through any arbitrary string of successive processes, consciousness seems to give us access to a whole new mode of operation—the brain’s Turing machine.

28. Thanks to human language, as well as to nonverbal pointing and gesturing, the conscious synthesis that emerges in one mind can be rapidly transferred to others. This active social transmission of a conscious symbol offers new computational abilities. Humans can create “multicore” social algorithms that do not draw solely on the knowledge available to a single mind but rather allow the confrontation of multiple points of view, variable levels of expertise, and a diversity of sources of knowledge.

Vladimir Nabokov, in his Lectures on Literature (1980), saw it all: Literature was not born the day when a boy crying “wolf, wolf” came running out of the Neanderthal valley with a big gray wolf at his heels; literature was born on the day when a boy came crying “wolf, wolf” and there was no wolf behind him.

30. In the 1960s an even better technology emerged: magnetoencephalography (MEG), the ultra-precise recording of the minuscule magnetic waves that accompany the discharge of currents in cortical neurons. Both EEG and MEG can be recorded very simply, either by placing small electrical leads on the head (EEG) or by placing very sensitive detectors of magnetic fields around it (MEG). With fMRI, EEG, and MEG in hand, we can now track the entire sequence of brain activation as a visual stimulus travels from the retina to the highest reaches of the frontal cortex.

31. René Descartes would have been delighted; he was the first to note that “we cannot be very attentive to several things at once,” a limitation of consciousness that he attributed to the simple mechanical fact that the pineal gland could lean to only one side at a time.

32. An important consequence of these observations is that our consciousness of unexpected events lags considerably behind the real world. Not only do we consciously perceive only a very small proportion of the sensory signals that bombard us, but when we do, it is with a time lag of at least one-third of a second. In this respect, our brain is like an astronomer who watches for supernovae. Because the speed of light is finite, the news from distant stars takes millions of years to reach us. Likewise, because our brain accumulates evidence at a sluggish speed, the information that we attribute to the conscious “present” is outdated by at least one-third of a second. The duration of this blind period may even exceed half a second when the input is so faint that it calls for a slow accumulation of evidence before crossing the threshold for conscious perception.

33. As we just saw, consciousness can be delayed even further when the mind is occupied elsewhere. This is why you should not use your cell phone while driving—even a seemingly reflex response, such as hitting the brakes when you see the taillights of the car in front of you, slows down when your conscious mind is distracted.

34. Fortunately, our brain also contains exquisite mechanisms that compensate for these delays. First, we often rely on an unconscious “autopilot.” As René Descartes observed long ago, a burnt finger retracts from the fire way before we become aware of the pain.

37. One interesting tool that my colleagues and I have applied to our brain recordings is “Granger causality analysis.” Back in 1969 the British economist Clive Granger invented this method to determine when two time series—for instance, two economic indicators—are related in such a manner that one may be said to “cause” the other. Recently, the method has been extended to neuroscience.

All our conscious experiences, from the sound of an orchestra to the smell of burnt toast, result from a similar source: the activity of massive cerebral circuits that have reproducible neuronal signatures. During conscious perception, groups of neurons begin to fire in a coordinated manner, first in local specialized regions, then in the vast expanses of our cortex. Ultimately, they invade much of the prefrontal and parietal lobes, while remaining tightly synchronized with earlier sensory regions. It is at this point, where a coherent brain web suddenly ignites, that conscious awareness seems to be established.

39. In this chapter, we discovered no fewer than four reliable signatures of consciousness—physiological markers that index whether the participant experienced a conscious percept. First, a conscious stimulus causes an intense neuronal activation that leads to a sudden ignition of parietal and prefrontal circuits. Second, in the EEG, conscious access is accompanied by a slow wave called the P3 wave, which emerges as late as one-third of a second after the stimulus. Third, conscious ignition also triggers a late and sudden burst of high-frequency oscillations. Finally, many regions exchange bidirectional and synchronized messages over long distances in the cortex, thus forming a global brain web.

40. In this chapter, I introduce the “global neuronal workspace” hypothesis, my laboratory’s fifteen-year effort to make sense of consciousness. The proposal is simple: consciousness is brain-wide information sharing. The human brain has developed efficient long-distance networks, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, to select relevant information and disseminate it throughout the brain. Consciousness is an evolved device that allows us to attend to a piece of information and keep it active within this broadcasting system. Once the information is conscious, it can be flexibly routed to other areas according to our current goals. Thus we can name it, evaluate it, memorize it, or use it to plan the future. Computer simulations of neural networks show that the global neuronal workspace hypothesis generates precisely the signatures that we see in experimental brain recordings. It can also explain why vast amounts of knowledge remain inaccessible to our consciousness.
   - Location: 2769-2776
   - Page: 181

41. According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. That’s because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it. As a result, we may use it in whatever way we please. In particular, we can dispatch it to our language processors and name it; this is why the capacity to report is a key feature of a conscious state. But we can also store it in long-term memory or use it for our future plans, whatever they are. The flexible dissemination of information, I argue, is a characteristic property of the conscious state.
   - Location: 2822-2827
   - Page: 184

42. However, conversely, any information that reaches the conscious workspace immediately becomes capable of regulating, in an extremely deep and extensive manner, all our thoughts. Executive attention is just one of the many systems that receive inputs from the global workspace. As a result, whatever we are aware of becomes available to drive our decisions and our intentional actions, giving rise to the feeling that they are “under control.” Language, long-term memory, attention, and intention systems are all part of this inner circle of intercommunicating devices that exchange conscious information. Thanks to this workspace architecture, whatever we are aware of can be arbitrarily rerouted and become the subject of a sentence, the crux of a memory, the focus of our attention, or the core of our next voluntary act.
   - Location: 2871-2876
   - Page: 188

43. Thanks to the global neuronal workspace, information can be shared freely across the modular processors of our brain. This global availability of information is precisely what we subjectively experience as a conscious state.13 The evolutionary advantages of this arrangement are obvious. Modularity is useful because different domains of knowledge require different tunings of the cortex: the circuits for navigating in space perform different operations than those that recognize a landscape or store a past event in memory. But decisions must often be based on the pooling of multiple sources of knowledge.
   - Location: 2891-2896

44. Relative to our primate cousins, our prefrontal neurons are more branched and contain more spines. Their dense jungle of dendrites is controlled by a family of genes that are uniquely mutated in humans.21 The list includes FoxP2, the famous gene with two mutations specific to the Homo lineage,22 which modulates our language networks,23 and whose disruption creates a massive impairment in articulation and speech.24 The FoxP2 family includes several genes responsible for building neurons, dendrites, axons, and synapses.
   - Location: 2966-2972
   - Page: 194

45. It is crucial to understand that, in this sort of coding scheme, the silent neurons, which do not fire, also encode information. Their muteness implicitly signals to others that their preferred feature is not present or is irrelevant to the current mental scene. A conscious content is defined just as much by its silent neurons as by its active ones.
   - Location: 3082-3084
   - Page: 201

46. The term subliminal applies to this category of situations where the incoming sensory wave dies out before creating a tsunami on the shores of the global neuronal workspace. However hard we try to perceive it, a subliminal stimulus will never become conscious, whereas a preconscious stimulus will, if only we find time to attend it. This is a key difference, with many consequences at the brain level.
   - Location: 3327-3330
   - Page: 217

47. The preconscious/subliminal distinction does not exhaust the stock of unconscious knowledge in our brains. Consider breathing. Every minute of your life, harmonious patterns of neural firing, generated deep in your brain stem and sent to your chest muscles, shape the ventilation rhythms that keep you alive. Ingenious feedback loops adapt them to the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. This sophisticated neuronal machinery remains totally unconscious. Why? Its neural firing is strong and extended in time, so it is not subliminal; yet no amount of attention can bring it to mind, so it is not preconscious either. Within our taxonomy, this case corresponds to a third category of unconscious representation: disconnected patterns.
   - Location: 3330-3335
   - Page: 218

48. Encapsulated in your brain stem, the firing patterns that control your breathing are disconnected from the global workspace system in prefrontal and parietal cortex. To become conscious, information inside a neural assembly has to be communicated to workspace neurons in the prefrontal cortex and associated sites. Respiration data, however, are forever locked in your brain stem neurons. The firing patterns that signal your blood CO2 level cannot be transmitted to the rest of your cortex. As a result, you remain unaware of them.
   - Location: 3335-3340
   - Page: 218

49. When we multiply 24 by 31, we are supremely conscious. Each intermediate operation, its nature and order, and even the occasional errors that we make are accessible to our introspection. When we process speech, by contrast, we remain paradoxically speechless about our internal processes. The problems cracked by our syntax processor are just as hard as arithmetic, but we are clueless as to how we solve them.
   - Location: 3397-3400
   - Page: 222

50. In thinking about free will, we therefore need to sharply distinguish two intuitions about our decisions: their fundamental indeterminacy (a dubious idea) and their autonomy (a respectable notion). Our brain states are clearly not uncaused and do not escape the laws of physics—nothing does. But our decisions are genuinely free whenever they are based on a conscious deliberation that proceeds autonomously, without any impediment, carefully weighting the pros and cons before committing to a course of action. When this occurs, we are correct in speaking of a voluntary decision—even if it is, of course, ultimately caused by our genes, our life history, and the value functions they have inscribed in our neuronal circuits. Because of fluctuations in spontaneous brain activity, our decisions may remain unpredictable, even to us. Yet this unpredictability is not a defining feature of free will; nor should it be confused with absolute indeterminacy. What counts is the autonomous decision making.
   - Location: 4587-4593
   - Page: 300

51. The richness of information processing that an evolved network of sixteen billion cortical neurons provides lies beyond our current imagination. Our neuronal states ceaselessly fluctuate in a partially autonomous manner, creating an inner world of personal thoughts. Even when confronted with identical sensory inputs, they react differently depending on our mood, goals, and memories. Our conscious neuronal codes also vary from brain to brain. Although we all share the same overall inventory of neurons coding for color, shape, or movement, their detailed organization results from a long developmental process that sculpts each of our brains differently, ceaselessly selecting and eliminating synapses to create our unique personalities. The neuronal code that results from this crossing of genetic rules, past experiences, and chance encounters is unique to each moment and to each person. Its immense number of states creates a rich world of inner representations, linked to the environment but not imposed by it. Subjective feelings of pain, beauty, lust, or regret correspond to stable neuronal attractors in this dynamic landscape. They are inherently subjective, because the dynamics of the brain embed its present inputs into a tapestry of past memories and future goals, thus adding a layer of personal experience to raw sensory inputs. What emerges is a “remembered present,”76 a personalized cipher of the here and now, thickened with lingering memories and anticipated forecasts, and constantly projecting a first-person perspective on its environment: a conscious inner world. This exquisite biological machinery is clicking right now inside your brain. As you close this book to ponder your own existence, ignited assemblies of neurons literally make up your mind.

## A Curious Mind: The Secret to a Bigger Life
**Author:** Brian Grazer;Charles Fishman

### Highlights (4)

1. For it to be effective, curiosity has to be harnessed to at least two other key traits. First, the ability to pay attention to the answers to your questions—you have to actually absorb whatever it is you’re being curious about. We all know people who ask really good questions, who seem engaged and energized when they’re talking and asking those questions, but who zone out the moment it’s time for you to answer. The second trait is the willingness to act.

3. If you have good taste, three things are true. First, you have the ability to judge the quality of something, whether it’s music or art, architecture or cooking, movies or books. Second, your sense of whether something is worthwhile is individual—you bring a perspective to your judgments. And third, there is also something universal about your judgments—your taste can be understood and appreciated by people who aren’t as experienced as you, whose sense of taste isn’t as well developed as yours. Your good taste is educated, it has a splash of individuality about it, and also a certain breadth of appeal.

## The Distracted Mind
**Author:** Adam Gazzaley;Larry D. Rosen

### Highlights (44)

1. In this book, we apply our complementary scientific lenses to present timely and practical insights. Dr. Adam Gazzaley is a cognitive neuroscientist and a trailblazer in the study of how the brain manages distractions and interruptions. Dr. Larry Rosen is a psychologist who has studied the “psychology of technology” as a pioneer in this field for more than thirty years. Our complementary perspectives focus on demonstrating why we fail to successfully navigate our modern technological ecosystem and how that has detrimentally affected our safety, cognition, education, workplace, and our relationships with family and friends.
   - Location: 129-134
   - Page: 9

2. We describe how the very essence of what has evolved furthest in our brains to make us human—our ability to set high-level goals for ourselves—collides headfirst with our brain’s fundamental limitations in cognitive control: attention, working memory, and goal management. This collision results in our extreme sensitivity to goal interference from both distractions by irrelevant information and interruptions by attempted multitasking. This noise degrades our perceptions, influences our language, hinders effective decision making, and derails our ability to capture and recall detailed memories of life events. The negative impact is even greater for those of us with undeveloped or impaired cognitive control, such as children, teens, and older adults as well as many clinical populations.

3. how the human brain has evolved to establish complex goals and implement them using a set of abilities known as cognitive control: attention, working memory, and goal management.
   - Location: 175-176
   - Page: 12

4. WE HAVE COME to believe that the human brain is a master navigator of the river of information that rages steadily all around us. And yet we often feel challenged when trying to fulfill even fairly simple goals. This is the result of interference—both distractions from irrelevant information and interruptions by our attempts to simultaneously pursue multiple goals.
   - Location: 184-188
   - Page: 12

5. Goal interference occurs when you reach a decision to accomplish a specific goal (e.g., retrieve something from the refrigerator, complete a work assignment, engage in a conversation, drive your car) and something takes place to hinder the successful completion of that goal. The interference can either be generated internally, presenting as thoughts within your mind, or generated externally, by sensory stimuli such as restaurant chatter, beeps, vibrations, or flashing visual displays (figure 1.1). Goal interference, originating from either your internal or external environments (often both), can occur in two distinct varieties—distractions and interruptions—based on your decision about how you manage the interference.1
   - Location: 231-238
   - Page: 16

6. Distractions are pieces of goal-irrelevant information that we either encounter in our external surroundings or generate internally within our own minds. When it comes to distractions, our intentions are very clear—we wish to ignore them, shut them out, suppress them, and carry on with attempting to accomplish our singular goal.
   - Location: 247-249
   - Page: 17

7. Interruptions are the other major source of goal interference. The difference from distractions is that interruptions happen when you make a decision to concurrently engage in more than one task at the same time, and even if you attempt to switch rapidly between them.
   - Location: 262-264
   - Page: 18

8. Interruptions such as these are often referred to as “multitasking,” defined as the act of attempting to engage simultaneously in two or more tasks that have independent goals. The word “attempting” is used here because, as you will see later in the book, multitasking may be the behavior you decide to engage in, but when it comes to what actually occurs in your brain, the term “task switching” is a better description.
   - Location: 272-275
   - Page: 18

9. What distinguishes distractions from interruptions are your intentions about how you choose to manage them; either you attempt to ignore them and carry on with your original goal—distraction—or you engage in them as a simultaneous, secondary goal—interruption. Despite both of these being types of goal interference, different brain mechanisms underlie the performance impairment they generate, as we will discuss later.
   - Location: 278-281
   - Page: 19

10. Our proficiency in setting goals is mediated by a collection of cognitive abilities that are widely known as “executive functions,” a set of skills that include evaluation, decision making, organization, and planning. But goal setting is only half the battle. We also need specialized processes to enact all those lofty goals. Our ability to effectively carry out our goals is dependent on an assemblage of related cognitive abilities that we will refer to throughout this book as “cognitive control.” This includes attention, working memory, and goal management.

12. shift in societal expectations such that we now demand immediate responsiveness and continuous productivity. Several studies have reported that US adults and teenagers check their phone up to 150 times a day, or every six to seven minutes that they are awake.9 Similar studies in the UK have found that more than half of all adults and two-thirds of young adults and teens do not go one hour without checking their phones. Furthermore, three in four smartphone owners in the US feel panicked when they cannot immediately locate their phone, half check it first thing in the morning while still lying in bed, one in three check it while using the bathroom, and three in ten check it while dining with others.
   - Location: 340-345
   - Page: 23

13. How can self-perpetuated interference-inducing behaviors be considered optimal from any perspective, when they are clearly detrimental to us in so many ways? The answer is that at our core we are information-seeking creatures, so behaviors that maximize information accumulation are optimal, at least from that viewpoint. This notion is supported by findings that molecular and physiological mechanisms that originally developed in our brain to support food foraging for survival have now evolved in primates to include information foraging.
   - Location: 378-383
   - Page: 25

14. But an even more profound evolutionary modification to the perception-action cycle was the evolution of a mechanism that “broke” the cycle, so that the relationship between input and output were no longer always automatic and reflexive. Although perception-action reflexes continue to offer us critical survival benefits, and are thus preserved at many levels of our nervous system, they now exert a diminished influence on our most complex behaviors. Indeed, it is this break in the perception-action cycle that created the golden opportunity for the evolution of goals, which are perhaps the defining unique characteristic of the human mind. This most remarkable milestone in our brain’s evolution, the insertion of a break in the perception-action cycle, can be conceptualized more appropriately as a time delay between perception and action—a pause. During this pause, highly evolved neural processes that underlie our goal-setting abilities come into play—the executive functions. These abilities of evaluation, decision making, organization, and planning disrupt the automaticity of the cycle and influence both perceptions and actions via associations, reflections, expectations, and emotional weighting. This synthesis is the true pinnacle of the human mind—the creation of high-level goals.5
   - Location: 520-531

15. Goals are internally generated plans that guide our actions, allowing us to choose how we respond to incoming perceptions based on evaluations that we engage in and decisions that we reach.

16. If a child pinches your arm, you will invariably recoil, fulfilling the pain-withdrawal reflex. But you are then unlikely to strike back. You are able to pause, engage in goal-setting processes, evaluate the act as nonmalicious and the young perpetrator as a nonthreat, to reach a decision that a violent response is unwarranted and inappropriate. This allows you to suppress retaliation, which in a less evolved creature might have been a reflexive counterstrike out of self-defense. As we will discuss later, the pause is not only one of the more recent evolutions of the human brain, but also the latest to develop in each of our lives. Children with underdeveloped goal-setting abilities often do strike back in this situation, much to the dismay of parents around the world.

17. These internal, goal-directed, top-down influences occur at the same time as external, stimulus-driven, bottom-up influences to modulate our perceptions and actions. The bottom-up forces are the same as they have always have been: novelty and saliency. Stimuli that are unexpected, dramatic, and sudden, such as a flash of light or a loud crash, or important, either innately or based on memories of previous experiences, such as your name, command bottom-up dominance in our minds, independent of our top-down goals.
   - Location: 551-556
   - Page: 36

18. The mediators of our top-down goals comprise another amazing collection of abilities that fall under the umbrella of cognitive control. This includes three major faculties: (1) attention, (2) working memory, and (3) goal management, each consisting of subcomponent processes. It is this battery of cognitive control abilities that allows us to interact in our complex world in a dynamic and goal-directed manner. And with varying degrees of success, it is what allows us to resist the negative impact of goal interference.

   - Location: 979-983
   - Page: 64

22. ATTENTION LIMITATIONS Selectivity Engaging our attention with the highest level of selectivity is critical for us to function effectively in the complex environments that we inhabit. Our brain simply does not have the infinite parallel processing resources needed to simultaneously receive and interpret all the information we are exposed to at every moment. And so, we need to rapidly fire our cognitive resources at targets selected to be most relevant to our goals. Simultaneously, we must block out the vast, rapidly changing stream of goal-irrelevant information that flows around us.
   - Location: 1289-1294
   - Page: 85

23. As described, this earliest form of selectivity is known as bottom-up processing, sometimes considered itself to be a form of attention—although not one based on top-down goals, but rather driven by stimulus properties themselves. This ancient form of attention served as the earliest fuel of the perception-action cycle, and it remains deeply rooted in our modern brains.
   - Location: 1300-1302
   - Page: 85

24. Despite its necessity, when attentional selectivity is viewed from the perspective of being a core cognitive control ability that enables us to enact our goals, retained sensitivity to bottom-up influences represents a serious limitation. It is a remnant of our ancient brains and a major challenge to any selectivity mechanism whose core function is to filter out everything that is not in the crosshairs of our goals. Those stimuli with the strongest bottom-up factors of novelty and salience are the most formidable at involuntarily usurping our attention from our goals; they are the source of external distraction and a major aspect of goal interference.
   - Location: 1311-1315
   - Page: 86

25. selectivity depends as much on neural processes involved in ignoring goal-irrelevant information as it does on processes that facilitate the focus on goal-relevant information. This relationship between focus and ignore has been described as a “biased competition,” or a push-pull battle between top-down and bottom-up processes.
   - Location: 1317-1320
   - Page: 86

26. Just imagine focusing your attention selectively on a conversation you are having in a noisy restaurant. All the while, even despite your lack of awareness, an internal competition is raging to resist the source of goal interference. Then an altercation erupts at the next table. Undoubtedly, this bottom-up influence will win the attention battle despite your goals of ignoring everything except the conversation. Our attentional selectivity is limited; we don’t always get to fire our cognitive arrows precisely where we want without interference.

28. We experience costs even when we explicitly decide to switch between tasks. This is true even for simple tasks, as long as they demand some degree of cognitive control. You can observe this for yourself. Try the following exercise: First count from one to ten out loud. Then recite the alphabet from A to J out loud. Those two tasks should be quite easy. But now try combining them by rapidly switching between them: recite A1, B2, C3, and so forth out loud. You will likely sense the limitations imposed by the network switching that is required to do this, as well as notice the cost of being slower—perhaps even making an error or two if you push yourself to perform this rapidly.

29. Here is a summary of the limitations described throughout the chapter. Attention 1. Selectivity is limited by susceptibility to bottom-up influences. 2. Distribution of attention results in diminished performance compared to focused attention. 3. Sustainability of attention over time is limited, especially in extended, boring situations. 4. Processing speed limitations affect both the efficiency of allocation and withdrawal of attention. Working Memory 1. Capacity, or the number of items that can be actively held in mind, is severely limited. 2. Fidelity, the quality of information maintained in working memory, decays over time and as a result of interference. Goal Management 1. Multitasking is limited by our inability to effectively parallel process two attention-demanding tasks. 2. Task switching results in costs to accuracy and speed performance.

30. understanding the neural basis of this attentional selectivity deficit. In one study that used the face/scene experiment described in chapter 3, we challenged the selective attention of older research participants by having them view a sequence of four images (two faces and two scenes) and asking them to remember the stimuli from only one category for a brief period of time while ignoring the stimuli from the other category (e.g., remember faces and ignore scenes). As described, young adults show both enhancement and suppression of neural activity in the visual cortex in response to the relevant and irrelevant images, respectively. This bidirectional nature of top-down modulation of neural activity is at the core of attentional selectivity. Our main finding in this study was that, interestingly, older adults enhance activity for relevant information as well as twenty-year-olds. Where older adults suffered a deficit was in suppressing the irrelevant information. Thus, we discovered that their main attentional issue was that they are more distractible than younger adults.13 The Gazzaley Lab published the results of this study as evidence that selectivity impairments in older adults were the result of a neural deficit in the mechanisms responsible for goal-directed, top-down suppression. Even though our older research participants were aware of the instructions to ignore the irrelevant information, we did not see evidence in their brains that they were effectively suppressing the processing of those stimuli. We went on to show the functional significance of this deficit by demonstrating that those older adults who exhibited poorer suppression of distractors also did more poorly on the working memory test.14 Note that this reduced performance is occurring in the context of a preserved ability to focus on relevant information. This is further evidence that the processes that underlie focusing and ignoring are not two sides of the same coin. Older adults have impairments in suppression, but not enhancement, and this is the deficit that is related to their diminished working memory performance.
   - Location: 1687-1704
   - Page: 111

31. There is a growing consensus of research studies that support the conclusion that attentional deficiencies in selectivity are not the consequence of an inability of older adults to focus on their goals, but rather are the consequence of a selective deficit in ignoring distractions.
   - Location: 1707-1710
   - Page: 112

32. We have recently shown that this selectivity deficit is associated with age-related alterations in prefrontal cortex networks; and not just functional changes, but also structural changes in the volume of a region in the middle part of the prefrontal cortex, as well as diminished integrity of the white matter that connect this area with other brain structures. We also found that older adults with these brain changes were more distractible on a working memory test.16

33. Part I of this book has focused on understanding the Distracted Mind in terms of what is going on in our brains that has created our interference dilemma. We have shown how our brains, despite their highly evolved goal-setting abilities, are ancient in some fundamental ways: our information-seeking behavior is an extension of primitive food-foraging behaviors, and our limitations in cognitive control are comparable to that of many other animals. It is our high-level goal-setting abilities, coupled with our drive to seek information, that lead us to engage in interference-inducing behaviors that put pressure on those limitations in our cognitive control. This conflict results in goal interference, which in turn leads to a broad array of negative consequences that we experience in our daily lives. But cognitive abilities are not the only factors that influence real-world behavior. Behavior is contextual; it is a product of not just how we think, but also what is going on around us. Our environment interacts with our cognition in complex ways to yield our behavior. In Part II, we build on the foundation we have created to show how modern technology aggravates the Distracted Mind and affects the quality of our lives in unexpected ways.

34. Cell-phone-related accidents can happen for a variety of reasons, including taking one’s hands off the steering wheel, taking one’s eyes off the road, or withdrawing one’s attention. Given that research shows that the incidence of accidents with handsfree phones and handheld phones are equivalent, it is likely that the primary cause is neither physical nor visual but rather an issue of attention—one of our major cognitive control abilities with distinct limitations.29 Despite this, handsfree cell phone use is still legal in every state.

35. To sum up, the research done in the workplace suggests that we are trying to cram too many tasks into too short a time because we respond as though an alert—usually about an incoming communication—is a command to drop whatever we are doing and reorient our attention to a new patch of information. In addition, while we are usually able to accomplish this (and even faster, according to Gloria Mark’s work), we pay a huge price in terms of anxiety and stress. It is important to point out that none of the research studies that examined workplace interruptions dealt with the addition of the smartphone to our vast array of desktop technology. The bottom line is that being constantly interrupted and having to spend extra time to remember what we were doing has a negative impact on workplace productivity and quality of life. One 2005 study—before the major increase in smartphone usage—estimated that when office workers are interrupted as often as eleven times an hour it costs the United States $558 billion per year.43

36. our relationship with technology has spawned a variety of “conditions” that include phantom pocket vibration syndrome, FOMO (fear of missing out), and nomophobia (fear of being out of mobile phone contact), all of which are centered on a need to be connected constantly. Phantom vibrations are an interesting phenomenon. A mere ten years ago, if you felt a tingling near your pants pocket you would reach down and scratch the area to relieve the presumed itch. Now the very same neuronal activity promotes a need for us to check our smartphone—sometimes even if we are not carrying one in our pocket at the time—as it is assumed that our phone just vibrated, signaling an incoming alert or notification.

37. What information consumes is rather obvious: It consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. —NOBEL PRIZE–WINNING ECONOMIST HERBERT SIMON1

38. John Eastwood and his colleagues at York University suggest in their work that boredom is “the aversive experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity.”5 Eastwood and his colleagues go further in clarifying boredom as an aversive state that occurs when we • are not able to successfully engage attention with internal (e.g., thoughts or feelings) or external (e.g., environmental stimuli) information required for participating in satisfying activity, • are focused on the fact that we are not able to engage attention and participate in satisfying activity, and • attribute the cause of our aversive state to the environment. Eastwood further clarifies that a bored person is not just one who has nothing to do; rather, he or she wants to be stimulated and is unable to be. He calls it having an “unengaged mind.”

39. We see that the impact of boredom is not just to make us switch between information patches; we also seem to have lost the ability to simply do nothing and endure boredom. This leaves little time for reflection, deep thinking, or even just simply sitting back and letting our random thoughts drive us places we might not have gone while immersed in directed thinking.

41. While learning factual knowledge and acquiring practical skills are both important, the development of basic cognitive control abilities is essential. There is convincing evidence that superior cognitive control is associated with successful academic performance, but little is known about the reverse; that is, does traditional education actually build the fundamental information-processing abilities of our brains that underlie cognitive control?5

43. Hopefully, the content presented in Parts I and II helped you to truly understand not just how dangerous driving while distracted and multitasking is—that “text messaging creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted,”5 that using a cell phone increases your chance of being in an accident as much as being legally drunk—but also why we are so vulnerable to it, and why it’s so hard for us to stop. If you still think you’re a master of multitasking or just want to experience for yourself how detrimental texting and driving is, there are several online simulators where you can take a spin.6 Virtually experiencing the severe consequences of texting and driving may be enough to help us change our metacognition about our abilities. The research on texting and driving is so clear that all but six states have banned it.7 In contrast, while fourteen states have banned using handheld phones for all drivers, none have included a ban on all cell phone calls despite research demonstrating that handsfree cell phone use also increases the risk of accidents.8 This illustrates the pervasiveness of our poor metacognition. The bottom line is that as soon as drivers remove their attention from the road to do anything other than drive it induces risk, and we all need to be very aware of this.

44. The simplest way to remove the temptation to text or talk on your mobile phone while driving is to put your phone in the trunk (with Bluetooth off). There are also several apps available now that block texting and making phone calls while driving. Some, such as DriveOFF and DriveMode, are based on speed: once you are traveling at more than a slow speed, the app blocks your ability to text, displays a static screen saver, or reminds you not to text (which may be distracting, in and of itself). Additional apps are available to curtail cell phone distractions and interruptions including Live2Txt, TxtShield, SafeDrive, and LifeSaver. In addition, if you are a parent of a driving child—and we know how scary that can be—there are apps that will monitor tech activities while your teen is driving including Canary and DriveSafeMode. And by the time this book is in print there will surely be dozens more apps, so consult your app store. If this is too extreme for you, give your phone to a passenger when you are driving and let him or her respond if needed.

3. tension between maintaining beliefs and injecting new ideas is a profound issue for any complex information-processing system, be it proto–life-forms, the neural interactions in our brains, or the scientific enterprise as a whole. Usually, though, a Goldilocks middle state, with chaos on one side and utter stability on the other, is the optimal way for any system to process information, and especially to learn useful new details about the world. This semi-chaotic activity is found whenever efficient information processing is required. It is probably the default state for networks of neurons, and it is one explanation for how complex thoughts in the human mind emerge from neuronal chatter. A similar optimal balance between order and chaos exists in the scientific enterprise. There are cases, particularly in the softer sciences, where a prominent professor with a large ego—and a history of drawing in a large amount of grant money based on his well-established ideas—will do all he can to maintain these theories, including engaging in practices that are essentially unscientific and dogmatic. He may bend the rules to publish papers confirming his results, ignore experiments his lab carries out that contradict them, insist that his lab tow the party line, that those working under him always believe in his theory absolutely, and so on. He and his scientific progeny, his PhD students and postdoctoral assistants, may well be maintaining this viewpoint in the face of increasing evidence opposing it. For a while, due to his influence and personality, his theory may continue to flourish, but eventually it will be superseded, and his research staff will find it increasingly difficult to grab decent academic posts because of their long-standing defense of a scientific position shown to be wrong. In a separate category are scientists who constantly generate outlandish ideas but are not particularly interested in testing them with carefully controlled experiments. Admittedly these rarely get past the PhD stage, but if they do, their careers always seem hampered by their overactive creativity. The best scientists not only have the most respectable careers but also leave a lasting legacy of work, along with a new set of high flyers, who were former students. These renowned scientists are skilled at establishing successful theories and empirical results. But they are also quick to ditch these theories when the evidence racks up against them. They then generate new ways of perceiving the field—always with a qualified creativity.

4. I will elaborate throughout this book that this drive to innovate your way out of a problem is a crucial feature of consciousness, whereas, in contrast, an important role of unconscious, habitual plans is to implement those fully learned products of the initially conscious innovations.

5. Although viral injections of DNA code are extremely common in bacteria, the human genome is also positively littered with viral material—as much as 50 percent of our genome consists of scars from ancient viruses burning their way into our code. But it’s also clear that some of these invasions have dramatically helped us, either by transporting useful results from other species or by shaking up our own code to give the possibility of new traits: For instance, one such viral donation of DNA is thought to have been responsible for the creation of the placenta in early mammals.

6. Our temperature is regulated in the limbic system, and our biological clocks tick away via rhythmic neurons in these limbic nuclei. Our primitive emotions, such as rage and fear, are generated here, as are our instinctive reactions to fight or to flee. One interesting hint of the age of this region can be found in the kind of phobias we as humans tend to have. Despite the thousands of deaths every year from car accidents, how many people do you know who are terrified of a Ford pickup? And yet, spider bites almost never cause fatalities anymore, but you almost certainly know someone (maybe even yourself) who just can’t bear creepy crawlies. The simple reason for this is that millions of years ago, spiders really were serious threats to life. Again, evolution can sometimes be very lazy about updating.

7. One special region to mention within this class of intermediate brain structures is the thalamus. This is effectively a relay station, the Grand Central Station of brain regions. It connects virtually all parts of the brain together. With damage to certain parts of it, but with everything else intact, a person will enter a vegetative state and show very little sign of consciousness. The thalamus is an important structure to support our experiences, possibly by allowing information to flow smoothly across every corner of the brain.

8. Just how limited is our unconscious mind, when applying these simple neuronal calculations? If you tell a patient recovering from an operation to complete the partial word “ash,” she may be equally likely to say “ashcan” or “ashtray.” But if you repeated the word “ashtray” when she was deeply unconscious, she will in fact be more likely to say “ashtray” in recovery. She will have absolutely no knowledge that she has just heard the word “ashtray” an hour or so ago; nevertheless, some part of her brain will remember. Some family of neurons has been tweaked to reflect this recognition, and she will respond accordingly. In other words, she has been “primed” to repeat a word to which she has already been exposed. Examples like this show that at some very superficial, unconscious level at least, words can be noticed. But there are multiple features of a word—for instance, there’s the sound, the grammatical features, the linguistic relationship a word has to others in various ways, and there’s also the meaning of the word. Meaning is the first main level at which our minds structure information, since meaning requires relationships between items in a dense web, hierarchies of categories, and so on. In this way, meaning is an especially pertinent test for the argument that consciousness is equated not only with information processing, but especially with structured information. Can patients be primed for the meaning of the word as well as the sound? For instance, if asked after the operation to complete the same partial word “ash,” are patients more likely to say “ashtray” instead of “ashcan” if they were exposed during the operation to the word “cigarette”? If so, this would mean there had been a deeper triggering of activity, so that the neuronal population had spread from the sound of the word to activating any neurons coding for a related meaning. This is precisely what some researchers tested, and it turns out that, when under a sufficiently deep anesthesia, this form of learning is beyond us. So, when profoundly unconscious, as happens under deep levels of general anesthesia, we can faintly learn under the radar of our consciousness that a certain word has just been presented to us, but that’s about the limit of it. Anything remotely more complex, such as a word’s meaning, is beyond our unconscious selves and requires at least some level of awareness. And, of course, for anything that we are actually conscious of learning—creating a strategy, memorizing a list, learning from instructions, or any of the myriad forms of information we manipulate every day—consciousness is certainly required.

10. So when the pigeon twirls around for food, that is potentially a marker of minimal consciousness, and when a human believes in astrology, that is actually, strangely, a solid indication of a substantive form of consciousness—no other type of animal could have such a spectacularly irrational schema as astrology, and there is also no chance for our simplistic unconscious minds to generate these intricate, rich false theories. Such elaborate failures as astrology, or, more pathologically, conditions like schizophrenia, are perhaps the price we pay for our exceptional consciousness, our deep hunger for wisdom, and our incredibly successful ability to detect profound real patterns, greatly furthering science and technology in the process.

11. The Israeli Nobel laureate in economics and psychologist Daniel Kahneman knows better than most just how many complex, potentially competing sources can, under the surface, contribute to any eventual decision. When he was a Jewish boy of around seven years old in Nazi-occupied France, he once was distracted playing with a Christian friend and accidentally stayed out past the 6 p.m. curfew for Jews. Turning his sweater inside out to hide his Star of David, he began to walk home quickly. Then he saw a soldier approach—and not just any soldier. This soldier was wearing the ominous black uniform of the SS, the notorious Nazi paramilitary force that carried out many of the atrocities of the Holocaust. And he was staring intently at the young Daniel, who was speeding up to try to walk past him—but in vain. The SS soldier beckoned the boy over, but instead of subjecting him to the fate of other Jews who had broken the curfew, he picked the boy up affectionately, hugged him, and spoke warmly to him in German, completely failing to notice the thick Jewish symbol on the inside of his sweater. He showed the boy a picture in his wallet of his own son, and even, in an ultimate act of irony, gave this Jewish boy some money to help him on his way. This event firmly placed Kahneman on the path of psychology as he sought to understand the many sources of our choices.

12. All of this indicates that consciousness might well be designed to make those big innovations, and uncover those deep patterns to the world, but that it is, by default, more a slave to our decisions than its master. Biologically, we are built to survive and reproduce, and the unconscious part of our brains does all it can to steer us toward these simple goals, with our conscious minds usually just a superlative servant of those unconscious aims.

13. attention is closely related to awareness: What I attend to is what I’m conscious of, and whatever falls outside of my attention is processed, if at all, by my unconscious mind alone.
   - Location: 2151-2152

14. Although so far I’ve talked about how attention acts as a filtering and boosting mechanism, I haven’t yet shown just how aggressively the brain can filter its input, or how intensely it can boost certain input signals. In fact, routinely, attention filters the billions of pieces of information streaming into our senses, or bouncing around our unconscious minds, into a maximum of three or four conscious items. So the filtering process is about as aggressive as one could imagine. But the boosting process can compensate for this limitation just as aggressively: Each of the mere handful of items can be an immensely complex mental object, and although their number is painfully finite, these conscious objects can be assessed, compared, and manipulated in virtually any way imaginable. This tiny, yet ever so powerful output store of attention is our “working memory.” Working memory is an inherently conscious short-term memory container where we can remember, rearrange, and evaluate whatever is in this group of items, even if it comes from different senses or categories.
   - Location: 2568-2575
   - Page: 168

15. Over the past twenty years, the most prevalent, popular psychological theory of consciousness has been the “global workspace theory” proposed by Bernard Baars. In many ways, Baars’ ideas resemble mainstream views on the psychology of attention. In the global workspace theory, there is again an unconscious fight for dominance between low-level coalitions of neurons, with a winner-takes-all attitude. The winner filters into consciousness, where again Baars makes more parallels with attention, by talking of a spotlight directed onto only a small portion of a theater stage. This spotlight is the subset of our world that we are actually conscious of, and it broadcasts itself to the whole audience, in other words, making just a small number of items available to much of the brain, potentially for further information combination and comparison. But Baars’ most bold and interesting claim is that, more or less, consciousness boils down to the information sitting right now in our working memory. He views working memory as existing for a second or two, available to almost every corner of the brain, and there to guide unconscious specialized knowledge regions to help us carry out our most complex tasks, such as language and planning. Although there are ambiguities in the definition of “working memory,” in the main I firmly agree with Baars that consciousness and working memory are largely synonymous processes, and that attention is the critical means by which items enter into consciousness. But the next key step, from the point of view of consciousness, is to fill in the details, to describe exactly how working memory functions, both psychologically and in the brain.

16. Surprisingly, our working memory limit of a handful of items is basically the same as the monkey’s, even though a monkey brain is about one-fifteenth the size of ours. And our closely related skill of being able to recognize the number of items briefly presented to us—about 3 or 4 again, before we need to start approximating—is the same capacity limit that newborns have. In fact, many other species have the same upper bound to immediately counting the number of objects, including the lowly honeybee, which can differentiate patterns containing 2 from 3 items, or 3 from 4, but not 4 from 5 or above. So there may be something fundamentally limited about just how many items all animals can store in short-term memory.
   - Location: 2615-2620
   - Page: 171

17. Turning first to the role that attention plays in boosting our capacity per working memory holder: Once attention has decided to prioritize a given object, whatever it may be, the neuronal war has been won. Activity in much of the brain is then shaped according to this current object and how it relates to us. For basic objects or features in the world, such as the color red as painted on a plain wall, attention boosts the signal by enhancing the readiness to fire of our visual regions, especially those for red. Non-red color-coding neurons may be suppressed, not only in our color-processing centers, but everywhere else as well. Our hearing and taste centers, for instance, may be inhibited. At the same time, all general-purpose regions, especially the prefrontal and parietal cortices, which are closely connected to consciousness, have activity that hones in on this current feature.
   - Location: 2626-2632
   - Page: 172

18. If, instead of the red wall, the current object of attention is Angelina Jolie on the big screen in front of me wearing a red dress, then anything around me that’s not Angelina Jolie gets suppressed, and any corner of my brain with any relevant information about Angelina Jolie becomes activated. As soon as I see her, I recognize the features of her face, I know her name, recall how she speaks, have knowledge of her famous husband that I can easily retrieve, remember the other films she’s been in, and so on. And, of course, I can also see that she’s wearing red. These aren’t sets of unrelated facts; they are all bound together as a single, unified, complex object. The previous example of the plain wall as an attended single object effectively had red as the only feature. When I attend to Angelina Jolie, the same piece of information, red, is attached to my conscious representation of her, but this time red is only one of dozens of features connected to this single mental object. This is a fantastic system to have—attention takes this raw input and seamlessly transforms it into a panoply of interconnected facts by the time it reaches consciousness. And yet, because attention has activated and drawn together all the components of this one object, Angelina Jolie, it takes up the same single compartment in my working memory as does the plain red wall.

19. consciousness boils down to an attention-gated working memory, with up to four chunks making up its contents.

20. Gazing up at the sky without any knowledge of star charts is akin to seeing the whole collection of stars as one fuzzy, complex object. If we want to remember things better, if we want to start seeing groups of stars, and memorize their relationship to each other, then—guess what?—we develop chunks to help us. I recognize the Plough because it looks like a deep frying pan with a wonky handle. And that constellation is Leo, a proud lion resting on the savannah. Without these chunks of stars, linked to well-known objects in memory, we’d have struggled to recognize any astral features, and historically this would have been a disaster for both navigation and agriculture. There is strong experimental confirmation of this sense that the more we see, the less we actually take in of each object.
   - Location: 2711-2717
   - Page: 177

21. Our sense of gist reflects the fact that attention has two clear stages: The first, meager, less interesting stage of attention, and indeed awareness, is where we get a weak sense of everything around us, as if we’re not really attending to anything—or rather, we are attending to everything in the same minimal way. This lasts for about 200 milliseconds. A short time later, though, the second form of attention kicks in, which is goal driven. Our neuronal landscape shapes itself according to the task at hand, and we start to hone in on interesting details—there’s

22. When we grasp the gist of a scene, imperfect as it is, nevertheless at least some attention has to be involved.
   - Location: 2743-2743
   - Page: 179

23. So attention is certainly a necessary gating component of consciousness, and while full consciousness of some detail means it has to be strongly attentionally favored as it firmly enters our limited working memory, the same working memory holder can weakly store an approximate group of items that we are faintly conscious of.
   - Location: 2752-2755
   - Page: 180

24. There are three straightforward sides to chunking processes—the search for chunks, the noticing and memorizing of those chunks, and the use of the chunks we’ve already built up. The main purpose of consciousness is to search for and discover these structured chunks of information within working memory, so that they can then be used efficiently and automatically, with minimal further input from consciousness.
   - Location: 2768-2771

25. When describing what I do to those outside of research, I regularly find the most useful analogy is that science is like trying to solve a huge, fuzzy crossword puzzle.
   - Location: 2796-2797
   - Page: 183

26. The initial stages of learning are always the hardest, but once the first foundations are built, we can connect new items with what we’ve already memorized; as the tapestry of knowledge builds, it becomes ever easier to learn a new part of a topic, because it increasingly connects to related memory items. Closely connected individual items form chunks together, which then connect up themselves in ever larger bound objects in memory. In this way, we can use consciousness—and chunking—to create a highly functional, hierarchical, interrelated bank of knowledge, where, by the time we reach adulthood, most seemingly novel items have some preexisting context. And these heavily embedded prior expectations from the fruits of our vast learning can in turn heavily guide our attention to decide what to load into our working memory, furthering our chances to discover in awareness something novel or important by which to incrementally improve our world model.
   - Location: 2835-2842
   - Page: 185

27. So, chunking within working memory is both the arbiter and the indexer of our long-term memory store, always striving to make what’s most important to us most easily accessible, and to forge new groups out of apparently independent items, based on the patterns we discern. Consciousness and chunking allow us to turn the dull sludge of independent episodes in our lives into a shimmering, dense web, interlinked by all the myriad patterns we spot. It becomes a positive feedback loop, making the detection of new connections even easier, and creates a domain ripe for understanding how things actually work, of reaching that supremely powerful realm of discerning the mechanism of things. At the same time, our memory system becomes far more efficient, effective—and intelligent—than it could ever be without such refined methods to extract useful structure from raw data.
   - Location: 2842-2848
   - Page: 186

28. The third and final aspect of chunking in relation to consciousness is what we do with those chunks when we’ve firmly acquired them. In this case, it’s generally better if we’re not aware of them—at least not anything other than the absolute top-level chunk we’re currently dealing with. The main purpose of awareness is either to manage tasks too new or complex for our simpler unconscious mind or to innovate, to find patterns in our working memory, so that we can optimize and automate biologically relevant goals. But once those tasks have been heavily learned, if they take up consciousness again, then that is far from ideal. First, because we are simultaneously analyzing the details of the task, we are likely to perform it less efficiently than when it was an automatic habit. Then there is the issue of energy use: Consciousness requires a large and active network of cortical regions, which in turn need considerably more energy than unconscious, automatic habits. So it is wasteful to use consciousness for anything other than its official purpose, to discover potentially significant opportunities to improve our mental programming.

29. one woman was born with almost no cerebellum in either hemisphere, but she was able to lead a relatively normal life, holding down a job at an electronics factory. So certainly not all brain areas equally contribute to consciousness. The above example also partially answers another question from the list—about consciousness simply relating to number of neurons. If neuron count equated to levels of awareness, then the cerebellum, with perhaps 80 percent of the entire brain’s neurons, would be the most conscious part. That clearly isn’t the case.
   - Location: 3018-3022
   - Page: 197

30. the most critical region for consciousness is also one of the smallest and—in some ways—the least interesting, for the purposes of this book. This brain area is known as the reticular formation. It is part of the brain stem, the most primitive of brain regions and another component of the reptilian brain. The reticular formation controls the sleep-wake cycle through a complex set of subregions that each play a part in a chemical and neuronal cascade of activity. These actions allow us both to wake up and to enter different modes of sleep. For instance, when we dream, it is the reticular formation that pushes signals down to the spinal cord, actively paralyzing the rest of the body so that we don’t start actually crashing into walls when we’re dreaming we’re running around. Damage to the reticular formation is usually a pretty absolute business. Either the patient will die or he will be totally robbed of consciousness in a deep coma, unable to ever wake up. But while we definitely need our reticular formation in order to be aware, it doesn’t follow that our consciousness actually occurs in this primitive brain area. My PC will simply not turn on without the power supply unit, but this box is the dumbest part of my computer, having nothing to do with the processing that gives me a functioning operating system.
   - Location: 3022-3031
   - Page: 198

31. Patients with extensive damage to the thalamus tend to enter a so-called vegetative state. This is distinguished from coma in that vegetative patients show signs of wakefulness—they may open their eyes more in the daytime, for instance. It’s as if their reticular formation is still partially carrying out its duty of waking up the brain, but there isn’t enough neural coherence for them actually to be aware of anything when they are awake.
   - Location: 3039-3042
   - Page: 199

32. Along with helping with the flow of information between most regions of the brain, the thalamus helps to point our attention in various directions. This explains how those in a vegetative state with damage to their thalamus can appear to be awake, but lack any directed consciousness. Imagine a life where you were alert in some sense, but your attention was never directed toward any object, any goal, any thought—would we even call such a state conscious?

33. Patients who have extensive damage to both sides of the top portion of their posterior parietal cortex have a rare condition known as Bálint’s syndrome, which completely knocks out their sense of space. Their experience of the spatial extent of the entire outside world seems to disappear, and patients report that “there is no there, there.” One feature of this syndrome is that patients are unable to perceive more than one object at a time. Even with this single object, they cannot locate it, nor can they tell if it’s moving toward or away from them. If they are looking at a crowded scene of multiple objects, once they recognize one object the others will become invisible. Sometimes, even perception of a single object is impaired. One patient, known as KE, could recognize colors and read words, but couldn’t do both—so if he read a word, he was unable to identify its color.

34. But if you lose both prefrontal cortices, what happens? Such cases are rare, possibly because the patient is far too ill to take part in any scientific research. But one neurologist, Bob Knight, has come across such a patient. The patient was awake, but otherwise looked disturbingly like a zombie. He had no motivation of his own, just constantly sat immobile in a chair as he stared into space, and tragically, it seemed as if any meaningful awareness was totally absent.

35. what is the consensus from brain-scanning studies exploring the role of the prefrontal parietal network? The main thrust of the research has indeed centered on working memory and attention, with the prefrontal parietal network closely associated with both.

36. In fact, as this is our most abstract, higher-order brain network, a common finding is that these areas are activated whenever we perform a complex or novel form of any task whatsoever, whether it involves short-term memory, long-term memory, mental arithmetic, or any other potentially challenging cognitive process. For this reason, these regions are also most closely linked with IQ.

37. If you read a psychology textbook, even now, it will probably make neat distinctions between working memory, attention, long-term memory, mental arithmetic, reasoning, and so on, as though these were all independent processes. Increasingly, though, researchers are eroding the spaces between almost all types of thought and memory, and building broad links between them. Aside from the fact that all such thoughts will activate the prefrontal parietal network, there are many other connections. For instance, it’s clear that working memory is intimately linked with attention, with working memory effectively

38. If you read a psychology textbook, even now, it will probably make neat distinctions between working memory, attention, long-term memory, mental arithmetic, reasoning, and so on, as though these were all independent processes. Increasingly, though, researchers are eroding the spaces between almost all types of thought and memory, and building broad links between them. Aside from the fact that all such thoughts will activate the prefrontal parietal network, there are many other connections. For instance, it’s clear that working memory is intimately linked with attention, with working memory effectively being the output of attentional filtering.

40. The model most closely aligned with the existing data, and the view of consciousness I’ve been describing throughout this book, is the global neuronal workspace model proposed by Stanislas Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux. This model is largely the neuronal extension of the global workspace theory put forward by Bernard Baars. In Baars’ theory, consciousness is roughly equated with working memory. It’s a spotlight on a stage, or scribbles on a general-purpose cognitive white board, which lasts only a second or two, but which can contain and manipulate working memory items by drawing them from our vast unconscious reservoirs of knowledge in specialist nonconscious systems.

41. The third and final theory, Giulio Tononi’s information integration theory, travels in the opposite direction, only discussing mechanisms while refusing to get its hands dirty with too many tawdry details about the brain. Information integration theory is also by far the most abstract and ambitious of the current crop of consciousness models.24 An entirely mathematical theory, it tries to distill consciousness into its informational essence. Whereas the previous two models were rooted in the real cortical networks of the human brain, Tononi’s theory applies to any network of nodes whatsoever, be they a connected series of neurons, computer transistors, or any other information-carrying object one would care to imagine. For Tononi, a network’s capacity for consciousness is directly related to how many different kinds of information it can represent and how well those pieces of information can be combined. The more nodes there are in a network—as long as they are sufficiently connected to each other—the more varied the possibilities for combined forms of information and the greater that network’s capacity for consciousness.

42. In fact, a common drawback of all the neural theories of consciousness, one way or another, is that they tend to focus on mathematical or neurophysiological details while somewhat neglecting the psychological components that make up consciousness. In my view, the next iteration of these models will need to place attention as a key ingredient in the recipe for consciousness, rather than assume it is a separate process, as many scientists currently seem to do. And if they include working memory at all (at present only the global neuronal workspace theory does), then they should flesh out the details of this—such as including chunking processes as a fundamental component and explaining just how our consciousness is so ripe for innovative thoughts.

43. the octopus brain is decidedly unusual, with an exceptionally parallel architecture—almost always a positive quality when you are talking about brains. The majority of octopus neurons are to be found not in its brain, but in its arms. In effect, if you include the neuronal bundles in its limbs, the octopus has nine semi-independent brains, making it unique in the animal kingdom. The octopus is also a genius among ocean creatures. It has highly developed memory and attentional systems. In nature, this allows these invertebrates to take on a wide range of shapes to mimic other animals, rocks, or even plants. In the lab, octopuses can distinguish shapes and colors, navigate through a maze, open a jar with a screw-on lid, and even learn by observing the behavior of another octopus—an ability thought previously only to exist in highly social animals.

44. Giulio Tononi, along with his colleague Marcello Massimini, has already been developing an intriguing method by which to make a practical rough-and-ready approximation. The experiment uses EEG to record brain waves as well as a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) machine. TMS involves a figure-eight device about the size of a small book that is placed on the scalp. This machine is in fact a powerful electromagnet. The magnet is turned on for a fraction of a second, which causes the cortical neurons under the scalp, at the center of the figure-of-eight coil, to fire. All that the subject feels (I’ve experienced TMS myself multiple times) is a kind of tap on the head. In this particular experiment, the only task the volunteers had to perform was to nod off while the TMS pulses were delivered every couple of seconds. If the subjects were awake, the TMS would cause a spike of brain waves that would spread almost all over the brain during the next few hundred milliseconds or so. When the subjects drifted off to a dreamless sleep, although the initial spike of activity was greater, it would die down faster, and would remain only at the local site that was stimulated by the TMS machine. This study shows firsthand how, in wakefulness, information can flow freely across our entire cortical surface, but when we’re asleep, although the neurons are just as capable of firing, they only weakly transmit their information to their nearest neighbors. Massimini and Tononi see this as evidence that our ability to combine information throughout much of the cortex is high when we’re awake, but low when asleep (these data are also applicable to other consciousness theories, however). Although at present this method can do little more than distinguish between wakefulness and sleep, plans are afoot to turn it into a far more sensitive measure. Massimini and his group are starting to use the complexity in the EEG wave, rather than how far it travels and for how long, as a more accurate way of gauging level of consciousness. Soon one of these techniques may be able to generate a practical index of consciousness. This quantification of the level of awareness could be applied to any normal subject, whether awake or asleep, as well as any patient, or indeed many animals.

45. In ethics, a broad distinction is often made between two very different frameworks: The first is a rights-based system, with laws against murder and theft being obvious examples. The second type of ethical mechanism, in contrast, centers only on a calculation of the net pleasure and suffering of a given population. Economics and its obsession with money would be a rough approximation to this second stance.

46. In the scientific thesis that I have defended here, consciousness is most closely aligned with innovation. Tool invention and use, which require innovative, flexible thoughts, are therefore strong indicators of an extensive consciousness. This would class not just our great ape cousins, but also, at the very least, monkeys, corvids, dolphins, and octopuses as creatures that deserve protection under our laws. Experiments have additionally shown that various nonhuman species can master self-recognition in a mirror and demonstrate self-doubt. Given that we’d automatically take these skills as evidence of a rich form of consciousness in ourselves, we should cautiously accept the same conclusion for any other animals that use such abilities. The list of animals that use tools, recognize themselves in a mirror, or exhibit self-doubt would currently include not only the great apes, but also dolphins, monkeys, elephants, pigs, corvids, and octopuses—although

47. If a patient is entirely unconscious with eyes persistently closed, then he is in a coma. If he has some form of sleep-wake cycle, and sometimes opens his eyes, but shows no signs of awareness, then he is in a vegetative state. Many vegetative state patients can make at least a partial recovery and even regain normal consciousness, but about half do not, and the longer the patient is in a vegetative state, the less likely he is to recover.

   - Page: 272

48. If the vegetative state continues for a month, then it is classed as a persistent vegetative state. If it continues for a year (depending on the injuries and the country of diagnosis), then the patient is classed as being in a permanent vegetative state, or PVS.

49. if the patient’s condition does improve and he shows some slight signs of awareness, such as tracking an object with his eyes, or responding to commands to move his arm, then he is upgraded to being in a minimally conscious state.

   - Page: 272

50. It’s relatively straightforward to ascertain whether a patient has moved from coma to vegetative state—you just have to see whether his eyes open and close—but it’s notoriously difficult to tell the difference between a vegetative state and a minimally conscious state. Although the vegetative state might appear to be an improvement over a coma, the truth is that consciousness may still be entirely absent. Therefore, to provide reassurance to the patient’s family that he is consciously present and might recover, an improved diagnosis of minimally conscious state is crucial.
   - Location: 4172-4176
   - Page: 273

51. For the patient’s family, it’s easy to mistake certain outward signs as hopeful evidence of consciousness—the patient might weep, smile, or grind his teeth—but in fact these are effectively reflexes and can occur with no consciousness whatsoever.

52. Recall from Chapter 3 that understanding the meaning of words—a skill unavailable to those under general anesthesia—is one of the simplest functions requiring consciousness. Therefore, showing brain activity for meaning in this experiment is a solid clue that consciousness is present. It is also a sensible reason for why patients who pass this part of the test go on to recover further degrees of awareness.

53. But eclipsing this list in the fight against stress is one simple mental exercise: meditation. This is often written off as being too esoteric and not sufficiently scientific, but it’s been shown to profoundly help virtually any mental ailment, whether the person has a psychiatric condition or is merely suffering from the stresses and strains of everyday life. There needn’t be anything mystical to meditation. Although there are hundreds of different varieties, in my view meditation is at its most powerful in its purest, most basic form: An ideal meditation is one where you try to be as aware as you can of as little as possible. We can focus on the world with our attentional magnifying glass set in two broad modes: We can mainly attend to the thoughts, ideas, facts, and so on that relate to other mental events or what our senses are picking up; or we can simply attend to our senses directly, passively absorbing the experience without thoughts. We may be on a mountaintop and feel a calm, profound awe as we attend entirely to the delicate beauty of the vast snowcapped peaks surrounding us. Or we could enter a very different experiential mode and try to calculate the volume of each mountain as a mathematical exercise, infer what the name of each mountain is from various clues, and recognize the different geological features of the rocks around us. In one state we have an open, quiet, passive perspective. In the other, we have a narrower, chattering mind, which isn’t nearly so aware of our sensory experiences. This quieter sense of beauty is closely related to the so-called meditative experience. Spending 20 minutes or more with nothing to do may sound pointless and tedious, but for those who try it, boredom, strangely, never seems an issue. It’s as if, by intensely focusing attention continuously on the darkness of your closed eyes, a blank wall, or something equally minimal, you are telling your brain that this object is utterly fascinating. Early in meditation practice, there may be a struggle as the mind wanders, but after a while it becomes easier to sustain attention on virtually nothing for long periods of time. And, far from being ineffectual, meditation causes substantial brain changes, both in the short term of a single session and in the long term, after months or years of practice. What’s more, these brain alterations seem the exact reverse of those caused by stress and many mental illnesses. In striking contrast to the effects of anxiety and stress, the simple act of entering a meditative state increases activity in the prefrontal parietal network, especially in the lateral prefrontal cortex. So, intriguingly, this is indirect objective evidence that meditation really does raise awareness.
   - Location: 4786-4806
   - Page: 313

54. Over years of practice, regular meditation also seems to permanently change the prefrontal parietal network, such that it becomes more pliable and efficient in its activity. And, again in direct contrast to what happens in depression and anxiety disorders, long-term meditation shifts the see-saw battles between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex firmly in the prefrontal cortex’s favor: The amygdala becomes far less likely to activate, probably partly because the prefrontal parietal network is now so good at stepping in and taking control. There is even evidence that long-term meditation increases the thickness of the prefrontal cortex, helping to protect against the natural thinning of this part of the brain in old age. At the same time, two months of meditation is sufficient to shrink the size of the fear-creating amygdala in previously stressed individuals.
   - Location: 4807-4812
   - Page: 314

55. All these results fit perfectly with long-term meditators’ descriptions of how this practice modifies their experiences. They report becoming profoundly calm, largely free from fear, and better able to handle pains and bothersome emotions when they do arise. They describe a greater degree of awareness and mental control, as if they somehow have more space and flexibility by which to perceive and handle all the details of the world and their own inner life. It’s as if, by establishing new attentional habits that shift focus away from highly grooved mental chunks, any unhelpful old ideas can more easily be displaced. When it comes to our emotional habits particularly, meditation is undoubtedly an invaluable tool to dislodge those painful schemas that might have housed themselves firmly in our unconscious minds, and which can be the source of so much of our painful thoughts and feelings.

56. if consciousness is all about innovation and shunting automatic habits to our unconscious, we can try to foster more awareness by biasing our minds as far as possible in the direction of innovation and relying at least a little bit less on our bank of deeply grooved habits. One potentially effective strategy along these lines to help combat our slow, age-related deterioration of conscious fire is to nurture a globally questioning, doubting perspective. If consciousness is fundamentally about being ravenous for those innovations that will help us in life, then by fostering a habit of skepticism of almost every mental chunk that passes through our consciousness, we’re setting up a superchunk, as it were, a higher habit to be restlessly searching for any little innovation we can get our hands on.

## Touching a Nerve
**Author:** Patricia Churchland

### Highlights (51)

1. MY BRAIN AND I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brain in more intimate terms—as me.

2. memories exist as modifications to the connectivity of neurons in the brain. Memories come into existence when brain cells—neurons—change how they connect to other neurons by sprouting new structure and pruning back old structure. This changes how one neuron connects to other neurons. Information about events in my life and about what makes me me is stored in patterns of connections between living brain cells—neurons. Memories of childhood, social skills, the knowledge of how to ride a bicycle and drive a car—all exist in the way neurons connect to each other. Here is the implication that may not be welcome: In dementing diseases and in normal aging, neurons die, brain structures degenerate. In death, brain cells quickly degenerate, with massive loss of information. Without the living neurons that embody information, memories perish, personalities change, skills vanish, motives dissipate. Is there anything left of me to exist in an afterlife? What would such a thing be? Something without memories or personality, without motives and feelings? That is no kind of me. And maybe that is really okay after all.

3. The conventional wisdom of the day assumed that Earth is at the center of the universe. Everything below the level of the moon is corruptible, changeable, earthly, imperfect. That is the realm of sublunar physics. Everything above the level of the moon is perfect, heavenly, unchanging, and so forth. This is the realm of supralunar physics. Different laws were thought to apply.

4. There are some things that brains do very slowly and that involve deep intelligence or deep shifts in worldview. Human brains do figure things out, sometimes only after years and years of pondering and marinating and seeing what makes sense. The tale that the idea of gravity occurred to Newton one sunny fall afternoon when an apple fell on his head is bogus. He had been chewing and chewing and chewing for decades on the nature of motion, both of the planets and here on Earth. There is much to ponder in the developments in neuroscience, and a brash little argument that concludes that humans have no control over their lives should be treated with some skepticism before we let it worm its way into our belief system. The slow dawning of deep ideas by human brains stands in stunning contrast with electronic computers. Computers can do many things much faster than we can, such as calculate. But computers—so far, anyhow—cannot do these deep things that human brains do slowly. They do not come up with new hypotheses about the nature of matter or the origin of DNA.

5. Imagine that you hear a sudden bang and turn your head to see the source. You locate the source as a pot that fell off a shelf. In response to the bang, neurons in the motor cortex made a decision to turn the head in the direction of the sound. Patterns of light smeared across your retina as your head turned. In addition, a copy of the head movement signal went to other areas of the brain, including your visual cortex. This movement signal copy (efference copy) is very useful because it tells your brain that your head, not something in the world, is moving. Absent an efference copy, your visual system would represent the shifting patterns on the retina as owed to things moving out there. Then confusion would reign. This organization for efference copy is very clever, because it means that you are not misled about the origin of the shifting patterns on your retina when you move your head or when you move your eyes or your whole body. It is, I suspect, an important source of data that the brain uses in generating the complex sense of me versus not-me.

6. when some part of the brain “reports” on its state to another part, you experience these reports as feelings, thoughts, perceptions, or emotions. You do not experience them in terms of neurons, synapses, and neurotransmitters. Similarly, when I am thinking about going fishing tomorrow, I am not directly aware of my thinking as a brain activity. I am aware of visual and movement images, maybe accompanied by a silent monologue. It goes sort of like this: I imagine myself at the creek side, night crawlers tucked in a can and speckled trout spooning in the cool shadows. I am not aware of this as the brain working. I am aware of it simply as making a plan.

7. One discovery in particular did cause a brouhaha among the remaining die-hard dualists. In the 1960s, Roger Sperry and his colleagues at Cal Tech studied patients whose hemispheres had been surgically separated as a last resort for the control of debilitating epileptic seizures. These subjects became known as the split-brain patients. Careful experiments showed that when the nerve bundle connecting the brain’s two hemispheres is surgically cut, the patient’s two hemispheres become somewhat independent cognitively. Lower structures, such as those in the thalamus and brainstem, are not separated—hence the qualification “somewhat independent.” In split-brain subjects, each hemisphere may separately experience the stimuli delivered exclusively to it. If, for example, a key is placed in the left hand and a ring is placed in the right hand and the subject is asked to use his hands to point to a picture of what he felt, the left hand points to a picture of a key and right hand to a picture of a ring.16 A split-brain subject may even make opposing movements with the two hands—the left hand picking up the phone, the right hand putting it down. Or if a visual stimulus, for example, is presented to just one hemisphere, the other hemisphere knows nothing about it. This was a completely stunning result. Did splitting the brain split the soul? The soul was supposed to be indivisible, not divisible like a walnut. But there they were, the split-brain results, available for all to see: if the brain’s hemispheres are disconnected, mental states are disconnected. Those results were a powerful support for the hypothesis that mental states are in fact states of the physical brain itself, not states of a nonphysical soul.

8. Descartes’s notion of the soul did not work out very well with physics either. The problem is this: if a nonphysical soul causes events to happen in a physical body, or vice versa, then the law of conservation of mass energy is violated. The trouble is, so far anyhow, that law seems very resilient against all comers. Well, maybe—just maybe—it does happen. But how? Even very roughly, how? How can energy be transferred from a completely nonphysical thing to a physical thing? Where does the soul get its oomph to have such an effect? What kind of energy does a soul have? Is it measurable? If not, why not? Descartes, interestingly, was fully aware of that particular problem and despaired of ever solving it.

10. Not until the early part of the twentieth century was it discovered that signaling of neurons depends on ions (charged atoms) abruptly moving back and forth across a neuron’s membrane. Exactly how that produces a signal was finally explained in 1952 by two British physiologists, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley. Their discovery revolutionized the science of the brain. But notice how recent that discovery was: 1952.

11. The naysayer’s inference takes us from ignorance—we are ignorant of the mechanisms for conscious awareness—to knowledge—we know that conscious awareness cannot be explained. This spells trouble. Suppose your doctor says, “We are ignorant of what causes your rash, so we know it is caused by a witch.” You would get a new doctor. Fast. Inferring knowledge from ignorance is a fallacy, and it is why the ancient Greeks labeled this fallacy an argument from ignorance.

12. the intense focus on the task of getting the body into the right position causes a shift in the typical “oscillating balance of power” between two general systems of the brain: the task-oriented system (for example, when you ponder why your computer lost its Internet connection) and the so-called default system, a kind of “inner reflection” or “mind-wandering” system (for example, when you go over a conversation you just had or plan for the next one). This latter is engaged when you briefly switch off-task and worry about the next job or fret over the past one or fantasize about something (like sex, for example). Using brain-imaging technology, researchers have shown that during meditation, the activity level of the self-reflection regions does decrease, and this occurs across various meditation routines.25 This finding is consistent with the claim that meditative practices can increase feelings of peacefulness, contentment, and joy. I am guessing that many other practices that involve focusing attention away from worries and on the present task—prayer, chanting, running, playing golf, playing in a quartet—have similar effects. Although there is a suggestive correlation between deactivation of the default network and feeling peaceful, this is not yet a demonstration of causality. Moreover, devoting a greater proportion of attention to on-task versus mind wandering may be only a small part of the story of postpractice bliss. For one thing, the value of spending more attention on the task likely depends on the task. If the task is one you do unwillingly, such as cleaning out horse stalls, then spending more time in the self-reflection (default) network having sexual fantasies is probably more conducive to joy.

13. Consider that people who take lysergic acid (LSD) or mescaline are apt to suppose that their remarkable experiences involve visiting a completely different but real world, a spirit world. Conviction of practitioners notwithstanding, the LSD and mescaline experiences are clearly brain-based phenomena. In both instances, the drug molecules bind to specialized serotonin receptors in the brain, changing the response patterns of the neurons. Understanding a remarkable experience, whether occasioned by drugs or meditation, within the framework of neuroscience makes no difference to the quality of the experience as such, but only to how we make sense of it.

15. Brain death is taken to imply that the critical brain regions for sustaining heartbeat and breathing (regions in the brainstem) no longer function, and the patient shows no brainstem reflexes, such as the pupil contracting when a light is shone on the eye.2 Some 25 different assessments are used to determine brain death. If, for example, there is some residual brainstem and cortical activity, then the brain is not dead. Then odd experiences may result.

17. MORAL NORMS and conventions are shaped by four interlocking brain processes: (1) caring (rooted in attachment to kith and kin and care for their well-being; (2) recognition of others’ psychological states, such as being in pain or being angry; (3) learning social practices by positive and negative reinforcement, by imitation, by trial and error, by analogy, and by being told; and (4) problem solving in a social context, for example, as new conditions produce new problems about resource distribution and migration, about interactions with outgroups, about how to resolve disputes about ownership of land, tools, and water.51

18. YOUR UNCONSCIOUS DOES THE TALKING THINK FOR a moment about your last conversation. Did you consciously choose your words? Did you consciously organize the structure and word order of the sentences you spoke? Did you consciously avoid using words that you know would offend your listener? Almost certainly not. Normal speech is under the guidance of nonconscious mechanisms. You became conscious of precisely what you unconsciously intended to say only when you said it. You modify your speech depending on whether you are talking to a child, a colleague, a student, or the dean. Not consciously, most probably. Paradoxically, speech is usually considered the paradigm case of conscious behavior—behavior for which we hold people responsible. Certainly, it does require consciousness; you cannot have a conversation while in deep sleep or in coma. Nevertheless, the activities that organize your speech output are not conscious activities. Speaking is a highly skilled business, relying on unconscious

19. Freud, though perhaps best remembered for his ideas about psychoanalysis, had theories about consciousness that are arguably much more important than his rather tendentious ideas about curing neuroses, theories that he developed around 1895. The young Freud was a neurologist who specialized in the loss of language capacities (aphasia) following stroke or other forms of brain damage. Freud realized that when we talk to each other or give a lecture or an interview, we are conscious of what we are saying, but the selection of words and the organization of words into sentences and arguments are all managed by unconscious processes. We are consciously aware of the general gist of what we want to say, but the details come out of the unconscious brain. Most of the time, this “general gist” may itself not be articulated in words. It is represented only in a vaguely imagistic way. Sometimes we have at best only a semi-awareness of what we intend to say. You will have noticed that if you stop to consciously prepare precisely what you will say next, you become tongue-tied. Then you do not talk in a normal fashion at all. I am sometimes amazed that as long as I know the general outline of what I plan to say in a lecture, it just all flows out, more or less as it should, but the word-by-word planning is a job my unconscious brain handles for me.

20. Not all reasoning has a languagelike form. We know this from the problem-solving behavior of intelligent animals such as ravens and elephants. As Diana Reiss has shown, elephants can recognize themselves in a mirror, as can dolphins.4 Bern Heinrich has shown that ravens can solve a novel, multistep problem in one trial.

21. Here is another reason to believe that thinking and problem solving need not always be language dependent. Preverbal children rely on sensory images and movement images to solve problems and make inferences, such as where a toy is hidden. But with the acquisition of language, children’s thoughts can become more complex, reflecting the complexity of the local dialect.

22. HABITS ARE another way in which your conscious and unconscious brain activities are seamlessly integrated. Forming a habit, whereby much in a job such as milking the cow can be shifted from your conscious brain to your unconscious brain, is a very efficient way of navigating the world. Of course, you have to be conscious to be milking a cow. It is just that an experienced milker can pay less attention to the task than a novice. Habit formation is a godsend. You strive for this in golf, bicycle riding, changing diapers, and shelling peas. It allows your conscious mind to work elsewhere. Automatizing certain behaviors by acquiring habits makes the business of getting on in life smoother and more polished. In the social world, you acquired habits as a child that serve you well in getting along; now you don’t have to think about saying please and thank you or about not breaking wind in public or staring at someone who is disfigured.

23. Acquiring habits and skills that can be performed pretty automatically is something all brains have evolved to do; it saves time, and it saves energy. Saving both is critical to the survival and well-being of all animals.

24. Your conscious brain needs your unconscious brain, and vice versa. The character and features of your conscious life depend on your unconscious activities. And of course, conscious events can in turn have an effect on unconscious activities. For example, if you consciously try to remember the layout of your grandmother’s house, this triggers unconscious operations of memory retrieval.

25. As discussed in Chapter 2, the movement-planning signal that gets looped back is usually called an efference copy—copy of a my-movement signal. The advantage of this separation of signals (me moving versus that thing moving) is of course that it allows the animal to better anticipate events in its world, thereby having a better shot at self-maintenance.

26. You cannot tickle yourself. Why not? The answer is that your brain generates an efference copy that loops back to the sensory systems identifying you as the source of the tickling movement. How do we know that? Here is some evidence. If you rig a device so that when you move a handle, a feather tickles your foot, your brain knows it is you. However, if you put a delay in the mechanism—a few seconds delay between moving the handle and the feather action—then you can tickle yourself (assuming you are ticklish at all, but that is a different story). Basically, with the delay in place, you fool your brain into thinking that the movement is not yours. This means that the brain is very sensitive to the timing of the “my-movement” signal.

27. When you say out loud, “I need to buy milk,” then a signal leaves the movement-planning brain and loops back to the sensory brain to indicate the source of the sound. When you merely think, “I need to buy milk,” this is covert speech (inner speech). Again, a movement-planning signal informs the sensory brain about the source of the covert speech—me. Except sometimes the mechanism is bungled for reasons that are still obscure. So sometimes a person may think, “I need to buy milk,” but because there is no efference copy signal or none with the right timing, he may fail to realize that his thought is actually his thought. He may in time come to believe that the FBI has put a radio in his brain and is transmitting voices into his brain. Auditory hallucinations are a not uncommon feature of schizophrenia, and a leading hypothesis to explain them refers to the failure of the mechanism for efference copy—identifying yourself as the source of your thoughts. Perhaps the timing of the mechanism, which needs to be very precise, is imprecise.

28. There is no algorithm—no exact recipe to follow—for good decision making. There are just very general bits of wisdom. Be reasonable, do your best, think it through, but don’t dither. A decision indefinitely postponed while awaiting yet more data is sometimes catastrophic. A decision made quickly on the basis of “gut feelings” without evaluating evidence can be idiotic. All decisions have to be made in a timely manner, and the nonconscious brain tends to have a pretty good idea about when that is. Once the relevant evidence is gathered and the future consequences predicted and weighed as best one can, the decision to be made is virtually always a decision under uncertainty. Sometimes the uncertainty is massive, but even then, some decisions are clearly worse than others. Feelings and emotions play a role, but not too much; other people’s advice plays a role, but not too much. Decision making is a constraint satisfaction process, meaning that we assign values to certain things, subject to constraints. Thus, we may have many goals and desires about both the short term and the long term, and a good decision satisfies the most important ones.

29. Roughly speaking, we do know that in constraint satisfaction operations, the brain integrates skills, knowledge, memories, perceptions, and emotions and somehow, in a manner we do not precisely understand, comes to a single result.

30. Some economists have explored human decision-making behavior in tightly controlled experimental conditions, with revealing results. Called neuroeconomics, this research involves structured games, and the subjects play with real money.23 In the game known as Ultimatum, one person (proposer) is given a sum of money, say $10, and he can propose an offer (between $0 and $10) to another player (the responder). If the responder accepts the offer, they both keep the money—what is offered is kept by responder, and what is held back by the proposer is kept by him. If the responder rejects the offer, they both get nothing.

31. one major outcome of this neuroeconomic research has been the exploration of the role of emotions in good, intelligent decision making and a reconsideration of narrowly defining rationality in terms of maximizing monetary income.

32. Aristotle understood, as did many later philosophers, including certainly David Hume and Adam Smith, that emotions play an important role in wise decision making. They knew that stylizing rationality as following a rule or principle that seems rational, though having a simple logical appeal, often leads to disaster. That is because no single rule can cover every contingency that can crop up in the world, and some contingencies are so surprising that they call for wise judgment, not slavishly adhering to a rule.

33. it is useful to distinguish between the structures that support being conscious of anything at all and structures that contribute to being conscious of this or that—the so-called contents of consciousness. If you are in coma, for example, you are typically not aware of seeing or hearing or smelling anything. When you are awake, you are aware, for example, of the sight of a dog, his bark, and his doggy smell. Those are the so-called contents of consciousness: awareness of specific events.
   - Location: 3274-3277
   - Page: 214

34. According to Schiff’s hypothesis, to be conscious of anything requires activity from a ribbon of neurons in the middle of the thalamus, whose activity is itself regulated by neurons in the brainstem, an evolutionarily very old structure (Figure 9.3). Called the central thalamus (also called the intralaminarnuclei of the thalamus), its neurons have pathways, though sparse, to the top layer of every part of the cortex.
   - Location: 3280-3283
   - Page: 214

35. During the awake and dreaming states, neurons in the central thalamus fire in bursts at an unusually high rate—800 to 1,000 times per second (hertz), a remarkably energy-intensive behavior not seen anywhere else in the nervous system.
   - Location: 3300-3301
   - Page: 216

36. Damage to the central thalamus has serious consequences for consciousness. If a lesion occurs on one side of the central thalamus, then the person tends not to be conscious of or attend to events related to the affected side (which is always on the opposite side of the body, because in the brain there is a crossover of pathways—right brain controls left side and vice versa). What happens if there is damage on both sides? The person is in coma.

37. So what is the difference in the brain between conscious processing and unconscious processing of a stimulus as revealed by the masking technique and brain imaging? Here is the simplified answer: When the visual signal dog is masked (not consciously perceived), only early visual areas (in the back of the brain) show activation. By contrast, when the visual signal is consciously seen, the posterior activity has spread to more frontal regions, including parietal, temporal, and prefrontal areas (Figure 9.6). Dehaene and Changeux refer to this as global ignition. This pattern of posterior to anterior spreading of activity seems to uphold Baars’s hunch that conscious perception involves global connectivity in the brain, whereas unconscious perception is restricted to a smaller region.

   - Page: 223

38. A robust signature of conscious perception—a waveform in the scalp recordings—occurs about 300 milliseconds after the stimulus is presented. Significantly, these findings appear to hold also for other modalities. This result suggests that the back-to-front global ignition required to yield awareness of a sensory stimulus takes about 300 milliseconds—about one-third of a second. This makes sense, since it takes time for a signal to travel from one neuron to the next, and a lot of territory has to be covered if you are a signal traveling from the retina to the prefrontal cortex. One important development concerning the connectivity undergirding global ignition is the discovery that brains of all mammals, and possibly all animals, appear to have a small-world organization. Not every neuron is connected to every other neuron. If that were the case, our heads would have to be massively larger than they are. As neuroscientist Olaf Sporns and his colleagues have shown, any given neuron is only a few connections away from most other neurons. Brains have a “six degrees of separation” organization.

   - Page: 225

40. Some groups of neurons are hubs for putting other less well-connected neurons into contact with each other. The term coined for the especially well-connected neurons is rich club neurons. So a signal might follow this sequence: from a locally connected neuron to a feeder neuron, then to a rich club neuron, to a different feeder neuron, and then to a new local neuron (Figure 9.7).

41. Indeed, we may experience much for which we have no precise linguistic characterization at all, such as the difference between the smell of cinnamon and the smell of cloves or the difference between feeling energetic and feeling excited, or what an orgasm is like. If we consider that language is essentially a tool for communication, then it is no surprise that consciousness does not require language.

42. What is the role of attention? What is attention? Attention is presumably part of your brain’s evaluative business, needed because conscious awareness has a limited capacity. Scientists characterize two kinds of attention. One involves a stimulus that “grabs” your attention—a stimulus such as a loud sound, the sudden smell of smoke, or a bright flash of light. That is the bottom-up variety, and it is clearly related to survival, reflecting when priority must be given to a sudden danger over a current aim. The other is top-down (voluntary), and reflects goals, both short term and long term, as well as preferences. The brain regions involved in this kind of attention are more toward the front of the brain.
   - Location: 3557-3562
   - Page: 232

43. Does consciousness just boil down to paying attention? Probably not, although the two are closely linked. Distinguishing attention from consciousness per se is motivated by the finding that during certain tasks, such as reading, a form of nonconscious attention is at work. How do we know that? When you read, your eyes fixate on a chunk (between about 7 and 20 characters) and then jump to the next chunk. To the reader, it may not seem so, but eye trackers show unequivocally that fixating-then-jumping is actually what your eyes do. Reading is really hopping along the lines, chunk by chunk, however smooth your clever brain makes it seem. The data indicate that just before the eyes make their next jump (saccade), your nonconscious attention scans the next chunk, selects a meaty word for your center of gaze to light on (a word like murder, not a word like indeed), and guides the eye movement accordingly. This is attention performing in an anticipatory capacity and almost certainly is a factor in many kinds of complex and skilled movements, such as hunting, cooking, and parenting, when attention shifts to relevant components of the ongoing scene. At most this shows that we can sort of pay attention without awareness. What has not been shown experimentally is that we can be aware without paying attention. Attention, as psychologist Michael Cohen and his colleagues point out, seems to be necessary, but not sufficient, for consciousness.

44. The Society for Neuroscience has launched a web page called Brainfacts.org. It is a trustworthy site with a full-time staff. It is supported by both the Kavli Foundation and the Gatsby Foundation. Nick Spitzer, a renowned neuroscientist, is editor in chief, and he has assembled an impressive list of editors known for their accomplishments as well as their integrity. One section, called “Ask an Expert,” allows you to ask whether what you have been told is rubbish, a gross exaggeration, a mild puffing up of the hard facts, or generally accurate, if surprising. Bear in mind, too, that even within a field such as neuroscience or linguistics, there are often educated disagreements about what exactly a result means. That is because so much, including so much that involves basic principles, is still not nailed tightly down. Neuroscience is a young science. So even the experts on Brainfacts.org may well qualify their answer to your question by acknowledging that there is much that is not known.

## The Private Life of the Brain
**Author:** Susan Greenfield

### Highlights (29)

1. In many cases, damage to the limbic system results in inappropriate emotion. For example, Klüver-Bucy5 syndrome occurs when a certain part of the limbic system, the amygdala,6 is damaged. Patients exhibit a high sexual drive, directed not so much toward a prospective partner as toward anything around them, even inanimate objects. Along similar lines, removal of another region, the cingulate cortex, 7 in experimental animals results in “sham” rage—a pattern of behavior that contains all the outward features of a genuine, infuriated state but that occurs for no obvious reason.

2. To illustrate the point that genes alone cannot simply control or create our personalities and behavior, the neurologist Richard Cytowic25 has made the following, illuminating calculation. The number of human genes has been estimated to be at most about 1,000,000. The number of synapses in the adult human brain, however, is far more, some 1,000,000,000,000,000—which is 1,000,000,000 times in excess of the basic genetic elements.

3. My particular definition of mind will be that it is the seething morass of cell circuitry that has been configured by personal experiences and is constantly being updated as we live out each moment.

4. at one end of the spectrum pure emotion—the type of sensation experienced during road rage, a crime of passion, an orgasm, or at a rave—can best be viewed as the core of our mental states when, as when we are infants, feeling is not greatly tempered with individual memories, with cultural or private meaning, or, most important of all, with the self. Feelings just are. When people lose their minds, blow their minds, or are out of their minds with fear or ecstasy, they are no longer accessing that highly personalized set of values, history, and unique view of life. They are no longer making full use of their personalized configurations of brain connections, which I have defined as the mind. Instead, they are traveling back to the time when they were very young, before such internal connections existed, when the external world therefore had no personal meaning, and indeed when they were swamped with emotions. Emotions, I am going to try to convince you, are the building block of consciousness. Emotions are with us all the time, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on how much you are using, or losing, your mind at any one moment. I shall be arguing that you cannot understand consciousness without understanding emotion, and that consciousness is not purely rational or cognitive as some, particularly those working in artificial, computational systems, have implied. Above all, not until we establish what emotions actually are and how and when they are generated—when we lose our minds or blow our minds—only then will we truly appreciate the mind itself.

5. (i) emotion is the most basic form of consciousness; (2) minds develop as brains do, both as a species and as an individual starts to escape genetic programming in favor of personal, experience-based learning; (3) the more you have of (1) at any particular moment, then the less you have of (2), and vice versa.

7. In evolutionary terms, we can view emotions as processes where one is highly interactive with the environment. If you are interactive with the environment, then you are focusing on your senses, and the more you are the passive recipient of the senses, the less you are accessing the mind. The more you do this, the more you are letting go of the Self. It could be the case, then, that the more emotional you are, the less the world around you means anything, and the more you have literally let yourself go. In this way, one may be still conscious but indeed be out of one’s mind,

8. the brain must clearly be appreciated as an integrated, holistic system, whereby the awesome abilities it displays are not yet attributable to any single subcomponent or process, be it a chemical, a gene, a brain region, or synchronized electrical activity.

9. Children can more readily abandon themselves to the joys, perhaps it is even the ecstasy, of an amusement-park ride or the sight of the sea, compared to adults, who find it virtually impossible to shake off the dripping worry of the mortgage payments. According to David Warburton, director of human psychopharmacology at Reading University, children laugh on average 300 times a day. By adulthood, this number plummets to 50. But by the same token, a child will be more readily frightened by a creak on the stair, by someone with a white sheet draped over his head, or by a train roaring into the station. Children experience emotions as strongly, perhaps even more strongly, than adults, but seemingly, for less good reason. We may call them “crybabies,” not because of the nature of the emotion itself, but because such strong feelings have been evoked by such a feeble cause. To a much greater extent, children are passive victims of their senses, one-off experiences that have an impact by virtue only of their intrinsic physical quality: the brightness, loudness, smell, taste, or touch of whatever is going on. This exaggerated emphasis on the actual sensuality of waves of sound and light and of clouds of chemicals pervading the ears, eyes, nose, skin, and mouth is because, for the very young, there is nothing else. Children are less equipped to interpret the present situation against the sobering yet reassuring background of past experience, a private collection of memories that tells us that it is only an ordinary person masquerading as a ghost under the white sheet or that there are more significant possessions in life than an ice cream cone that has fallen on the sidewalk. As we grow up and see the world increasingly in the light of previous experiences, we develop a personalized inner world of private resources that increasingly act as a retaliatory buffer to the assault of the “booming, buzzing confusion”1 that previously poured into our brains unopposed. And as we continue to live out our lives as adults, more and more associations pile on and around the objects, events, and people among which we are thrown. This rapidly expanding inner world of personal associations offers an ever-growing framework of reference, an increasing degree of meaning to ongoing experience. The most obvious type of meaning is the culturally and socially accepted identity of objects and people around us. But gradually these objects and people acquire ever more extensive and idiosyncratic associations, and hence ever more eccentric and intense degrees of significance. The more ramifying and multiple the associations, the more “meaning,” or “relevance,” an object will have.

10. One type of memory is known as “procedural memory.” It is needed for skills such as playing the piano and driving. These laboriously acquired talents, as most of us know from tedious firsthand experience, require many repeated trials before the brain masters the required coordination between senses and movement for the eventual, seemingly effortless execution. Memory for this type of learned sequence of procedure is organized within the region dubbed the brain’s “autopilot,” the cauliflower-shaped structure that we saw in Chapter 1, sits seemingly in semiautonomy at the back of the head. It is even referred to as though it were a separate entity, “the little brain,” or cerebellum.33 Processes here have been successfully modeled in silicon.34 They enable the brain to coordinate inputs and outputs and therefore lend themselves to the algorithmic processes of biasing connections that have been stimulated or exercised more than others. But the ability to ride a bicycle or drive a car, once learned, makes little intrusion into that special first-person, personal world of our consciousness. These memories for skills can therefore be left within the orderly interstices of cells that make up the cerebellum.

11. Consider instead the other broad class of memory, the type that permeates most intimately our conscious, everyday thoughts and determines our view of the outside world. Completely separate from implicit, procedural memory is “declarative memory.”35 Declarative memory is explicit, in that we are aware we are remembering something in the first place. But what we are remembering can be divided further. On the one hand, there is memory for facts, such as the French word for table or the habits of cockroaches. On the other hand, there is the memory of spending a day last summer at the seaside with Auntie Flo. Initially, these two types of memory are treated in the same way by the brain. Central to operations is the hippocampus, so named because of its supposed resemblance in shape to a seahorse.

12. A very small child, and indeed autistic people of all ages,51 cannot grasp that different people are just that, people with their own sets of ideas, their own inner universe—a separate mind that is comparable yet different from their own. In evolutionary terms, this individual milestone would be matched with our very recent Cro Magnon development over only the last 40,000 years, when we began to display different behaviors to other primates in the use of bone artifacts or of teeth from carcasses serving as food by using them also as decoration—a necklace of teeth, for example. Only then did we start to indulge in art. Once we established language and were able to escape the immediate here and now, then not only were we able to plan for the future and remember the past, but to indulge in scenarios that have never been, to imagine magical entities and mystical, mythical scenarios. This is the time, too, when religion became practiced, in that our imaginations were powerful enough to extend belief to nonphysical entities, just as young children universally believe in magic. It is in early childhood that the imagination is most fertile for most of us. Young children start to see links between objects, albeit frequently superficial or idiosyncratic ones: because these associations will be the result of relatively few experiences, they may well be suppressed later because more frequent associations become dominant or because the original pairings turn out to be supernumerary. On the other hand, at this early stage, thanks to language, connections are agile enough to be formed in the absence of external sensory cues, yet sufficiently unconstrained by inner resources rigorously cross-checked against endless variants of reality. At this stage, a child has a robust enough mind to become engrossed in a comic, with its visual prompts, but not mature enough to conjure up pictures entirely from words alone, as in adult novels. Their need for sensory stimulation is decreased sufficiently in urgency to listening to stories, where the narrator adds tones of voice and interacts, but not to read a story undistracted on their own. And before these censoring inner resources are so firmly established, how much easier it is for a large cardboard box to become a car or a house, or to believe that Teddy really is alive like you are. It is this ability to see something in terms of something else, to use one’s imagination, that Mithen points to as the apotheosis of human achievement over that of the other primates. But as we grow further, we stunt our imaginations. Gradually, one screens out the instinctive fear of the dark, the sensual joy of a sunset, or the awesome impact of the sheer size of the sea. Whereas Mithen offers the final stage of human evolution as the stage at which we can actually use our imaginations, I would argue there is one more stage, where the attainment of an individual adult mind matches the true civilizing of our ancestors. Wisdom and understanding replace magic and superstition.

13. Let me remind you again of the central idea: this carefully nurtured wisdom and understanding is lost during a state of strong emotion. At parties, on the ski slope, on the dance floor, and at the table, we chase the sensational and the sensual, literally the stimulation of our senses: after all, we are still able to experience strong emotions on occasions, even as sophisticated and cynical adults. This undeniable fact would suggest that our brains can transiently reconfigure in some way, to revert back to the state where our carefully controlled life, our personal reality, increasingly fades out in favor of the moment, the context-free, meaningless sensation where we have quite literally let ourselves go.
   - Location: 1457-1461
   - Page: 95

14. emotions, as I am suggesting, are an abrogation of Self, and if the abrogation of Self is achieved by only modest neuronal networking, then the next big question to sort out is how we manage to experience different emotions. How does pleasure, say, differ in physical brain terms from fear?
   - Location: 1836-1837
   - Page: 120

15. I pondered why exactly a loss of control would be pleasurable and eventually realized that only when you are out of control can the senses really dominate because “you” have been swept away. Pleasure is, literally, a sensational moment of life.

16. When we wake sweating from a nightmare, afraid of the dark, we may not only be revisiting our childhood but gaining some insight into the alarming world of the schizophrenic.9 For schizophrenics, as for children, fears cannot be rationalized so easily. As with children, the individual is the passive recipient of events with little control over what is happening. Hence a frequent feature of schizophrenia, paranoia, where one feels one is being controlled by nameless, external forces. The outside world rushes in with its full impact of raw, literal sensations.
   - Location: 1997-2001
   - Page: 131

17. Of course schizophrenics are not to be likened in every regard to children, yet there are certain similarities. In both cases, the state of mind is disconnected and highly labile.12 In both cases, one focus of awareness will readily be displaced by another, like some variety show of diverse, unrelated acts, where a rapid succession of neuronal groupings rapidly succeed one another with no attempt at a continuing theme. Another similarity in the mental state of child and schizophrenic is that there are no abstractions:13 instead, a kind of raw experience dominates where consciousness devolves not around ideas or theories, but on immediate objects, unique events, or a particular person. This emphasis on the literal, sensory world would account for another feature of both schizophrenia and childhood, the inability to interpret the general meaning of sayings and proverbs, beyond the overt significance that, for example, a stone that rolls does indeed gather no moss.14

18. One sign of schizophrenia is indeed “inappropriate emotion,”18 where the patient will spontaneously laugh or act frightened in an unpredictable way. The schizophrenic may giggle at a funeral or be overly concerned about a picture on the wall. Such behavior could be, and often is, written off as irrational, much like the fears and laughter of children: inexplicable, illogical responses within the constructs of a reality that most of us have constructed for ourselves, along the lines appropriate for our particular society and culture. The schizophrenic, like the child, is emotionally far more mercurial. Above all, like the child, the schizophrenic is trapped in the present.

19. The more we feel, the less we are, literally, ourselves—the less we are encumbered by previous, idiosyncratic associations that personalize the brain into a mind.

20. Interestingly enough, dreaming and wakefulness are closer to each other than we might think, in subjective terms, too. When stimulation is very strong for some people during wakefulness, for instance when laughing intensely or in midorgasm, they can suddenly fall into dreaming sleep.17 This amazing phenomenon is accompanied by the muscle paralysis that normally accompanies dreaming. In less extreme examples, usually when very frightened or sexually excited, again, one becomes quasi-paralyzed, literally weak in the knees.18

21. In dealing with the evolution of emotions, we are reaching much further back than we would need had we been simply exploring human cognition—as have Dennett, Deacon, Mithen, and Calvin—all reviewed in Chapter 2. We should look for the evolution of feeling, not merely six million years ago, when we parted company with the chimpanzees, but to the evolution of the animal brain in the first place.

22. Anxiety is a state of mind that is initiated and perpetuated with very little external assistance. Anxiety, one might think, is far closer to fear than is pleasure, but in brain terms, it could be the exact opposite. After all, pure fear, as pleasure, is very much in the here and now. Anxiety, on the other hand, as mentioned in Chapter 6, depends on the ability to forsake the present moment and anticipate an uncomfortable future.

23. Fear differs from anxiety, not simply in that one is conditioned whereas the other is not, but in humans, at least, by the fact that anxiety can be internally sustained for very long periods of time.

24. At the sheer physical level of body function, it is now being increasingly acknowledged that laughter has a beneficial effect on health.25 Respiration is deeper after one laughs, which in turn causes one to be more relaxed. In addition, there is robust evidence that laughter raises the efficiency of the immune system.

25. As with pleasure itself, it is hard to guarantee absolutely that one will be able to laugh. Yes, tickling will automatically produce laughter, but in a particularly unrewarding, reflex fashion. Tickling elicits laughter, but it does not give pleasure. Hence laughter must be not a cause but a symptom of pleasure, a sign that it is occurring, rather than the reason in the first place. But if laughter is a consequence of pleasure, it is strange that we do not laugh when we are in the very situations that are most pleasurable. Why do we not burst out laughing in midorgasm, while tasting a particularly fine claret, or while bungee jumping? Let’s look a little more closely at the situations in which we do laugh.

27. In summary, the key concepts arising from this book are as follows: (1) emotion is the most basic form of consciousness; (2) minds develop as brains do—both as a species and as an individual starts to escape genetic programming in favor of personal experience-based learning; (3) the more you have of (1) at any moment, then the less you have of (2), and vice versa. The more the mind predominates over raw emotion, the deeper the consciousness. When I mention this idea, people sometimes think I mean that consciousness is literally deeper: for example, that one would perceive deeper colors, say, a red instead of a pink. That is not what I mean at all. In fact, as I hope I have persuaded you, consciousness characterized by the raw senses is indicative of a consciousness at its most minimal. Instead, I am using deep as a metaphor, albeit a very well-worn one. A deeper consciousness is one where the world around you is not so much very bright or very noisy—quite the contrary, it is, instead, a world laden with personal meaning.
   - Location: 3355-3363
   - Page: 219

28. Finally, we come to the basic idea that emotions are an abrogation of the Self. The more I wrote of this book, the more I found it impossible to distinguish mind from the concept of Self. After all, if mind is the personalization of the brain, then what more, or what less, could Self actually be? I’ll stick my neck out and say that as far as I’m concerned, the two terms might as well be synonymous.

29. A synapse is a highly specialized point of contact, as different from a mere gap as riverboat stations are from featureless banks facing each other across the water.2 A simpler but less specialized system involves the mere fusion of one dendrite of one cell with that of another, so that electrical current spreads passively, without the need for a participating chemical. These points of fusion are called “gap junctions.” Perhaps spread of activation through the agency of gap junctions is what distinguishes the formation of a very large neuronal assembly. In support of this idea, John Jefferys and his colleagues have confirmed that the much-studied oscillations of some 40 Hz are generated as a result of normal synaptic transmission. What is particularly intriguing, however, is that Jefferys has also shown that it is possible for neurons to work collectively at a much faster rate, that there are in addition much faster oscillations of some 200 Hz. This higher-frequency orchestration is mediated not by synapses but by gap junctions.

## English Humour for Beginners

1. The mimophant – a zoological wonder invented by Arthur Koestler – is a cross between the mimosa and the elephant. The mimophant is touchy like the mimosa when he is concerned; but he is as lightfooted as an elephant when it comes to others.

2. ‘A second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience’, said a young girl I knew, soon after my arrival in England. I was struck by the wit and the perfect, concise wording of the remark and said so. ‘Oh, that’s not by me,’ she replied with a modest smile, ‘it’s by Dr Johnson.’

3. Farewell to English Humour A short while ago I published a book, called How to be Decadent,* which ended with these words: ‘Thirty years ago I admired the English enormously but did not like them very much; today I admire them much less but love them much more.’ I also said that in England the ruling class did not rule, the working class did not work and the middle class was not in the middle. ‘If you are a worker you are not to work, if you are a solicitor you are not to solicit, if you are a street walker you are not to walk the streets, if you are the Lord Privy Seal you are not a Lord and if you are the Black Rod you most certainly are not black (nor, for that matter, are you a rod). This aspect of England seems to be unchanging and unchangeable. Quite recently the British have brought in a new holiday (the one and only Socialist act of a Socialist government): the First of May. This year (1979) the First of May was celebrated on the Sixth of May. Quaint. Queer. Endearing.’ But is it? Is it not time to be a little less queer and a shade less endearing? I said earlier in this book that the famous Jewish sense of humour got lost in transit to Israel. That is a good thing because the new state of Israel needs very different qualities from the self-effacing, self-mocking attitudes of East European Jewry. Circumstances in Britain have also changed, just as drastically as the circumstances of the Jews, and Britain, too, needs new qualities and a new spirit. Instead of being the Good Losers the British ought to become the Nasty Winners; instead of sophisticated self-mockery they ought to learn repulsive competitiveness; instead of the endearing understatement they must get into the habit of wild exaggeration; instead of the enchanting ability of laughing at themselves they ought to learn taking themselves seriously. And what about a few lessons in kicking the man who is down? When all these things are learnt, Britain will certainly be a less pleasant place to live in but it will have a chance to survive. Once we have risen again to the high living standards of East Germany, we may start regaining our tolerance, our self-mocking understatement and our inimitable ability of laughing at ourselves. The English sense of humour is the most wonderful thing any nation can boast of; if Britain wants to survive as a leading industrial nation it must get rid of it without delay.

## Survivors
**Author:** Richard Fortey

### Highlights (21)

1. It is a strange fact about science that until an object or a phenomenon receives a name in some way it does not exist. Names really matter. They retrieve something from an endless chaos of anonymity into a world of lists, inventories, and classification. The next stage is to understand their meaning.
   - Location: 867-869

2. The waves surge and retreat from the stacked-up sea floors that once built Mistaken Point. This continually punished land will inevitably succumb to erosion, and the record of ancient life buried by chance so long ago beneath clouds of volcanic ash will be returned to the sea as a billion tiny particles. In the end, only the sea endures, it is the greatest survivor of them all. Even the continents mutate and remake themselves, driven by the internal engines of the earth powering slow but inexorable movements of tectonic plates. Mountain ranges are elevated and then reduced to rubble, but life can outlast mere Himalayas. Peripatus’ relatives once walked upon Gondwana when Africa was united with Australia and the Americas.

3. After the moon rocks were dated using the best technology of the day the question of the antiquity of the green planet to which the moon was partnered was finally laid to rest: 4.55 billion (plus or minus 0.05). The geological time period before the Cambrian was simply known as Precambrian for more than a century – after all, that is what it undoubtedly was, ‘before the Cambrian’. But when this time period was recognised as so vastly long, it became necessary to divide it into several named chunks to help us order events in the earth’s history. The Archaean Era is that part of deep geological time that ends at 2500 million years ago, or 2.5 billion years if you prefer. After this came the Proterozoic Era which, in terms of strata, lies above it and extends to the base of the Cambrian Period 542 million years ago (the Cambrian is the first subdivision of the Palaeozoic Era). The Ediacaran, the latest addition to the roll call of geological time, begins at 635 million years ago and is slotted into the top of the Proterozoic. The Proterozoic Period covers a very long period, and these days is usually divided into three which used to be known as Lower, Middle and Upper, but are now formally known as Palaeo-, Meso- and Neoproterozoic respectively. The Neoproterozoic begins arbitrarily at 1000 million years ago, and the Mesoproterozoic at 1600 million years ago (1.6 billion), so the Palaeoproterozoic occupies the time period 2.5–1.6 billion years ago.

8. Now we are approaching the top of the tree of life, a period about a hundred thousand years ago, during which our own species emerged from one of a group of hominin ancestors. It was as eventful a time as any other mentioned in this book, for the same period saw the world gripped in a great ice age, obliging many animals to evolve to cope with the new challenges posed by freezing climates.
   - Location: 3860-3862
   - Page: 252

9. The first crisis that should be revisited is the ‘great oxidation event’ at 2.4 billion years ago. When cyanobacteria introduced a significant level of oxygen into the atmosphere, the effect on the hordes of prokaryotes that thrived only in its absence must have been devastating.
   - Location: 4408-4410
   - Page: 288

10. Then there were periods of extreme climate change. The ‘Snowball Earth’, or Marinoan glaciation of 650 million years ago was a time when – so its proponents believe – the earth was encased in a solid layer of ice. Enthusiasts for this kind of event recognise several other ‘Snowballs’ in the Precambrian, and if they are right, periodic freezing conditions were hazards that life had to negotiate. Even under the most punishing scenario, however, there must still have been islands of water around active thermal vents like volcanoes and hot seeps, which should have provided a conduit for survivors. Recall that most organisms were small at that time, so this is not like conserving the giant panda. Many scientists believe that the extreme Snowball is not correct, and that an equatorial region remained free of ice (or was ‘slushy’ at most). Very few dispute that the influence of ice extended down into low latitudes during this interval, and must have had a profound influence.

11. After the freeze the flowering of the latest Precambrian, Ediacaran fauna followed, as I described at Mistaken Point in Newfoundland, where a strange undersea confection of soft-bodied, but indubitably sizeable organisms spread over the world. Life grew bigger. This is one biological drama that seems to have vanished without trace. Jellyfish were there, and probably sponges, but most of the Ediacaran animals remain more or less controversial, and do not include obvious ‘ancestors’ of those that followed.
   - Location: 4419-4423
   - Page: 289

12. the Cambrian Period that followed. It bears something of the stamp of the modern biological world. We are all children of the Cambrian, whether we know it or not. We have seen how vertebrates and invertebrates alike root back to this most creative time in our planet’s history. A time when hard shells appeared in several groups of organisms for the first time allowing for protection from predators, and for the lodging of strong muscles. But ‘soft bodied’ animals are as varied as shelled ones when suitable rocks to preserve them are discovered, as in Chengjiang in China, so it was not just a matter of shells making merry. Many of the animals in this book entered the stadium at this point: molluscs, arthropods, brachiopods, penis worms, peanut worms, velvet worms, wormy worms (see An Inveterate Bunch), hemichordates, chordates. Yet the Ediacarans had vanished, so there must have been a mass extinction of these enigmatic fractal organisms and their odd companions at the close of Precambrian times. Most palaeontologists agree that there was a time lag in the fossil record between the disappearance of the Ediacara curiosities and the full ‘explosion’ of Cambrian forms.

13. Onwards and upwards to the late Ordovician, when another glaciation was centred on the South Pole of the time, in northern Africa. 445 million years ago ice sheets grew once again, sea levels fell concomitantly, and the tropical zone contracted in sympathy. I have stood on top of scratches made by an ancient ice sheet in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco while all around a dry desert stretched away, and some bird sadly mewed in the sky for the least edible scrap. I was reminded how profoundly the continents move, slowly shifting climate zones, slowly transforming the face of the world.
   - Location: 4442-4446
   - Page: 290

14. At the end of the Ordovician, geographic and oceanographic conditions were just right for the growth of ice sheets, and the world was plunged into a climatic extreme. Many animals that had flourished since the Cambrian went into decline. When the ice sheets melted, another low oxygen crisis was released on the world’s oceans; many more invertebrates died out, including several trilobite families.
   - Location: 4446-4449
   - Page: 290

15. After the crisis, life in the sea expanded once again. Ancient oceans were consumed as mountain chains grew and were eroded away. Plants and animals made the crucial moves towards colonising the land, and more of our potential survivors had entered the circuit of life.

   - Page: 291

16. Yet sixty million years after the Ordovician glaciation, another crisis in the late part of the Devonian Period put paid to coral reefs and many more trilobites, brachiopods, and jawless fish. Recent research supports the idea that this was an extinction event with several pulses rather than the single event (termed the Kelwasser Event) that was first recognised. Once again, the spread of oxygen-poor waters through the oceans played an important part in the stresses placed on marine life: another hurdle to clear.

17. All this was as nothing compared to the massive extinction that happened at the end of the Permian Period 250 million years ago. Life both on land and in the sea was devastated.

21. The eventual recovery from the trauma allowed mammals and birds to thrive in a way they never had before, for flowers to brighten the landscape, for bees and butterflies to buzz and flit into their respective futures. All mass extinctions ultimately generate winners as well as losers. They help life move on. And so, to a climatic deterioration a mere 1.6 million years ago which brought on the last of the ice ages, in the Pleistocene.

## A Brief History of Fascist Lies

   - Page: 22

4. the antidemocratic, violent, and racist revolution of the Right that fascism represented was adopted in other countries under different names: Nazism in Germany, nacionalismo in Argentina, integralismo in Brazil, and so on. Fascism was transnational even before Mussolini used the word fascismo, but when fascism became a regime in Italy in 1922, the word received worldwide attention and acquired different meanings in local contexts.
   - Location: 337-341
   - Page: 22

5. It was, in short, the return of superstition. As such, Borges identified fascism as antithetical to reading. In 1944, he warned that fascism would eventually lead to the destruction of knowledge. It would open the way to the “death of all books on earth.” Ironically, since he did not have Borges’s 1944 knowledge of the then-ongoing extermination of the Jews, Freud also ironically argued that book burning was better than body burning. For Freud, the Nazi burning of his books represented the fascist rejection of learned culture: “What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burnt me; nowadays they are content with burning my books.”
   - Location: 843-848
   - Page: 55

6. The history of populists in power, from Juan Perón to Silvio Berlusconi, and of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini before them, is full of self-aggrandizing and mythmaking tendencies—tendencies that were fully supported and sometimes initiated by their parties and followers. Dismissive and simple explanations about the stupidity of authoritarian fraudsters and their gullible followers do not actually explain much. Instead, they are symptomatic of a refusal to understand what we might not like: the mythical incarnation of truth that leads to its decimation. Trump is an extreme populist with a xenophobic anti-egalitarian agenda. Programmatic politics and winning elections against him are more important to the present and future of democratic life than assessing his psychiatric state or stereotyping him as a con man. He does not lie because he is a crazy cheater; he lies because he belongs to a political tradition that proposes an alternative notion of truth that emanates from the sacred infallibility of the leader. The racism and misogyny springing from the White House are political, attempts to transform reality in order to make it closer to fantasy. This cannot be ignored.
   - Location: 1561-1569
   - Page: 102

7. Moreover, we should ask ourselves why the critiques of authoritarian populists often do not go beyond the simplistic use of adjectives, even insults. Abnormalizing Trump normalizes the rest of the American landscape, as if Trump is a parenthetical aside in an unblemished history of pluralism, equality, and respect for historical truth. This was never the case in the United States, any more than it has been in the rest of the world. In fact, the forms of extreme right-wing populism that emerged during the Cold War (McCarthyism and later the presidential candidacies of Barry Goldwater and George Wallace) are key American antecedents for understanding the appeal of Trump’s repressive ideas, racist lies, and authoritarian style.
   - Location: 1570-1575
   - Page: 103

8. Globally, Trumpist mythmaking has a history that includes populists and fascist leaders like Juan Perón in Argentina and Getulio Vargas in Brazil in the early postwar period and, more recently, Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. As a modern populism in power, Trumpism represents an extreme form of postfascism, an antiliberal, and often anticonstitutional, authoritarian democracy with a political rationale of its own. This is a political formation with a mythical notion of the truth. Like the fascists, populists replace historical truth with fake ideas about a glorious past that their leaders promise to revive. This is the context for understanding the historical emptiness of an expression such as “Make America Great Again.” The leader restores to life a past that never existed. This was at the center of the fascist fabrication of the truth. It is also a crucial driver of modern right-wing populism.
   - Location: 1576-1582
   - Page: 103

9. Will the rise of leaders like Bolsonaro, Trump, and Orban lead to a twenty-first-century fascism? It is not yet clear. It is probably (and hopefully) unlikely that such a political turn will happen, but these politicians’ troubling embrace of increasingly extreme mythical lies should be a signal to those who believe in democracy that they must resist rising illiberalism and renewed fascist impulses not only with votes and demonstrations but also with a defense of history.

## Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, Third Edition
**Author:** Robert M. Sapolsky

### Highlights (36)

1. stress-response is about preparing the body for a major expenditure of energy—the canonical (or, perhaps, Cannonical) “fight-or-flight” response. Recent work by the psychologist Shelley Taylor of UCLA has forced people to rethink this. She suggests that the fight-or-flight response is what dealing with stress is about in males, and that it has been overemphasized as a phenomenon because of the long-standing bias among (mostly male) scientists to study males rather than females. Taylor argues convincingly that the physiology of the stress-response can be quite different in females, built around the fact that in most species, females are typically less aggressive than males, and that having dependent young often precludes the option of flight.
   - Location: 657-663
   - Page: 43

2. Taylor suggests that rather than the female stress-response being about fight-or-flight, it’s about “tend and befriend”—taking care of her young and seeking social affiliation.
   - Location: 663-664

3. Even after you control for adult body weight, low birth weight still predicts an increased risk of diabetes and hypertension.
   - Location: 1691-1691
   - Page: 111

4. These are big effects. When you compare those who were heaviest versus lightest at birth, you see an approximate eight-fold difference in the risk of pre-diabetes, and about an eighteen-fold difference in the risk of Metabolic syndrome.
   - Location: 1692-1693
   - Page: 111

5. This relationship between fetal nutritional events and lifelong risks of metabolic and cardiovascular disease was first described by the epidemiologist David Barker of Southampton Hospital in England, and now goes by the name Fetal Origins of Adult Disease (FOAD).
   - Location: 1695-1697
   - Page: 111

6. do non-nutritional stressors during pregnancy also induce FOAD-like effects? The answer is, yes. An extensive literature, stretching back decades, shows that stressing a female rat in any number of ways while she is pregnant will cause lifelong changes in the physiology of her offspring. Predictably, one set of changes involves glucocorticoid secretion. Once again, think of the fetal body “learning” about the outside world, this time along the lines of, “How stressful is it out there?” Fetuses can monitor signals of stress from the mother, insofar as glucocorticoids readily pass through to the fetal circulation, and lots of glucocorticoids “teach” the fetus that it is indeed a stressful world out there. The result? Be prepared for that stressful world: tend toward secreting excessive amounts of glucocorticoids. Prenatally stressed rats grow into adults with elevated glucocorticoid levels—depending on the study, elevated basal levels, a larger stress-response, and/or a sluggish recovery from the stress-response. The lifelong programming seems to be due to a permanent decrease in the number of receptors for glucocorticoids in one part of the brain. The brain region is involved in turning off this stress-response by inhibiting CRH release. Fewer glucocorticoid receptors there mean less sensitivity to the hormone’s signal, which means less effective reining in of subsequent glucocorticoid secretion. The result is a lifelong tendency toward elevated levels.

   - Page: 111

7. Touch is one of the central experiences of an infant. We readily think of stressors as consisting of various unpleasant things that can be done to an organism. Sometimes a stressor can be the failure to provide something essential, and the absence of touch is seemingly one of the most marked developmental stressors that we can suffer.
   - Location: 1921-1924

8. What the data show: the fewer social relationships a person has, the shorter his or her life expectancy, and the worse the impact of various infectious diseases. Relationships that are medically protective can take the form of marriage, contact with friends and extended family, church membership, or other group affiliations.
   - Location: 2806-2808
   - Page: 183

9. What are some of the disturbing implications of these findings? The first concerns the use by neurologists of synthetic versions of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, or prednisone) after someone has had a stroke. As we know from our introduction to glands and hormones in chapter 2, glucocorticoids are classic anti-inflammatory compounds and are used to reduce the edema, the damaging brain swelling that often occurs after a stroke. Glucocorticoids do wonders to block the edema that occurs after something like a brain tumor, but it turns out that they don’t do much for post-stroke edema. Worse, there’s increasing evidence that those famously anti-inflammatory compounds can actually be pro-inflammatory, worsening inflammation in the injured brain. Yet tons of neurologists still prescribe the stuff, despite decades-old warnings by the best people in the field and findings that the glucocorticoids tend to worsen the neurological outcome. So these recent findings add a voice to that caution—clinical use of glucocorticoids tends to be bad news for neurological diseases that involve a precarious hippocampus.

10. We humans also deal better with stressors when we have outlets for frustration—punch a wall, take a run, find solace in a hobby. We are even cerebral enough to imagine those outlets and derive some relief: consider the prisoner of war who spends hours imagining a golf game in tremendous detail. I have a friend who passed a prolonged and very stressful illness lying in bed with a mechanical pencil and a notepad, drawing topographic maps of imaginary mountain ranges and taking hikes through them. A central feature of an outlet being effective is if it distracts from the stressor. But, obviously, more important is that it also be something positive for you—a reminder that there is more to life than whatever is making you crazed and stressed at the time. The frustration-reducing effects of exercise provide an additional layer of benefit, one harking back to my dichotomy, repeated ad nauseam, between the zebra running for its life and the psychologically stressed human. The stress-response is about preparing your body for an explosive burst of energy consumption right now; psychological stress is about doing all the same things to your body for no physical reason whatsoever. Exercise finally provides your body for the outlet that it was preparing for.

11. when the rat gets the identical series of electric shocks and is upset, it can run across the cage, sit next to another rat and…bite the hell out of it. Stress-induced displacement of aggression: the practice works wonders at minimizing the stressfulness of a stressor. It’s a real primate specialty as well. A male baboon loses a fight. Frustrated, he spins around and attacks a subordinate male who was minding his own business. An extremely high percentage of primate aggression represents frustration displaced onto innocent bystanders. Humans are pretty good at it, too, and we have a technical way of describing the phenomenon in the context of stress-related disease: “He’s one of those guys who doesn’t get ulcers, he gives them.” Taking it out on someone else—how well it works at minimizing the impact of a stressor.
   - Location: 4368-4374
   - Page: 285

12. Social support An additional way we can interact with another organism to minimize the impact of a stressor on us is considerably more encouraging for the future of our planet than is displacement aggression. Rats only occasionally use it, but primates are great at it. Put a primate through something unpleasant: it gets a stress-response. Put it through the same stressor while in a room full of other primates and…it depends. If hose primates are strangers, the stress-response gets worse. But if they are friends, the stress-response is decreased. Social support networks—it helps to have a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, an ear to listen to you, someone to cradle you and to tell you it will be okay.
   - Location: 4374-4379
   - Page: 286

13. Social support is certainly protective for humans as well. This can be demonstrated even in transient instances of support. In a number of subtle studies, subjects were exposed to a stressor such as having to give a public speech or perform a mental arithmetic task, or having two strangers argue with them, with or without a supportive friend present. In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular stress-response. Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher glucocorticoid levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting cortisol levels.

14. Predictability Weiss’s rat studies uncovered another variable modulating the stress-response. The rat gets the same pattern of electric shocks, but this time, just before each shock, it hears a warning bell. Fewer ulcers. Predictability makes stressors less stressful.

15. Place two people in adjoining rooms, and expose both to intermittent noxious, loud noises; the person who has a button and believes that pressing it decreases the likelihood of more noise is less hypertensive. In one variant on this experiment, subjects with the button who did not bother to press it did just as well as those who actually pressed the button. Thus, the exercise of control is not critical; rather, it is the belief that you have it. An everyday example: airplanes are safer than cars, yet more of us are phobic about flying. Why? Because your average driver believes that he is a better-than-average driver, thus more in control. In an airplane, we have no control at all. My wife and I tease each other on plane flights, exchanging control: “Okay, you rest for a while, I’ll take over concentrating on keeping the pilot from having a stroke.”

16. The issue of control runs through the extensive literature on occupational stress. Sure, there are some jobs where stress comes in the form of someone having too much control and responsibility—that rare occupation where, over the course of an average workday, you might find yourself having to direct the landing pattern of an array of circling jumbo jets at the local airport, personally excise someone’s cerebral aneurysm, and make the final decision as to whether taffeta is going to be in at the fall runway show in Milan. For most, though, occupational stress is built more around lack of control, work life spent as a piece of the machine. Endless studies have shown that the link between occupational stress and increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is anchored in the killer combination of high demand and low control—you have to work hard, a lot is expected of you, and you have minimal control over the process. This is the epitome of the assembly line, the combination of stressors that makes for Marx’s alienation of the workers. The control element is more powerful than the demand one—low demand and low control is more damaging to one’s health than high demand and high control.

17. A perception of things worsening Yet another critical psychological variable in the stress-response has been uncovered. A hypothetical example: two rats get a series of electric shocks. On the first day, one gets ten shocks an hour; the other, fifty. Next day, both get twenty-five shocks an hour. Who becomes hypertensive? Obviously, the one going from ten to twenty-five. The other rat is thinking, “Twenty-five? Piece of cheese, no problem; I can handle that.” Given the same degree of disruption of allostasis, a perception that events are improving helps tremendously.
   - Location: 4498-4502
   - Page: 294

18. Sometimes these different variables conflict and it becomes a question as to which is more powerful. This often involves a dichotomy between control/predictability issues and the perception of whether things are improving or worsening. For example, someone unexpectedly wins the lottery big-time. Is this a stressor? It depends on what is more powerful, the beneficial “perception of things getting better” part or the stressful “lack of predictability” part. Not surprisingly, if the lottery win is big enough, most people’s psyches can handle some unpredictability. Nonetheless, some nonhuman primate studies in which rank was manipulated by the experimenters show that it can go in the other way, that if the change is sufficiently unexpected, it can be stressful, even if it is good change (and psychotherapy often must delve into the reasons why people sometimes find change for the good to be less desirable than persisting with a known misery).

19. These factors play a major role in explaining how we all go through lives full of stressors, yet differ so dramatically in our vulnerability to them.
   - Location: 4526-4527
   - Page: 296

20. warnings are less effective for very rare stressors (you don’t usually worry much about meteors) and very frequent ones (they approach being predictable even without the warning).
   - Location: 4550-4551
   - Page: 297

21. To summarize, stress-responses can be modulated or even caused by psychological factors, including loss of outlets for frustration and of social support, a perception of things worsening, and under some circumstances, a loss of control and of predictability. These ideas have vastly expanded our ability to answer the question: Why do only some of us get stress-related diseases?

22. After all the chapters on physiology, you can guess that we differ in how fast our adrenals make glucocorticoids, how many insulin receptors we have in our fat cells, the thickness of our stomach walls, and so on. But in addition to those physiological differences, we can now add another dimension. We differ in the psychological filters through which we perceive the stressors in our world. Two people participating in the same event—a long wait at the supermarket checkout, public speaking, parachuting out of an airplane—may differ dramatically in their psychological perception of the event. “Oh, I’ll just read a magazine while I wait” (outlet for frustration); “I’m nervous as hell, but by giving this after-dinner talk, I’m a shoo-in for that promotion” (things are getting better); “This is great—I’ve always wanted to try sky-diving” (this is something I’m in control of).

23. The defining feature of a major depression is loss of pleasure.
   - Location: 4640-4640

24. The main point of chapter 13 was that psychological factors can modulate stress-responses. Perceive yourself in a given situation to have expressive outlets, control, and predictive information, for example, and you are less likely to have a stress-response. What this chapter explores is the fact that people habitually differ in how they modulate their stress-responses with psychological variables. Your style, your temperament, your personality have much to do with whether you regularly perceive opportunities for control or safety signals when they are there, whether you consistently interpret ambiguous circumstances as implying good news or bad, whether you typically seek out and take advantage of social support. Some folks are good at modulating stress in these ways, and others are terrible. These fall within the larger category of what Richard Davidson has called “affective style.” And this turns out to be a very important factor in understanding why some people are more prone toward stress-related diseases than others.

25. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood of a bad outcome. Unlike depressives, the anxiety-prone person is still attempting to mobilize coping responses. But the discrepancy is the distorted belief that stressors are everywhere and perpetual, and that the only hope for safety is constant mobilization of coping responses. Life consists of the concrete, agitated present of solving a problem that someone else might not even consider to exist.* Awful. And immensely stressful. Not surprisingly, anxiety disorders are associated with chronically overactive stress-responses, and with increased risk of many of the diseases that fill the pages of this book
   - Location: 5478-5484

26. However, glucocorticoid excess is not the usual response. Instead, it’s too much sympathetic activation, an overabundance of circulating catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine).

27. As we saw in chapter 10, major stressors and glucocorticoids disrupt hippocampal function—the synapses aren’t able to do that long-term potentiation business, and the dendritic processes in neurons shrink. Remarkably, stress and glucocorticoids do just the opposite in the amygdala—synapses become more excitable, neurons grow more of the cables that connect the cells to each other. And if you artificially make the amygdala of a rat more excitable, the animal shows an anxiety-like disorder afterward. Joseph LeDoux of New York University, who pretty much put the amygdala on the map when it comes to anxiety, has constructed a remarkable model out of these findings. Suppose a major traumatic stressor occurs, of a sufficient magnitude to disrupt hippocampal function while enhancing amygdaloid function. At some later point, in a similar setting, you have an anxious, autonomic state, agitated and fearful, and you haven’t a clue why—this is because you never consolidated memories of the event via your hippocampus while your amygdala-mediated autonomic pathways sure as hell remember. This is a version of free-floating anxiety.

28. If you want to increase the odds of living a long and healthy life, don’t be poor. Poverty is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, ulcers, rheumatoid disorders, psychiatric diseases, and a number of types of cancer, just to name a few.* It is associated with higher rates of people judging themselves to be of poor health, of infant mortality, and of mortality due to all causes. Moreover, lower SES predicts lower birth weight, after controlling for body size—and we know from chapter 6 the lifelong effects of low birth weight. In other words, be born poor but hit the lottery when you’re three weeks old, spend the rest of your life double-dating with Donald Trump, and you’re still going to have a statistical increase in some realms of disease risk for the rest of your life. Is

29. This brings us to a critical point in this field—the SES/health gradient is not really about a distribution that bottoms out at being poor. It’s not about being poor. It’s about feeling poor, which is to say, it’s about feeling poorer than others around you.
   - Location: 6372-6374
   - Page: 416

30. So it’s not about being poor. It’s about feeling poor. What’s the difference? Adler shows that subjective SES is built around education, income, and occupational position (in other words, the building blocks of subjective SES), plus satisfaction with standard of living and feeling of financial security about the future. Those last two measures are critical. Income may tell you something (but certainly not everything) about SES; satisfaction with standard of living is the world of people who are poor and happy and zillionaires who are still grasping for more. All that messy stuff that dominates this book. And what is “feelings about financial security” tapping into? Anxiety So SES reality plus your satisfaction with that SES plus your confidence about how predictable your SES is are collectively better predictors of health than SES alone. This is not a hard and fast rule, and Adler’s most recent work shows that subjective SES is not necessarily that great of a predictor in certain ethnic groups—stay tuned for more, no doubt. But overall, this strikes me as immensely impressive—when you’re past the realm of worrying about having adequate shelter and food, being poor is not as bad for you as feeling poor.

31. Income inequality predicts mortality rates across all ages (except the elderly) in the United States, whether you consider this at the level of states or cities. In a world of science often filled with wishy-washy data, the effect is extremely reliable—income inequality across American states is a really strong predictor of mortality rates among working men. When you compare the most egalitarian state, New Hampshire, with the least egalitarian, Louisiana, the latter has about a 60 percent higher mortality rate.* Finally, Canada is both markedly more egalitarian and healthier than the United States—despite being a “poorer” country.

32. thanks to urbanization, mobility, and the media that makes for a global village, something absolutely unprecedented can now occur—we can now be made to feel poor, or poorly about ourselves, by people we don’t even know. You can feel impoverished by the clothes of someone you pass in a midtown crowd, by the unseen driver of a new car on the freeway, by Bill Gates on the evening news, even by a fictional character in a movie. Our perceived SES may arise mostly out of our local community, but our modern world makes it possible to have our noses rubbed in it by a local community that stretches around the globe.

33. Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time. Hunter-gatherers have thousands of wild sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight. Agriculture allowed for the stockpiling of surplus resources and thus, inevitably, the unequal stockpiling of them—stratification of society and the invention of classes. Thus, it allowed for the invention of poverty. I think that the punch line of the primate-human difference is that when humans invented poverty, they came up with a way of subjugating the low-ranking like nothing ever before seen in the primate world.

34. Awhile back some researchers got an utterly mad idea, the thought of frothing lunatics. Why not give the painkillers to the patients and let them decide when they need medication? You can just imagine the apoplexy that mainstream medicine had over that one—patients will overdose, become addicts, you can’t let patients do that. It was tried with cancer patients and postsurgical patients, and it turned out that the patients did just fine when they self-medicated. In fact, the total amount of painkillers consumed decreased. Why should consumption go down? Because when you are lying there in bed, in pain, uncertain of the time, uncertain if the nurse has heard your call or will have time to respond, uncertain of everything, you are asking for painkillers not only to stop the pain but also to stop the uncertainty. Reinstitute control and predictability, give the patient the knowledge that the medication is there for the instant that the pain becomes too severe, and the pain often becomes far more manageable.

35. I had a highly orthodox religious upbringing and believed devoutly. Except that now I am an atheist, have no room in my life for spirituality of any kind, and believe that religion is phenomenally damaging. Except that I wish I could be religious. Except that it makes no sense to me and I’m baffled by people who believe. Except that I’m also moved by them. So I’m confused.

## Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference
**Author:** Cordelia Fine

### Highlights (7)

1. the critical idea that the psyche is ‘not a discrete entity packed in the brain. Rather, it is a structure of psychological processes that are shaped by and thus closely attuned to the culture that surrounds them.’38 We tend not to think about ourselves this way, and it’s easy to underestimate the impact of what is outside the mind on what takes place inside.
   - Location: 259-262
   - Page: 17

2. As Harvard University psychologist Mahzarin Banaji puts it, there is no ‘bright line separating self from culture’, and the culture in which we develop and function enjoys a ‘deep reach’ into our minds.
   - Location: 264-266
   - Page: 18

3. we can’t understand gender differences in female and male minds – the minds that are the source of our thoughts, feelings, abilities, motivations, and behaviour – without understanding how psychologically permeable is the skull that separates the mind from the sociocultural context in which it operates. When the environment makes gender salient, there is a ripple effect on the mind. We start to think of ourselves in terms of our gender, and stereotypes and social expectations become more prominent in the mind. This can change self-perception, alter interests, debilitate or enhance ability, and trigger unintentional discrimination. In other words, the social context influences who you are, how you think and what you do. And these thoughts, attitudes and behaviours of yours, in turn, become part of the social context. It’s intimate. It’s messy. And it demands a different way of thinking about gender.

4. The Australian writer Helen Garner noted that one can either ‘think of people as discrete bubbles floating past each other and sometimes colliding, or … see them overlap, seep into each other’s lives, penetrate the fabric of each other’.23 Research supports the latter view. The boundary of the self-concept is permeable to other people’s conceptions of you (or, somewhat more accurately, your perception of their perception of you).
   - Location: 437-440
   - Page: 29

5. Stacey Sinclair and her colleagues have shown in a string of experiments that people socially ‘tune’ their self-evaluations to blend with the opinion of the self held by others. With a particular person in mind, or in anticipation of interacting with them, self-conception adjusts to create a shared reality.

6. The 2D:4D digit ratio is the ratio of the length of the second (index) finger and the fourth (ring) finger. This ratio is, on average, different in men and women. (Men tend to have longer ring fingers relative to their index fingers, while women’s index fingers are about the same length as, or slightly longer than, their ring fingers.)

7. The circuits of the brain are quite literally a product of your physical, social and cultural environment, as well as your behaviour and thoughts. What we experience and do creates neural activity that can alter the brain, either directly or through changes in gene expression. This neuroplasticity means that, as Kaiser puts it, the social phenomenon of gender ‘comes into the brain’ and ‘becomes part of our cerebral biology’.11

## So You Think You Can Think
**Author:** Christopher W. DiCarlo

### Highlights (27)

1. So what is an argument? An argument is formed when a person makes a claim that is further supported by another statement. For example, when I state, “I believe Justin Bieber is the greatest pop star of all time,” I am making a claim. However, this claim by itself is not an argument. It requires further support from at least one other statement. For example, I might believe Justin Bieber is the greatest pop star of all time because of his magnificent singing voice. If that were the case, then I would have an argument. My main point, or conclusion, is that Justin Bieber is the greatest pop star of all time. My supporting reason for believing this, or my premise, is that he has a magnificent singing voice. So my argument looks like this: Justin Bieber is the greatest pop star of all time because of his magnificent singing voice. Now, whether or not this is a good argument or whether or not you agree with this argument is not the point. The point is that I now have an argument, whereas before I simply had a statement. And my argument, just like all arguments, is always made up of two parts: my main point, or what is formally called the conclusion, and my reasons for believing my main point, or what are formally called premises. If you want to be better understood, then you need to put your ideas into the form of arguments. Likewise, if you want to better understand what someone means, try to understand their ideas in the form of arguments. An argument is essentially the way in which we put together or structure our ideas, beliefs, or opinions so that we are more clearly understood. So the structure of every argument takes the following form: Premise(s) + Conclusion = Argument

2. There are several universal criteria that make up the foundation. These are consistency, simplicity, relevance, reliability, and sufficiency.
   - Location: 375-376
   - Page: 25

3. The Law of Identity This is the first and most basic law. It states that x = x, where x refers in both cases to the same thing at the same time and in the same respect.
   - Location: 463-464
   - Page: 31

4. The Law of Noncontradiction The second law that Aristotle developed to demonstrate the importance of consistency maintains that either a state of being or a statement and its negation cannot both be true.
   - Location: 485-487
   - Page: 32

5. The Law of Excluded Middle With this particular law, Aristotle said that any meaningful claim that one thinks or any natural state of being must be either true or false. In other words, there is literally no middle ground.
   - Location: 495-497
   - Page: 33

6. Sometimes referred to as parsimony, simplicity is universally valued as a criterion to support premises because if we can present an argument that accomplishes just as much but with fewer premises, it tends to be more highly valued. Often referred to as Occam’s razor—named after William of Occam, a fourteenth-century Franciscan friar and Scholastic philosopher—the criterion is often best summed up in his famous saying: “Do not multiply entities beyond necessity.”10 What Occam meant by this is that you really don’t need more premises than are necessary to responsibly support your conclusion and satisfy the foundational criteria. One might even say that Occam was the originator of the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid).
   - Location: 563-569
   - Page: 37

7. Reliability The manner in which information is attained and used as premises to support a conclusion is extremely important. Attaining dependable, factual information is critical in the continued support of one’s conclusion. Reliability is a universal criterion that demands that we attain our information from trustworthy sources and that we do not shirk our responsibility in this regard.
   - Location: 577-580
   - Page: 38

8. Relevance It seems blatantly obvious that premises should be relevant to the support of a conclusion. Yet there are many ways in which people introduce irrelevant premises into an argument in the guise of presenting relevant points. A fallacy called a red herring is a fallacy of improper relevance (something we will look at in more detail in chapter 6). One commits a red herring fallacy when one attempts to circumvent addressing or responding to the topic at hand by discussing a subject or subjects that have nothing to do with the currently discussed topic.
   - Location: 604-608
   - Page: 40

9. Sufficiency The last foundational universal criterion we need to consider is sufficiency. We all have some idea of what it means for something to be sufficient. Sufficiency requires enough of something to satisfy some condition, want, goal, and so on.

12. It is important to note that, in all of the above examples, the premises do not necessarily have to be true for the argument to be valid. For in each case, their truth is assumed. In other words, we assume that if the premises are true, the conclusion has to follow.
   - Location: 681-682
   - Page: 45

13. Unlike deductive reasoning, the conclusions arrived at using inductive reasoning are not logically valid but are considered to be reasonable, warranted, or probable. And unlike deductive reasoning, which uses pure reason and logic to deduce the conclusion based on a series of premises, inductive reasoning relies heavily on what is called “empirical evidence.” This is evidence that is attained through the use of our five senses: sight, sound, taste, hearing, and touch. We just saw that, with deductive reasoning, if the premises are assumed to be true and follow specific forms, then the conclusion must logically follow. With inductive reasoning, human empirical observations through the use of our five senses provide probable conclusions according to statistical generalizations.

15. Abductive Reasoning: The Semmelweis Reflex Unlike either deductive or inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning is interesting and unique. It is sometimes referred to as “reasoning to the best explanation.” What that means is that when there isn’t enough evidence to definitively conclude and understand a particular aspect of the world, abductive reasoning is often used to provide a hypothesis that makes sense for now.

16. There are many different types of biases, but they all generally fall under two categories: biological and cultural. Biological biases include factors such as genetic and epigenetic influences, neuropsychological factors, emotions, age, health, and sex. Cultural biases involve constraints and influences such as family upbringing, ethnicity, religion, geographic location, friends, education, and the media.

24. Information that runs counter to our most cherished beliefs often generates what is known as cognitive dissonance. In other words, as a species, we tend to favor very highly our own current beliefs, so we tend to pay more attention to information that proves to us or confirms that we are on the right track in believing this information. As we have seen, this is often referred to as confirmation bias: the act of looking only for information that confirms one’s current biased views while ignoring counterfactual information. The act of acknowledging only such information because it confirms one’s already established bias is known as an echo chamber. As long as one stays in the echo chamber, one cannot witness any contradictory or counterfactual information that might possibly raise any level of doubt in one’s current beliefs. Counterfactual information to one’s most cherished views can often bring about cognitive dissonance or a feeling of unease, or what the ancient skeptics called disquietude. In order for a person to escape this feeling of cognitive dissonance, they have various options available to them. For example, they can simply ignore it, or they can try to justify it or explain it in ways that they find satisfactory.

## The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology
**Author:** Steven Laureys;Giulio Tononi

### Highlights (18)

1. consciousness does allow us to know of our own existence and of the existence of objects and events, inside and outside our organism.
   - Location: 567-568
   - Page: 37

2. The sign of consciousness we should consider first is wakefulness. If we disregard the somewhat paradoxical situation of dream sleep, one cannot be conscious and asleep. Wakefulness is easy to establish on the basis of a few objective signs: subjects should open their eyes upon request; the muscular tone should be compatible with movements against gravity; and there should be a characteristic awake electroencephalography (EEG) pattern. However, although normal consciousness requires wakefulness, the presence of wakefulness does not guarantee consciousness. Patients with impaired consciousness in conditions such as vegetative state, epileptic automatisms, and akinetic mutism, are technically awake but cannot be considered conscious
   - Location: 572-577
   - Page: 38

3. Second, conscious persons exhibit background emotions. The term emotion usually conjures up the primary emotions (e.g., fear, anger, sadness, happiness, disgust) or the social emotions (e.g., embarrassment, guilt, compassion), but the phenotypes of emotion also include background emotions, which occur in continual form when the organism is not engaged in either primary or social emotions. Background emotions are expressed in configurations of body movement and suggest to the observer states such as fatigue or energy; discouragement or enthusiasm; malaise or well-being; anxiety or relaxation. Telltale signals include the overall body posture and the range of motion of the limbs relative to the trunk; the spatial profile of limb movements; the speed of motion; the congruence of movements occurring in different body tiers; and, perhaps most importantly, the animation of the face. When we observe someone with intact consciousness, well before any words are spoken or major gestures produced, we find ourselves presuming the subject’s state of mind. Correct or not, those presumptions are largely based on preverbal emotional signals available in the subject’s behaviour. The absence of background emotions usually betrays impairments of consciousness.
   - Location: 578-586
   - Page: 38

4. Third, conscious subjects exhibit attention. They orient themselves towards objects and concentrate on them as needed. Eyes, head, neck, torso, and arms move about in a coordinated pattern which establishes an unequivocal relationship between subjects and certain stimuli in their surround. The mere presence of attention towards an external object usually signifies the presence of consciousness, but there are exceptions. Patients in states of akinetic mutism, whose consciousness is impaired, can pay transient attention to a salient object or event, for example, a phone ringing, a tray with food, an observer calling their name. Attention only denotes the presence of consciousness when it can be sustained over a substantial period of time and is focused on the objects or events that must be considered for behaviour to be appropriate in a given context. This period of time is measured in the order of minutes rather than seconds.

5. Lack of attention towards an external object may indicate that attention is being directed towards an internally represented mental object and does not necessarily denote impaired consciousness, as in absentmindedness. However, sustained failure of attention as happens in drowsiness, confusional states, or stupor, is associated with the dissolution of consciousness. Attention is disrupted in coma, VS, and general anaesthesia.

6. Fourth, conscious persons exhibit purposeful behaviour. The presence of adequate and purposeful behaviour is easy to establish in patients who can converse with the observer. When there are impairments of communication, however, the observation requires more detail. Purposeful behaviour towards a stimulus suggests a recognizable plan that could only have been formulated by an organism cognizant of its immediate past, of its present, and of anticipated future conditions. The sustained purposefulness and adequateness of behaviour require consciousness even if consciousness does not guarantee purposeful and adequate behaviour.

7. consciousness requires something beyond the production of such multiple images. It requires the creation of a sense of self in the act of knowing, a second step that follows that of creating mental images for objects and events. This second step delivers information about our own mind and organism. It creates knowledge to the effect that we have a mind and that the contents of our mind are shaped in a particular perspective, namely that of our own organism. This second step in the generation of consciousness allows us to construct not just the mental images of objects and events, for example the temporally and spatially unified images of persons, places, and of their components and relationships, but also the mental images which automatically convey the sense of a self in the act of knowing. In other words, the second step consists of generating the appearance of an owner and observer of the mind, within that very same mind [1, 2]. How is this sense of self constructed by the brain? In answering this question, it is indispensable to note that consciousness is not only about the representation of objects and events, but also about the representation of the organism it belongs to, as the latter interacts with objects and events. The sense of our organism in the act of knowing endows us with the feeling of ownership of the objects to be known. We have suggested that this sense of self is newly created for each moment in time; conscious individuals continuously generate ‘pulses of consciousness’ which bring together organism and object, multiple and consecutive periods of mental knowledge along with the external behaviours that accompany this process.

8. working definition describes consciousness as a momentary creation of neural patterns which describe a relation between the organism, on the one hand, and an object or event, on the other.
   - Location: 639-641
   - Page: 42

9. This composite of neural patterns describes a state that, for lack of a better word, we call the self. That state is the key to subjectivity. The mental states which inhere in the processing of neural patterns related to all sorts of objects and events are now imbued with neural patterns and corresponding mental states which correspond to the relationship between the organism and objects/events. The definition also specifies that the creation of self neural patterns is accompanied by characteristic observable behaviours. In conclusion, consciousness must be considered from two standpoints: the external (behavioural) and the internal (cognitive, mental).

10. From the external standpoint, the human organism is said to be conscious when it exhibits signs of wakefulness, background emotions, sustained attention towards objects and events in its environment, and sustained, adequate, and purposeful behaviour relative to those objects and events. From the internal standpoint, a human organism is said to be conscious when its mental state represents objects and events in relation to itself, that is when the representation of objects and events is accompanied by the sense that the organism is the perceiving agent.
   - Location: 645-649

11. In the absence of the above collection of behavioural signs, it is not permissible to say that a person is conscious unless the person reports by gesture, words, or some other behavioural manifestation that in spite of the absence of such signs, there is in fact a conscious mind at work. This is precisely the situation of locked-in patients, who exhibit, via a minimal amount of movement, unequivocal evidence of conscious mental activity.

12. ‘core consciousness’, conforms to the concept of consciousness described just above, and provides the organism with a sense of self about one moment, now, and about one place, here.

13. ‘extended consciousness’, provides the organism with an elaborate sense of self and places that self in individual historical time, in a perspective of both the lived past and the anticipated future.

16. core consciousness is not equivalent to wakefulness or low-level attention, it requires both to operate normally,
   - Location: 688-689
   - Page: 45

17. Core consciousness is also not equivalent to working memory although it is related to it. As we have seen, core consciousness is newly and individually generated for each object or event. On the other hand, working memory is vital for the process of extended consciousness, because a percept has to be held active over a certain amount of time in order to be placed into the rich context extended consciousness endows it with.
   - Location: 689-692
   - Page: 45

18. Some of these functions (wakefulness, image-making, attention) operate in concert to permit core consciousness; others (working memory, conventional memory, language, and reasoning) assist extended consciousness.

## Calling Bullshit
**Author:** Carl T. Bergstrom;Jevin D. West

### Highlights (65)

1. If I deliberately lead you to draw the wrong conclusions by saying things that are technically not untrue, I am paltering.
   - Location: 216-217
   - Page: 15

2. Paltering offers a level of plausible deniability—or at least deniability. Getting caught paltering can hurt your reputation, but most people consider it less severe an offense than outright lying.

3. Within linguistics, this notion of implied meaning falls under the area of pragmatics. Philosopher of language H. P. Grice coined the term implicature to describe what a sentence is being used to mean, rather than what it means literally. Implicature allows us to communicate efficiently. If you ask where you can get a cup of coffee and I say, “There’s a diner just down the block,” you interpret my response as an answer to your question. You assume that the diner is open, that it serves coffee, and so forth. I don’t have to say all of that explicitly.
   - Location: 229-233
   - Page: 15

4. An important genre of bullshit known as weasel wording uses the gap between literal meaning and implicature to avoid taking responsibility for things.

5. We tell stories to create impressions of ourselves in the eyes of others. This impulse drives a lot of bullshit production. When you’re talking about a crazy adventure you had on a backpacking trip through Asia, your story doesn’t actually need to be true to create the impression you are seeking. You often don’t care one way or the other. Your story just needs to be interesting, impressive, or engaging.
   - Location: 268-271

6. This kind of bullshit has become an art form in the so-called attention economy.
   - Location: 271-272
   - Page: 18

7. Perhaps the most important principle in bullshit studies is Brandolini’s principle. Coined by Italian software engineer Alberto Brandolini in 2014, it states: “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than [that needed] to produce it.”
   - Location: 276-278

9. Prior to the Internet, newspapers and magazines made money by selling subscriptions.*2 Subscribing to a periodical, you embarked on a long-term relationship. You cared about the quality of information a source provided, its accuracy, and its relevance to your daily life. To attract subscribers and keep them, publishers provided novel and well-vetted information.
   - Location: 485-488
   - Page: 32

10. The Internet news economy is driven by clicks. When you click on a link and view a website, your click generates advertising revenue for the site’s owner. The Internet site is not necessarily designed to perpetuate a long-term relationship; it is designed to make you click, now. Quality of information and accuracy are no longer as important as sparkle.

11. Entrepreneur Steve Rayson looked at 100 million articles published in 2017 to determine what phrases were common in the headlines of articles that were widely shared. Their results will make you gasp in surprise—unless you’ve spent a few minutes on the Internet at some point in the past few years. The study found that the most successful headlines don’t convey facts, they promise you an emotional experience. The most common phrase among successful Facebook headlines, by nearly twofold, is “will make you,” as in “will break your heart,” “will make you fall in love,” “will make you look twice,” or “will make you gasp in surprise” as above. This phrase is also highly successful on Twitter. Other top phrases include “make you cry,” “give you goosebumps,” and “melt your heart.” Intellectual experiences cannot compete. Pause for a moment and think about what a huge shift this represents. Can you imagine The New York Times or your local newspaper with headlines that told you how you’d feel about each story, but not what the story actually entailed?
   - Location: 508-516
   - Page: 34

12. Headlines once aimed to concisely convey the essence of a story: “Kennedy Is Killed by Sniper as He Rides in Car in Dallas; Johnson Sworn In on Plane.” “Men Walk on Moon. Astronauts Land on Plain; Collect Rocks, Plant Flag.” “East Germany Opens Wall and Borders, Allowing Citizens to Travel Freely to the West.” With click-driven advertising, if a headline tells too much, there is little incentive to click on the story. Headlines now go through contortions not to tell you what the story says.

13. In short, the algorithms driving social media content are bullshitters. They don’t care about the messages they carry. They just want our attention and will tell us whatever works to capture it.

16. In 2017, Facebook admitted that over the past two years, 126 million US users—half of the adult population and about three-quarters of its US user base—had been exposed to Russian propaganda on the site. More than one hundred thirty thousand messages from these accounts were designed to deepen preexisting ideological divides within the US, and to seed mistrust between neighbors. They focused on emotionally charged issues such as race relations, gun rights, border security, welfare, and abortion, and played both sides of each topic to reach the largest possible audience. The goal was to amplify the loudest and most extreme voices in each political camp, while drowning out the more reasonable and productive discussants. When the divide between political factions grows deep enough, conversations between them stop. Our trust in people and institutions erodes. We lose faith in our ability to make collective decisions. Ultimately we start to question the democratic process itself. While we think of propaganda as designed to convince people of specific untruths, much modern propaganda has a different aim. The “firehose strategy” is designed to leave the audience disoriented and despairing of ever being able to separate truth from falsehood. Social media makes it easy to broadcast large volumes of disinformation at high rates across multiple channels. This is part of the firehose strategy. The other part is to deliberately eschew consistency. Rather than being careful to convey only a single cohesive story, the aim is to confuse readers with a large number of mutually contradictory stories. In 2016, chess grand master Garry Kasparov summarized this approach in a post on Twitter: “The point of modern propaganda isn’t only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.”

17. In the final days of the 2016 US election, Barack Obama talked extensively about the fake news factories in Macedonia. The people running these factories—often teenagers—created at least 140 popular fake news websites during the election. When a story went viral, it generated huge advertising revenues for the site owners. Some of them were making in excess of $5,000 per month, compared with the average Macedonian monthly salary of $371. The teens writing these stories didn’t care whether Trump or Clinton won; they cared only about clicks. The most shared fake news story in that whole election proclaimed that “Pope Francis Shocks the World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.” This story was created by a group of teenagers in Macedonia, under the aegis of WT05 News, and received nearly a million engagements on Facebook. To put that in perspective, the top New York Times article during this same period received 370,000 engagements.

18. To raise public awareness, we developed a website called WhichFaceIsReal.com. A real photograph of a real person is paired with a computer-generated image of someone who does not exist. Your aim is to guess which is which. More than a million people have played the game on our website and the results show just how good the fakes are. People do not do much better than chance when they start playing, and even with lots of practice people still are fooled one time in five.

19. Similar machine learning algorithms are able to “voiceshop,” generating fake audio and video that are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. By synthesizing audio from previous recordings and grafting expressions and facial movements from a person acting as model onto the visage of a target, these so-called deepfake videos can make it look like anyone is doing or saying anything.

20. Our society adjusted to the anonymity afforded by an Internet on which “nobody knows you’re a dog.” And we adjusted to a Photoshop world in which pictures do lie. How? In a word, we triangulate. We no longer trust a single message, a single image, a single claim. We look for independent witnesses who can confirm testimony. We seek multiple images from multiple vantage points. Society will adjust similarly to a world of deepfakes and whatever reality-bending technologies follow.

21. Every generation has looked back on the past with nostalgia for a simpler and more honest time. We may have greater than usual cause for nostalgia. The Internet has brought about a sea change in the way that information is created, sorted, discovered, spread, and consumed. While this has had a decentralizing effect on the dissemination of information, it has come with a cost. Bullshit spreads more easily in a massively networked, click-driven social media world than in any previous social environment. We have to be alert for bullshit in everything we read.

22. Bullshit involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade or impress an audience by distracting, overwhelming, or intimidating them with a blatant disregard for truth, logical coherence, or what information is actually being conveyed. The key elements of this definition are that bullshit bears no allegiance to conveying the truth, and that the bullshitter attempts to conceal this fact behind some type of rhetorical veil.

23. The central theme of this book is that you usually don’t have to open the analytic black box in order to call bullshit on the claims that come out of it. Any black box used to generate bullshit has to take in data and spit results out, like the diagram on this page. Most often, bullshit arises either because there are biases in the data that get fed into the black box, or because there are obvious problems with the results that come out.
   - Location: 819-824
   - Page: 54

24. If the data that go into the analysis are flawed, the specific technical details of the analysis don’t matter. One can obtain stupid results from bad data without any statistical trickery. And this is often how bullshit arguments are created, deliberately or otherwise. To catch this sort of bullshit, you don’t have to unpack the black box. All you have to do is think carefully about the data that went into the black box and the results that came out. Are the data unbiased, reasonable, and relevant to the problem at hand? Do the results pass basic plausibility checks? Do they support whatever conclusions are drawn?

25. people’s heights and weights are associated. If I tell you my friend is six feet four inches tall, you can safely guess that he will weigh more than many of my other acquaintances. If I tell you another friend is five feet one inch tall, you can guess that she is probably lighter than average. In common language, we sometimes refer to associations as correlations. Someone might say, “I heard that your personality is correlated with your astrological sign. Aries are bold, whereas Taurus seek security.” (This would be bullshit, but never mind that.) When scientists and statisticians talk about a correlation, however, they are usually talking about a linear correlation.

28. But if one is not careful, looking at events chronologically can be misleading. Just because A happens before B does not mean that A causes B—even when A and B are associated. This mistake is so common and has been around for so long that it has a Latin name: post hoc ergo propter hoc. Translated, this means something like “after this, therefore because of it.”
   - Location: 1181-1184
   - Page: 78

29. Linear correlations require variables with numerical values such as height and weight, whereas associations can occur between categorical values such as “favorite color” and “favorite ice cream flavor,” or between numerical variables. Correlations are associations, but not all associations are correlations. Moreover, values can be highly predictable without being linearly correlated. For example, consider pairs of numbers {x, sin(x)}. If we know x, we can predict exactly what sin(x) will be, but the correlation coefficient—a measure of linear correlation—between these numbers is zero across a full-cycle sine wave.

31. association does not imply causation either. That said, it is worth noticing that although correlation does not imply causation, causation does imply association. Causation may not generate a linear correlation, but it will generate some sort of association.

The author of the 2013 article speculated that in a very short amount of time, these brain-like machines “will make possible a new generation of artificial intelligence [AI] systems that will perform some functions that humans do with ease: see, speak, listen, navigate, manipulate and control.” It was as if the original writers outslept Rip Van Winkle, waking fifty-five years later to write the same article about the same technology using the same superlatives.

40. John Zech and colleagues at California Pacific Medical Center wanted to investigate how well neural networks could detect pathologies such as pneumonia and cardiomegaly—enlarged heart—using X-ray images. The team found that their algorithms performed relatively well in hospitals where they were trained, but poorly elsewhere. It turned out that the machine was cueing on parts of the images that had nothing to do with the heart or lungs. For example, X-ray images produced by a portable imaging device had the word PORTABLE printed in the upper right corner—and the algorithm learned that this is a good indicator that a patient has pneumonia. Why? Because portable X-ray machines are used for the most severely ill patients, who cannot easily go to the radiology department of the hospital. Using this cue improved prediction in the original hospital. But it was of little practical value. It had little to do with identifying pneumonia, didn’t cue in on anything doctors didn’t already know, and wouldn’t work in a different hospital that used a different type of portable X-ray machine.

42. The more variables you add, the more training data you need. We talked earlier about the cost of obtaining good training data. If you have ten thousand genes you want to incorporate into your model, good luck in finding the millions of example patients that you will need to have any chance of making reliable predictions. This problem with adding additional variables is referred to as the curse of dimensionality. If you add enough variables into your black box, you will eventually find a combination of variables that performs well—but it may do so by chance. As you increase the number of variables you use to make your predictions, you need exponentially more data to distinguish true predictive capacity from luck.

44. The rest of us—including every living scientist we know—are epistemically sullied. We act from the same human motivations as everyone else. This doesn’t mean that scientists are irresponsible, untrustworthy, or unethical; it just means that they have other interests beyond the pure quest for understanding. To understand how science works and where things can go wrong, we need to understand what these interests are.

47. Its findings should tell us something we did not previously know about the world—even if they do so merely by strengthening the support for a previous argument. The article should relate to ongoing research questions that have already been deemed of interest to the community, or make a compelling case for the importance of a new research question. To be complete, a paper ought to describe the experiment or other work in enough detail that another expert in the field could reproduce the findings. Obviously a paper should not misreport findings, draw unfounded inferences, or make false claims.

53. Scientific results could be irreproducible for a number of reasons. Perhaps the most obvious is outright fraud. If researchers have faked their data, we wouldn’t expect to be able to replicate their experiments. Fraud generates enormous publicity, which can give a misleading impression of its frequency.*2 But outright fraud is rare. It might explain why one study in a thousand can’t be replicated. It doesn’t explain why half of the results in fields are irreproducible. How then do we explain the replication crisis? To answer this, it is helpful to take a detour and look at a statistic known as a p-value.

54. You and the prosecutor have each stressed different conditional probabilities. A conditional probability is the chance that something is true, given other information. The prosecutor asks what the chance is that there is a false match, given an innocent person chosen at random.*4 We can write this as P(match|innocent). You are asking the converse: What is the chance that your client is innocent, given that there is a match, which we write as P(innocent|match). People often assume that these two probabilities must be the same, but that is not true. In our example, P(match|innocent) = 1/10,000,000 whereas P(innocent|match) = 5/6.

56. We can think of our task as trying to distinguish between two different hypotheses. The first, called the null hypothesis and written H0, is that Carl’s guesses were no better than random. The second, called the alternative hypothesis and written H1, is that Carl was able to identify the cards at a rate higher than chance.

57. The p-value associated with the experiment tells us how likely it is that by guessing at random Carl would get 19 or more cards correct. We can use statistical theory to calculate the appropriate p-value. In this particular case, it turns out that there is only a 4.3 percent chance that one would do this well at random,*5 so we say that the p-value is 0.043. So guessing at random, 95.7 percent of the time one would fail to get 19 or more correct. But the key thing to notice here is that this does not mean that we are 95.7 percent sure that H0 is false. These are two very different claims—and

58. The fundamental problem here is that the chance that a paper gets published is not independent of the p-value that it reports. As a consequence, we slam head-on into a selection bias problem. The set of published papers represents a biased sample of the set of all experiments conducted. Significant results are strongly overrepresented in the literature, and nonsignificant results are underrepresented. The data from experiments that generated nonsignificant results end up in scientists’ file cabinets (or file systems, these days). This is what is sometimes called the file drawer effect.

   - Page: 229

59. If scientific papers were published irrespective of p-values, these values would remain useful measures of the degree of statistical support for rejecting a null hypothesis. But since journals have a strong preference for papers with p-values below 0.05, p-values no longer serve their original purpose.

60. So how do you tell whether a scientific article is legitimate? The first thing to recognize is that any scientific paper can be wrong. That’s the nature of science; nothing is above questioning. No matter where a paper is published, no matter who wrote it, no matter how well supported its arguments may be, any paper can be wrong. Every hypothesis, every set of data, every claim, and every conclusion is subject to reexamination in light of future evidence.
   - Location: 3732-3735
   - Page: 244

61. The second thing to understand is the role of peer review. While it’s an important part of the scientific process, peer review does not guarantee that published papers are correct. Peer reviewers carefully read a paper to make sure its methods are reasonable and its reasoning logical. They make sure a paper accurately represents what it adds to the literature, and that its conclusions follow from its results. They suggest ways to improve a paper, and sometimes recommend additional experiments. But peer reviewers can make mistakes and, more important, peer reviewers cannot possibly check every aspect of the work. Peer reviewers don’t redo the laboratory experiments, repeat the field observations, rewrite the computer code, rederive all of the mathematics, or even delve too deeply into the data in most cases. Though helpful, peer review cannot catch every innocent mistake, let alone uncover well-concealed acts of scientific misconduct.
   - Location: 3740-3747
   - Page: 244

62. Usually the best you can hope to do is to determine that a paper is legitimate. By legitimate, we mean that a paper is (1) written in good faith, (2) carried out using appropriate methodologies, and (3) taken seriously by the relevant scientific community.

63. Pay attention to where information comes from. If you find a piece of candy lying in the street, you are not going to eat it or share it with your friends. Unsourced information is the same. All too often, someone we don’t know posts a factoid or statistic or data graphic on social media without listing its source—and we share it anyway.

64. Take advantage of fact-checking organizations. If you come across a wild story online, confirm it by visiting a fact-checking website such as Snopes.com, PolitiFact.com, or FactCheck.org. If the story is not yet documented at these websites, ask them to fact-check it. They learn what stories need to be verified or debunked from users like you.

## The Invention of Nature: Alexander Von Humboldt's New World
**Author:** Andrea Wulf

### Highlights (5)

1. Cosmos was like a ‘sword in the breast that now has to be drawn’, he said, and the ‘opus of my life’. The title, Humboldt explained, came from the Greek word κόσμος – Kosmos – which meant ‘beauty’ and ‘order’, and which had also been applied to the universe as an ordered system. Humboldt now used it, as he said, as a catchphrase to express and encapsulate ‘both heaven and earth’. And so, in 1834, the very year that the term ‘scientist’1 was first coined, heralding the beginning of the professionalization of the sciences and the hardening lines between different scientific disciplines, Humboldt began a book that did exactly the opposite.

2. As the revolutionaries in Berlin took control of the city, a frightened Friedrich Wilhelm IV conceded and promised a constitution and a national parliament. On 19 March he agreed to withdraw his troops. That night the streets of Berlin were illuminated and the people celebrated their victory. Instead of gunshots, there was singing and jubilation. On 21 March, only three days after the fighting had begun, the king displayed his defeat symbolically by riding through Berlin draped in the black, red and gold colours of the revolutionaries.

5. Another reason why Humboldt has faded from our collective memory – at least in Britain and the United States – is the anti-German sentiment that came with the First World War. In a country such as Britain, where even the royal family felt they had to change their German-sounding surname ‘Saxe-Coburg and Gotha’ to ‘Windsor’ and where the works of Beethoven and Bach were not played any more, it is hardly surprising that a German scientist was no longer popular.

Study participants have also found it nearly impossible to recall the critical locations of fire extinguishers,2 the order of characters on a computer keyboard,3 or the exact details of transportation signs.4 Do you perhaps know how many people are depicted on a standard pedestrian crosswalk sign? Our brain does not function as a memory machine designed to save details. Instead, it is equipped to forget every last little detail or, to put it another way, to sacrifice to the greater good for the bigger picture.

5. If I were to say: “Think about your grandmother!”—you wouldn’t get some kind of “grandmother neuron” suddenly popping up in your brain (as brain researchers used to believe)—instead your neuronal network would assume a very particular state. And it is precisely in this state, in the way in which the nerve cells activate each other, where the information is located. This may sound somewhat abstract, but let us simplify it by comparing it to a very, very large orchestra. Individual members of an orchestra can also individually change their activity level (playing louder or quieter or at higher or deeper tones). If you are watching a silent orchestra with inactive musicians, it’s impossible to know what compositions they have in their repertoire. In the same way, it’s impossible to know what a brain is able to think by simply observing it from outside of its neural network. In an orchestra, the music is produced when the musicians play together and in sync. The music is not located somewhere within the orchestra but is rather in the activity of the individual musicians. If you only listen to a single viola, you can gain some insight into one musician, but you won’t have any idea of what the complete musical piece sounds like. In order to know this, you also need to find out the way in which the other musicians are active at the same time. But even this would not be adequate because in this case you would only know what one particular tone sounds like at any one given moment in time, whereas the music only first emerges when you consider it over the course of time. The information (in this case, the melody of the musical work) is located between the various musicians. Like orchestra musicians, neurons also tune themselves to one another. Just as an orchestra produces a piece of music when the musicians interact, neurons produce the informational content of a thought. A thought isn’t stuck somewhere in the network of a brain. Instead, it is located in the manner in which the network interacts or plays together. In order for this to go off without a hitch, the neurons are connected to each other over common points of contact (synapses), which is the only way that the individual nerve cells can figure out what all the others are up to. In an orchestra, every musician listens to what the others are playing to ensure that they can keep in sync and in tune with each other. In the cerebrum, neurons are connected with several thousand other nerve cells, which means that they are able to produce much more complex states of activity than an orchestra. But it is precisely in these states of activity that the content of the brain’s information is located. In an orchestra, this is the music; in the brain, it is a thought.
   - Location: 350-369
   - Page: 23

6. This method for processing information has a couple of crucial benefits. Just as the same orchestra is able to play completely different pieces of music by synchronizing the playing of the individual musicians in a new way, the exact same neural network is able to produce totally unique thoughts merely by a shift in activation. In addition, a piece of information (whether a melody played in an orchestra or an image in one’s head) is not necessarily coded in a concrete state of activity, but also in the shift of the state. The mood of a piece of music may be influenced by whether the musicians play softer or louder—in the same way, the information in the neural state may also be influenced by the way in which the neurons shift their activity and not only how they currently are. This brings us to the realization that the number of possible patterns of activity is vast. The question of how many thoughts it’s possible to think is thus as useful as the question of how many songs it’s possible for an orchestra to play. There is something else to notice here. In a computer, the information is stored in a location. When you switch the machine off, the information is still there (saved in the form of electrical charges), and all you have to do is to turn the computer back on to retrieve it. But if you switch off a brain, the party is over. End of story. Because the information stored in a brain is not located in any particular physical location but is rather an ever-changing state of the network. During a person’s lifetime, a thought or a piece of informational content always proceeds from an earlier one—as though every state of thought becomes the start signal for the next thought. A thought is never derived from nothing.

7. When an orchestra practices a new piece, the musicians are in effect practicing their ability to play together. At the end of the day, the piece of music has also been “saved” in the orchestra’s newly acquired skill of playing it together. In order to retrieve it, the concrete dynamic of the musicians first must be activated, leading to the piece of music. Likewise, a piece of information in the brain is encoded in conjunction with the interaction between the neurons, and when the neurons “practice,” they also adjust their harmonization with each other, making it easier to trigger their interaction next time. In order for a neural network to learn, the neurons must also adjust their points of contact and thereby redesign the entire architecture of the network.

8. Don’t learn—understand! ANYONE WHO CAN learn something can also unlearn it. But once you have understood something, you cannot de-understand it. Learning is not particularly unique. Most animals and even computers can learn. But developing an understanding of the things in the world is the great art of the brain, which it is able to master precisely because it does not consume and draw correlations from data in the same way a robot would. A brain creates knowledge out of data, not correlations. These are two vastly different concepts, though they are often equated with each other in the modern, digitalized world. But whereas the amount of data from :-) and R%@ is the same, the information conveyed is completely different. Not to mention the concept behind it—a smiling face. To a computer, the characters :-) and :-( are only 33 percent different. But to us, they are 100 percent different.

10. When are we best able to learn? When we are excited about it, of course. Facts are not that important. It’s the feelings that stick with us. Best is if the feeling is positive. Positive feelings should thus be conveyed at school, university, or in work environments by the teachers, lecturers, or team leaders to promote the best learning. This is much more crucial than the factual content that is taught.

11. When a “deep learning” computer analyzes millions of images, it will, doubtless, be able to recognize that a chair is most likely an object with four legs, a flat surface, and a backrest. But for us, a chair is not so much an object with a particular shape as it is something to sit on. Once we have understood this, we suddenly see chairs everywhere and can even apply our knowledge to invent, develop, and design new chairs. For example, I recently had one of those bouncy yoga chairs at home. My little neighbor remarked, quite correctly: “A ball!” But when I went over and sat on it, he said: “Oh, chair!” Try teaching that to a computer.

12. Memory is dynamic because it can change quickly. Let me return one last time to the orchestra comparison from the last chapter. In the same way that a piece of music can be varied by how it is played by an orchestra, a piece of information in the brain can also be changed. In addition, an orchestra might have fewer or more musicians playing (or neurons, in the case of the brain), in which case the basic concept of the piece of music (the information) remains the same, but the sound would change. Our memory is a construct because we do not, strictly speaking, call up a single memory when we remember something. Instead, we recreate it new each time, the way that an orchestra plays the same piece of music again but always somewhat differently than before. Each concert—each recollection—is a unique experience. Once our neurons have stopped activating the corresponding memory, the specific memory is gone though it is still saved in our memory. In an orchestra, this memory would be like the ability of orchestral musicians to listen to each other, to play their instruments at precisely the right moment, and thereby be attuned together. In the brain, information is stored among the neural contact spots so that it can be triggered and recreated again in the future. A memory is thus the ability of the neural network to generate a state of activity (corresponding to a piece of information, a thought, or a memory).

13. Because the brain does not have any “criteria for truth,” it uses a trick in which it only classifies information as real if it activates a large portion of the brain. In other words, if something really did happen, it must have left large tracks of activity across the network. This is true in principle since authentic experiences trigger particularly intensive brain activity. If we merely imagine a photograph, the image processing areas of our brain are not as strongly active as they would be if we had the physical photo in our hands and were looking at it. The only problem is that these tracks of imagined memory activity are enlarged retrospectively until they artificially grow to be as big in our memory as real-life stories.

14. This phenomenon has been studied by showing test participants a series of different photographs from daily life situations.10 On the following day, the participants were reminded about the photos from the previous day by being told brief descriptions. What they didn’t realize, however, was that some of the descriptions were deceptive and falsely described the photos. Misled in this way, some of the participants formed false memories of the original photos and were no longer able to select the correct (original) images from a selection of photos. Some of the participants even claimed to have seen a manipulated version of an earlier photo. At this point, the level of brain activity triggered was very similar for true and false memories, with one decisive difference: the image processing area became more active with the correct memories (since the participants had, after all, really seen these photos). On the other hand, if a participant incorrectly recalled an image, the audio area of the brain was more active (because they mixed up the new deceptive information that they had been given verbally with their actual memory). In other words, if the total amount of activity covers enough area and is integrated into the brain, the memory is accepted as true, even if it is not.

15. If our brain were to always function with precision and perfect replicability, like a computer that is able to open up a saved photo with the same quality, we would never have the opportunity to use our memory for new thoughts. Astonishingly, the formation of false memories goes hand in hand with the formation of new ideas and problem solving.21 Test subjects were particularly spontaneous and intuitive in coming up with umbrella terms for groups of words if they had first been stimulated to create false memories. The ability to think associatively, to draw correlations, or invent them is only possible if we free ourselves from rigid forms of memory and recollection. Errant memories are a necessary by-product of the way in which we think—namely, that we are not so much fixated on data or details as on meaning and stories.

16. Neurobiology very clearly shows that those who try to control other people end up losing a lot in the process. First you lose their trust, and then you lose their ability to perform. Of course, it’s important to evaluate whether or how well someone has performed their job, but it’s best to save this until the end of the process. Trust your fellow humans up front and clearly convey to them that the goal is about the end product, not about their method of arriving at it.

17. In order to build resilience under stressful conditions, it is imperative for us to correct the misconception that our physical reaction is a bad thing. In psychology, this is called “reframing” a situation. When you explain to test subjects that sweaty palms and a pounding heart are a good thing for helping us to achieve our best possible performance, they perform better on cognitive tests than when you simply leave them alone with their stress.

18. So, what can you do to get over your stage fright or fear of public speaking? Anyone who harbors the fear of failing in front of an audience should try to visualize the pressure situation as intensively as possible before it takes place. Studies show that it helps to describe in detail the sequence of a speech or test scenario.9 You should then play out various possible scenarios in your mind in order to break down your fear of them. What could possibly happen? Choking under pressure is not a sign of weakness—but of humanness. The same traits that can lead to a mental blackout are also those which animate your speech: your emotions. It is much more interesting to listen to a passionate, though perhaps somewhat shaky speech, than a perfect, squeaky-clean address that might just as well have been delivered by an emotionless lecturing robot.

19. Time is an artificial construct, a crutch devised by humans in an attempt to organize the world. For the brain, measurable units of time don’t exist at all. So how is the brain supposed to handle such a fictitiously contrived arrangement of time, featuring years and seconds? It is not built to recognize minutes or hours, which don’t occur in nature. If we decided to divide our day into fourteen hours, with each hour made up of thirty-four minutes and each minute of eighty-three seconds, it would be all the same to the brain. It doesn’t matter in the least to the brain how we choose to artificially arrange our time. Our brain is always going to be bad at judging it.

20. Humans are particularly bad at planning future timelines. The most typical time-wasting mistake at work is what scientists call a “planning fallacy.”2 At least one of the reasons for this mistake can be attributed to the brain’s inability to measure time reliably. When facing a task, we more often than not estimate too little time for its completion.
   - Location: 1168-1171
   - Page: 77

21. Whenever we are supposed to imagine the end of a project, we orient ourselves based on our past experiences. We reflect on how long a similar task took us earlier and use this to chart out our predictions for the future. What we forget, however, is that our memory is completely muddled when it comes to time. Task timelines always appear much shorter in retrospect (especially if the work was monotonous). It’s hard to make solid forecasts based on our compressed memory of time.
   - Location: 1179-1182
   - Page: 77

22. Studies have shown that professionals are the worst at estimating the processes at which they are experts, even though they are able to describe the processes reproducibly and precisely. The more experienced one is, the more these experiences tend to shrink together in retrospect in one’s memory. Therefore, someone who is particularly good at knowing certain processes is, for the same reason, particularly bad at assessing the time it will take them to do familiar tasks.
   - Location: 1184-1188
   - Page: 78

23. IT’S TRUE. WE don’t have any sense of time—literally. Our sensory organs help us to record every other kind of external (and internal) stimulus. Of course, this doesn’t always happen without a hitch, as we know from countless acoustic and optical illusions, but it is at least possible in these cases for our brain to measure something real and concrete (a color, a tone, or a temperature). But no such sensory organ exists for time. Rather, our perception of time is configured artificially in retrospect. We experience a sequence of stimuli and then embed these within a temporal construct. In other words, we don’t measure time; we “fabricate” it afterwards to match up with our perception.
   - Location: 1193-1198
   - Page: 78

24. We learned at the beginning of this chapter that we often muddle our time planning for future actions since we can no longer correctly estimate how long these actions took us in the past. Routines, in particular, shrink in duration in our memories, always seeming to take a shorter amount of time than they actually did. The reason for this is that our brains do not measure time by minutes or seconds but rather by experiences. The experiences are organized into a chronological order on a kind of “experience timeline.” This is not a temporal but rather a “living” axis. The more experiences there are on it, and the more intense the experiences are, the more time we allocate to each experience. First comes the experience, then comes the memory of it, and only at the end do we get the temporal perception.
   - Location: 1278-1283
   - Page: 84

25. Because time is only organized in retrospect, our perception of time shifts during our lifetime. When we were younger our experiences were almost always new, or we were having them for the first time. In other words, we experienced far more memory-worthy things, and the density of experiences was much higher. But because our brain sorts and organizes these experiences only in retrospect, the time they took seems to expand in our memories. Later, when these same experiences occur more and more often, they are no longer new and are therefore omitted in our memories, which seems to thin out the density of our experiences. To put it another way, the saying “It seems like only yesterday” is nothing more than a disclosure of monotony in our own lives. But for someone who regularly tries out new experiences, the past will seem longer. We are hopefully able to recall our first kiss, which felt like it lasted an infinite amount of time in our memory. If you are someone who kisses frequently, you know that your memories of kisses seem to grow shorter and shorter. Perhaps your kisses really have measurably gone from minutes to seconds (ask your partner), but even if every kiss lasted an equal length of time, you would still emotionally recall your first kiss as the longest. As one ages, time does not pass more rapidly and, in the present moment, it does not seem to be racing by us. But when we look back on it, we perceive the illusion that our experiences are more and more compressed because most of them are no longer new experiences.

26. Fortunately, your brain deceives itself by ensuring that anything that is diverse, exciting, or simply makes you happy is remembered as something long lasting. So, you don’t really need more time in the present moment. You only need more intensity and variation and less automation and routine.

28. In summary, several studies show that boredom and a bad mood go hand in hand. When you are forced into an undesirable waiting situation, you are suddenly confronted by your own ruminations and problems that start bubbling up and waltzing back and forth in your mind. We are unable to turn our brains off, and this inability makes us unhappy since most of the thoughts that we have when daydreaming have a tendency to dampen our mood.
   - Location: 1459-1462
   - Page: 96

29. SO, OUR BRAINS switch to “daydream mode” not only in boring situations but also during almost 50 percent of all practical activities and are almost always in a worse mood afterward. Dwelling on our own thoughts is thus not necessarily a good thing. But the primary weakness of our brain is its inability to shut off our thoughts. This inability is responsible for our eventual ruminations and concentration errors. Boredom reinforces these tendencies, which is why it is seen as uncool and a stigma in our society.

30. It is only when you have a long-term decision to make or need to solve a problem in a new way that the power of daydreams can be usefully harnessed. If this is the case, first focus your attention intensively on the problem at hand for a short period of time before allowing your default mode network to switch on your daydream mode, thereafter returning with renewed concentration to your task.

31. So, what should you do if you can’t get your brain to switch off and are constantly plagued by unsolved problems running amok through your head? The answer is simple: deactivate your default mode network by engaging in a mentally demanding activity.

32. Especially creative people (artists, scientists, or designers) tend not to block out repetitive stimuli as much as less creative people. In other words, creative people have their brains organically adjusted not to get used to stimuli as quickly, to filter out less information, and to be more distracted.22 For a creative person, a new noise is not immediately marked as an intrusion but has the potential to be something inspiring. Many creative people therefore prefer to generate new ideas in environments that provide moderate distraction. For example, in a street café with a gentle stream of murmuring in the background, listening to subdued music, or undertaking mundane activities such as driving or going for walks. Interestingly, these kinds of activities, with moderate distraction, are particularly stimulating for fresh creativity. Not only were study participants especially good at coming up with original uses for everyday objects when they were surrounded by constant background noise (background noise from a cafeteria), but customers who were subjected to an inspiring sound (such as a steady stream of background conversations) also chose to buy more new, innovative products.23 The optimal creative volume is seventy decibels, which is the equivalent of a single, rather loud conversation.

   - Page: 121

33. People who are especially creative pay attention to the balance between concentration and distraction. They focus first on a problem, enter a zone of controlled distraction (for example, a street café), and then return again to a quieter place. This lets the brain optimally adjust its sensory filters, allowing, when needed, whatever is necessary to get through a task.

36. The question “What is 87 x 24?” is not answered by making a decision. Whereas the question “Should I get married?” certainly is. If I am calculating something that is completely objective, I am not in the process of decision-making, but rather I am solving a problem which any computer could also do much more masterfully than I. Just give a computer enough data and a reliable formula, and it will spit out a result. And if the problem gets complicated, it can appear as though a computer actually did make a decision (think about autopilot in airplanes or a lane guard system in a car). But this is not the case. In reality, the computer merely solved a complex computational problem. Making an autonomous decision, on the other hand, requires something more. An algorithm essentially chooses one option among many, according to a particular set of rules. For us humans, however, deciding is not about following a predetermined control scheme. Rather, we are able to piece together our own personal tools for decision-making out of many different rules, each and every time. The decision to get married is not the solution to a numerical puzzle because numerical rules are anything but unique.

37. In the future we may see completely independent, self-driving cars, but even these vehicles won’t be able to make decisions in the same way that humans do. Real decisions involve more than mere arithmetic and rule following. They are much more about the creative application, interpretation, and rebalancing of rules. They are subjective and never completely predictable. If they were, we would not be free. In other words: there’s no such thing as an objective, calculated decision. An image recognition software program may be able to “view” a photo and determine with 99 percent certainty that it is a face, but one should be careful before claiming “the software decided that it is a face.” Actually, what the software did was solve a numeric task.

38. If you provide a computer with enough data, it will calculate the most likely, the best, or the cheapest option from all of the various possibilities. But in each of these cases, it is already clear which criteria should be used to rate the final choice.

39. Merely the prospect of experiencing something novel stimulates our reward centers as strongly as if we are experiencing it.11 In other words: eagerly anticipating gifts is as pleasant for our brain as actually receiving the gift itself. That the most beautiful joy is anticipation has now been proven scientifically. Furthermore, curiosity drives us to take risks, and this behavior is even firmly anchored in our brain structure.

40. every later success that we have is based on a risky decision that we have made. The premise for this is deeply rooted in our brain, and it has to do with our search for better conditions. Not for the best conditions, because that will eventually get boring for us. Rather, what we want is something that is always a bit of an improvement. Becoming happy is always a little bit nicer than being happy. Our brain’s goal is not to be happy but to become happy.

41. SO HOW CAN we make the right decisions? Wrong question! For our brain, there are no “right” or “wrong” criteria when it comes to decisions. We cannot know beforehand how things are going to end up, and we usually don’t have any guarantee of reward or punishment. We don’t even know how we would define a successful decision. Only in retrospect does a decision seem to be more or less meaningful. And even then, we are not using a rational system to evaluate our decisions but are rather relying on our emotions as much as we did at the start of our decision-making process. We say things like: “I would never decide the same thing if I had to do it over again,” or “This decision was a good one for me.”
   - Location: 2391-2395
   - Page: 156

42. Every decision is basically more or less risky because it is processed in an uncertain environment. This is, fortunately, something for which our human brain is prepared. Our brain is not interested in being rational and factual about weighing all of the pros and cons and then objectively choosing the best option. Instead, it generates an emotional impulse that it subsequently backs up with supporting facts.

43. If you ask people who have just made an intuitive decision for their reasons, they invent all kinds of arguments to justify it. But these arguments can easily be pulled apart, destroying the original (intuitive) decision.

44. Researchers set up two different scenarios in a supermarket: one display table featuring six different fruit jams and another with twenty-four varieties. Over the course of several days, they observed how random shoppers reacted to the jams on display. The results should not come as a surprise: shoppers remained standing in front of the display table with lots of jams for a longer period of time but overall bought less. Of course, the display with abundant jam varieties was more attractive to the eye and lured passersby over, but in the end shoppers were simply too overwhelmed by the selection. Conversely, of those passing the display with only six jams, 30 percent purchased a jar, versus only 3 percent purchasing a jar from the table with twenty-four varieties.4 The jam experiment was very inspirational, both for science and the market. At the start of the 2000s, Procter & Gamble reduced their selection of hair shampoos from twenty-six to fifteen varieties and saw a 10 percent increase in turnover.5 Take away the burden of comparing alternative items and sales go up. This is a concept that discount grocery stores have already perfected. While a normal supermarket can easily stock 100,000 different products on its shelves, the discount store Aldi only offers around 1,300. Of these, there are only three varieties of muesli, instead of the average 118 in German supermarkets. As logical and plausible as it seems that we would be overwhelmed by too many options, it is actually quite difficult to replicate the phenomenon of choice overload. Eight years after the first study, a Swiss research group replicated the jam experiment—and failed to find the same results. Subsequent reviews showed that choice overload is not as clear as one might think.6 It turns out we are not always overwhelmed by a large selection, rather it depends on the surroundings in which we must make our choice.

48. Facts will help you to justify your decision to others, but only you will be able to justify it to yourself if you have an intuitive gut feeling. This is why people tend to be happier and to make better decisions when they don’t think too consciously about buying a car but instead let their intuition take the reins.

51. the more diverse these options are, the more energy it takes for us to compare them. At some point we get overwhelmed and simply throw up our hands. You can see this phenomenon when single people speed date. The more diverse the selection of potential life partners, the less chance that a single person will want to see any of them again.18 You can remedy this dilemma by creating categories.

53. We draw connections, come up with correlations and narratives, pigeonhole others and create stereotypes that are often not true. In short: we make decisions too hastily and rashly, and particularly without taking the time to think through our opinions and to perhaps prove them wrong. It seems much more important to be able to form a thought pattern that can consistently explain the world to us. And if the world doesn’t fit into the pattern, we make it fit by acknowledging only certain factors of our choosing. Such thought routines offer the enormous advantage of speeding up our thought processes. This is great when it comes to most daily situations because we don’t have to waste time or energy on surplus consideration. Instead, our brain can simplify and continue to refine its mental categories even further. Stereotypes help us to think ahead, not to think about. In this way, we are able to reach a judgment very quickly. But it’s important to be aware that these are prejudices because we are relying on our thought patterns and experiences and not on objective criteria. Such thinking can lead to serious wrongdoing.

After the judges ate their good meals, nearly two thirds of prisoner requests for day parole were granted.8

55. It isn’t the reward itself that really motivates us—rather it is the hope of receiving just a little bit more. Or if we have once before been positively surprised, we can hope to be surprised once again. But you’ll notice that this becomes more and more difficult to sustain, since it is quite a hard thing to orchestrate being surprised. It’s like trying to tickle yourself. Fortunately, our brains can do it relatively well. The trick is this: keep your expectations low. That’s the best road to happiness. Because if you don’t expect anything, you can’t be disappointed. Or to put it another way: someone who wants to do everything perfectly or always only wants the best will never be satisfied.

56. The important thing is the element of surprise. For example, when your partner suddenly and unexpectedly brings home a bouquet of flowers, a box of chocolates, or some kind of elegant piece of jewelry out of the blue, this has a much greater effect than if they had waited for an anniversary or birthday.

58. Demotivation system #1: Individual instead of group incentivizing Just as I experienced in my school class that special praise for one student demotivated other students, many businesses practice a similar tactic with their employees. Instead of encouraging the entire team, an individual employee is singled out. This destroys the team. The greater the difference in rewards for individual team members, the worse the performance of the team as a whole.

59. In order to study the lateral-thinking potential of our brain, researchers use tests that highlight the individual facets of our creative thinking. The process is not unlike an intelligence test that probes our mental abilities across various disciplines. While things like logic, memory, and language and math proficiency are important in an IQ test, other skills are also at play in these lateral-thinking tests. For example, the skill of divergent thinking. The brain’s ability to abandon well-trodden paths of thought or to jump out of mental boxes is unquestionably a very important characteristic of a creative brain. We have already seen (chapter 11—Biases) how our brain loves this kind of fixed thinking and routine. But these things won’t help on a Torrance Test, which measures how willing we are to abandon our mental comfort zones in order to come up with new possible applications for everyday objects. A Torrance Test could be something such as: coming up with as many possible uses for a toothbrush in three minutes! Alternatively, you could also substitute any other regular object to be repurposed, such as a piece of paper, a pillow, a plastic bag. The important thing is that the object must have a regular function from which the test taker will need to detach themselves during the test. At the end of the test, the creative ideas generated by the participant must be evaluated. Suggesting, for example, that a toothbrush can be used to clean a car’s tire rims is not particularly resourceful (and earns therefore only one point). But if someone uses a toothbrush as a paintbrush, going even a step further and painting a naturalistic picture of an apple tree in the neighbor’s garden, they earn three points. After three minutes, average creative participants earn around fifteen points. Theoretically, this could be achieved by either coming up with fifteen different possible applications for a toothbrush or five very divergent uses—complete with explanations of how each new function would be put to use. In each case, it is important to note that there is no right solution. There are only solutions that are more or less good. Which category the ideas fall into is judged subjectively at the end of the test. Because creativity is never right or wrong, rather it is constantly breaking with habits of thought. And this makes creativity the natural enemy of efficiency. Intelligence vs. creativity RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN administering the Torrance Test since 1966, constantly adjusting the test and environmental conditions so that the average score remains the same. The test is thus standardized in the same way that IQ tests are readjusted every few years in order to account for mental progress. The IQ test is structured so that an average delineation point is 100. Regardless of how many tasks are solved in the test, half of the test takers score above 100 and the other half below. Interestingly, it turns out that over time, we must correctly answer more and more questions on an IQ test in order to reach 100. In other words: our mental intelligence increases by three IQ points every ten years. If the test were not readjusted accordingly, a participant from 1960 with an IQ of 100 would score only an 85 today—even if they solved the exact same number of problems. This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect. This problem does not apply to the Torrance Test, however. This particular test has had to be readjusted five times since 1966—but instead of becoming more difficult, the test has been made simpler over time because the creative abilities of participants has decreased.1 This implies that while we are becoming more intelligent, we are, at the same time, becoming less and less creative.
   - Location: 3250-3278
   - Page: 212

60. Could it be that we are paying for our increased intelligence by becoming less and less creative? The more IQ tasks we are able to solve, the more our ideas seem to conform to norms. This is not at all surprising when you realize that intelligence means the quickest way to reach a previously known solution—and not the development of a completely new solution. Whereas in an IQ test you have to find correct answers as fast as possible, no IQ test calls for interesting open-ended questions.
   - Location: 3280-3284
   - Page: 214

61. Intelligence pairs up beautifully with our productivity-and efficiency-focused economy. Intelligent people solve problems quickly, in a straightforward manner and free of errors. Those who are intelligent are considered productive and mentally superior. This is good but, unfortunately, is also replaceable. Because if problems can be solved efficiently, they are too easy for us. The solution is already present in the intelligence test, and we just have to find it quickly.
   - Location: 3285-3288
   - Page: 215

62. Creativity, on the other hand, means thinking alternatively. And as much as everyone talks about wanting to be creative, innovative, and disruptive these days, the unbridled nature of creative thinking does not fit harmoniously into a business culture made up of metrics and spreadsheets that are meant to be controlled and optimized. Creativity does not mean doing everything correctly. Creative ideas are always somewhat “false,” erroneous, and uncommon because every new idea represents a break with a generally accepted way of thinking. Therefore, before you want to become more creative, keep in mind that those who think outside the box can rub people the wrong way; they question established work patterns and don’t merely accept them. They are not rule followers; they are rule breakers. They don’t tend to get along with authority, are constantly trying out new methods, and are thereby destroying a lot of things along the way. They ask tough, uncomfortable questions, often offend others, and don’t stick to fixed working hours. In brief: they are annoying.
   - Location: 3290-3297
   - Page: 215

63. creativity occurs through the fluctuation between focus and deviation. In general, our brain is constantly generating entire heaps of possible ideas, which it then has to filter out. You have already learned about both of the networks responsible for this task: the default mode network (from chapter 6 on daydreaming) and the control and decision-making network (from chapter 9). Good ideas thus come into being when the brain combines its ability to fall idle with its decision-making strengths.
   - Location: 3304-3308
   - Page: 216

64. It’s not enough to simply churn out a bunch of original thoughts (which the default mode network would be able to do on its own). New ideas must also be useful and applicable to solving a problem (which is managed by the control network).

## Superstition: A Very Short Introduction
**Author:** Stuart Vyse

### Highlights (34)

1. The origin of the concept is found in ancient Greece, at least as far back as the 4th century BCE, and for the next 2,000 years superstition stood in contrast to the religious practices recommended by the elites.
   - Location: 555-557
   - Page: 37

2. During the Shang Dynasty (c.1560–1050 BCE) and beyond, shamanic divination was conducted by members of the ruling family who were in touch with the spirits of the afterlife. The shaman would receive offerings of food and wine. Questions to be asked of spirits in the afterworld were carved into animal bones or turtle shells, which were heated until cracks appeared. Often the message was thought to have been carried by an animal spirit that rose to heaven to speak with ancestors and gods. The cracks in the heated object provided clues to what the future would bring and what action the supplicant should take.

3. The famous Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung (1875–1961) was fascinated with the I Ching because he believed the manipulation of the yarrow sticks opened a window into the user’s unconscious.

4. The archaic English word mage derives from the Old Persian word maguš, which is also the origin of the English word magic. In ancient Persia, mages were professional wise people who engaged in several forms of divination, including dream interpretation, astrology, augury (reading patterns in the flights of birds), and necromancy (communicating with or raising the dead).

5. Magic in ancient Egypt was well integrated into government and religion. Rather than being independent magicians or shamans, most ancient Egyptian magicians were members of the priesthood. Cultic temples to the gods were staffed by local priests who often engaged in magic. The magical texts that have survived from Egypt suggest that priest-magicians offered spells that often enlisted the help of the gods. One of the most notable of Egyptian practitioners was Prince Khaemwaset, the fourth son of Ramses II (1279–1213 BCE) and Queen Isetnofret. Khaemwaset was a famous priest and collector of magical items, including many powerful amulets. He also maintained a library of spell books.

6. Greek mythology and history is filled with prophets, oracles, and seers who possessed a variety of dazzling powers. In Sophocles’ tragedy Oedipus Rex, the blind prophet Tiresias reveals that Oedipus has murdered the former king of Thebes, a suggestion that Oedipus initially rejects, ridiculing Tiresias as a beggar-priest and a charlatan motivated only by money. Later Oedipus discovers that the blind prophet was right and that, furthermore, Laius, the former king of Thebes, was his father.

7. many of the binding curses in the ancient world employed a form of sympathetic magic identified by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer in his famous multivolume book The Golden Bough (1890). Frazer described two principles of sympathetic magic: similarity and contagion. Contagion was the belief that objects that were once in contact continue to have a lasting connection after separation. For example, some curses employ the victim’s blood, hair, or nail clippings in the construction of a poppet, doll, or effigy in an effort to employ contagious magic. Similarity is the idea that things that look similar have a connection. When binding curses employed figurines, they were designed to look like the target individual in an effort to capitalize on this principle.

8. The concept of superstition began as the Greek word deisidaimonia (δεισιδαιμνοία), which in the 4th century BCE had the positive meaning ‘scrupulous in religious matters’; but a century later it had acquired a more negative meaning, inching it closer to our modern understanding of superstition.
   - Location: 700-703

9. by the 1st century CE, a change in the meaning of superstitio started to take hold. The practice of superstition acquired an additional sense of being anti-Roman. The label superstitio was often applied to the religions of the peoples the Romans had conquered—particularly when the continued practice of these non-Roman religions was judged to be a threat.

10. Once it had acquired the pejorative meaning of alien religion, it was not long before the charge of superstition was levelled against the young sect of Christianity. For example, the Roman senator and historian Tacitus (c. 56–120 CE) described Christianity as a ‘recurrent superstition’ that was spreading from Judaea.

12. It appears that Christians did not immediately come to the attention of Romans. The Emperor Claudius expelled all the Jews from Rome in the middle of the 1st century CE for too aggressively proselytizing in the city, but there is some evidence that, at that time, Romans did not distinguish between Jews and followers of Christ.

13. In the last centuries of the first millennium CE, the attacks on magic and superstition in central Europe became much more aggressive. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the power of the Franks grew steadily until under Charlemagne (742–814) it encompassed modern-day Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and northern Italy. Charlemagne became king and, eventually, emperor, and during his rule, imperial and religious power were once again united in a particularly powerful combination.

14. Weather magic appears to have been a particular concern in the early 9th century. Around 820, Archbishop Agobard of Lyon described popular panics caused by the belief that crops had been destroyed by the magical production of hailstorms and other weather phenomena. These fears led to frequent lynchings of suspected weather magicians (tempestarii).

17. The Great Famine lingered for three growing seasons until the weather finally returned to normal in the summer of 1317, only to be followed by more cold and harsh weather. Hunger was so great that people slaughtered dairy animals, ate planting seed, and sent children away to fend for themselves. A common theory suggests that Hansel and Gretel, the famous fairy tale about two young children abandoned in the forest by their parents, was based on this common practice during the Great Famine. A very bright comet was visible in the sky through much of 1317 and 1318, and naturally this celestial event was seen as a sign of bad crops ahead.

18. The Byzantine Empire, the last vestige of the Roman Empire, fell in 1453 when the Ottomans conquered Constantinople.
   - Location: 1072-1073

19. One of the effects of the defeat was the dispersion of a number of ancient texts that had been held in the capital city. In particular, a Byzantine monk brought a group of texts of esoteric philosophy known as the Corpus Hermeticum to the Medici family in Florence. These texts were written in Greek and were attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (Thrice-great Hermes), and although they were Greek mystical texts from the 2nd or 3rd century, their original source was thought to be the much older wisdom of the Egyptian god Toth, whom the Greeks associated with the god Hermes. These Hermetic works were eventually translated into Latin by Marsilio Ficino (1433–99), a Florentine scholar supported by the patronage of the Medici family.

20. Although Christianity distinguished itself from pagan religions by a rejection of polytheism, it provided a serviceable substitute: saints. Indeed, in many cases the tombs of local saints became shrines that attracted a kind of cultic worship that was similar to the older Roman temples.

23. for the first time, the label began to take on its modern meaning of ‘bad science’. Both the supernatural powers of consecrated objects and the spells of the local magician were superstitious, not because they were dangerous or unauthorized forms of religion but because they did not make sense according to the new logic of science. In the Enlightenment view,

24. The secularization of superstition began to take hold in the Enlightenment and the years of rapid scientific progress that followed. With rare exceptions, the label ‘superstitious’ was now applied to unscientific beliefs that defied reason.

25. Today’s atheist writers tend not to use religion and superstition interchangeably. Of the ‘Four Horsemen’ of the new atheist movement—Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens—Harris has come the closest to calling religion a superstition.
   - Location: 1510-1512

26. A number of definitions of superstition have been offered, but the following has the benefit of simplicity. Inconsistent with science. Superstitions typically lack evidence to support their effectiveness, and, in addition, their presumed mechanism of action is inconsistent with our understanding of the physical world.
   - Location: 1532-1535
   - Page: 100

27. Instrumental or pragmatic. Some beliefs are non-scientific but have no practical implications for us. Many people believe in ghosts or in the possibility of extrasensory perception (ESP), but unless you are attempting to harness your ESP to play the stock market or win at the race track, your belief is merely paranormal, not superstitious. Superstitions are the subset of paranormal beliefs that are purported to have practical uses.
   - Location: 1538-1541
   - Page: 101

28. This can be an important distinction. For example, it is clear that the seances of the 19th and early 20th centuries were often a form of evening entertainment, but many people paid considerable sums of money in the hope of making contact with a dead friend or relative. Going to a seance or psychic for fun, much as one might attend a magic show, does not fit our definition of superstition. Going to a seance or psychic as a means of learning about future events or communicating with a dead loved one does.
   - Location: 1541-1545
   - Page: 101

29. Culturally fair. Because it is something of an epithet, it is important to impose some limits on the use of the term. If a culture has not yet adopted science as its standard, then what we consider magic or superstition is more accurately the local science or religion. Just as, in hindsight, it was illogical for the adherents of one religion to label similar beliefs in another religion superstitious, it is unfair to classify the beliefs of a pre-scientific culture as superstitious. Similarly, children often subscribe to a variety of magical beliefs, but until they are educated in the standards of evidence, we should avoid giving them pejorative labels. This definition provides a useful framework for the kinds of superstitions that inhabit our modern world, but in order to get a better grip on the subject, it helps to classify superstitions into topographical categories. Fortunately, the psychologist Gustav Jahoda established four types of superstitions that describe the territory well.

30. Superstitions forming part of a cosmology or world-view. Many basic religious beliefs are not amenable to scientific testing and are, by definition, taken on faith—or not. But other religious claims are about the natural world and, as a result, appropriate topics for science. When these claims fail the test, they should be considered superstitions. For example, if anyone still adheres to the belief that holy water or consecrated candle wax has special protective powers, these suggestions could easily be tested. Many people believe in faith healing, but the existing systematic evaluations do not support its effectiveness. Faith healing, though based in religion, should be considered a superstition. Finally, if we consider the deterministic framework of astrology to be a kind of cosmology, then it would fit into this category. If, like President Reagan, you use an astrologer to help you make decisions about what you should do, that is a superstition.

31. Other socially shared superstitions. This category includes the superstitions that we learn simply as a function of growing up within a culture, such as the fear of black cats or the number 13, as well as the belief that four-leaf clovers are lucky. Much of the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to a short catalogue of these superstitions.
   - Location: 1560-1562

32. Personal superstitions. Finally, many everyday superstitions are ones we discover through personal experience and adopt as our own. The model Heidi Klum is said to carry a bag of her own baby teeth with her at all times for luck, and the singer Taylor Swift, who was born on 13 December, considers the number lucky for her. She turned 13 on Friday the 13th; her Twitter handle is @taylorswift13; and she sometimes paints the number 13 on the back of her hand. Former Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs believed that eating chicken made him hit better, so he ate chicken before every game of his major league career. Because personal superstitions are unique to the individual, they get less attention than the more familiar socially shared superstitions, but they are very common.

33. 17. Similarly, the number seventeen is unlucky in Italy because the Roman numeral XVII can be rearranged to spell VIXI, which in Latin translates to ‘I have lived’, or alternatively, ‘My life is over’ or ‘I have died’.

34. People differ on a dimension researchers call locus of control. Some of us typically feel that we are the masters of our own fates. Others feel tossed around by the winds of life. The first condition describes someone with internal locus of control (in charge), and the second is someone with external locus of control (not in charge). Several studies have found that, on average, people with external locus of control are more likely to be superstitious than internals. External locus of control makes superstition an attractive way to gain control. In contrast, people with internal locus of control have less need for superstition.

## Teach Your Child How to Think
**Author:** de Bono, Edward

### Highlights (20)

1. Most theological definitions grant God perfect and complete knowledge. When knowledge is perfect and complete there is no need for thinking.
   - Location: 103-104
   - Page: 7

2. Unless we have complete information we need thinking in order to make the best use of the information we have. When our computers and information technology give us more and more information we also need thinking in order to avoid being overwhelmed and confused by all the information. When we are dealing with the future we need thinking because we can never have perfect information about the future.

3. The relationship between intelligence and thinking is like that between a car and the driver of that car. A powerful car may be driven badly. A less powerful car may be driven well. The power of the car is the potential of the car just as intelligence is the potential of the mind. The skill of the car driver determines how the power of the car is used. The skill of the thinker determines how intelligence is used.

4. Critical thinking has a high value in only two states of society. In a very stable society (as in the ancient Greek states and the Middle Ages) any new idea or intrusion that threatened change would need to be critically assessed. The second situation is when society is brimming with constructive and creative energy and critical thinking is needed to sort out the valuable from the spurious. Unfortunately neither of these two states is present today. There is a tremendous need for change and there is a remarkable lack of new ideas and creative energy.
   - Location: 190-194
   - Page: 13

5. The difficulty is that critical thinking is ‘reactive’. There has to be something to be ‘criticized’. But where is that something going to come from? The proposals and suggestions have to come from thinking that is constructive and creative and generative.
   - Location: 195-197
   - Page: 13

6. To solve such problems analysis is not sufficient. Yet all the problem-solvers in government and elsewhere are trained in analytical thinking. There are many problems which require ‘design’ as much as they require analysis. It is with design that we construct and create solutions. Design thinking allows us to put things together to achieve what we desire. It is not a matter of removing the cause of the problem but of constructing a solution.
   - Location: 260-263
   - Page: 17

7. Design is seen as something for architects, graphic artists and fashion designers. Yet design is a fundamental and very important part of thinking. Design is at least as important as analysis. Design includes all those aspects of thinking involved in putting things together to achieve an effect. Because the traditions of Western academic thinking have been concerned with reactive thinking, with analysis, with critical thinking, with argument and with scholarship, such fundamentally important aspects of thinking as design have been virtually neglected.
   - Location: 264-268
   - Page: 18

8. If we want to be more creative, then we have to develop some specific thinking techniques. These techniques form part of what I called ‘lateral thinking’
   - Location: 291-292
   - Page: 19

9. Bad logic makes for bad thinking. That is clear. So good logic makes for good thinking? Unfortunately, this does not follow at all. Every junior logician knows that logic can never be any better than the starting premises or perceptions. All logicians learn this – then many of them promptly forget it.
   - Location: 298-300
   - Page: 20

10. I would say that about 85 per cent of ordinary thinking is a matter of perception. Most of the faults in thinking are faults of perception (limited view etc.) and not faults in logic. Perception is the basis of wisdom. Logic is important in technical matters and especially in closed systems like mathematics. Because perception is so very important a part of thinking it is surprising that we persist in believing that logic is the basis of thinking. This arises from our reactive thinking habits. You put material with ready-made perceptions and information in front of students and then ask them to react. Clearly logic is important since the perceptions are provided. In real life we have to form our own perceptions. Both logic and perception are important in the sense that both the engine and the wheels of a car are important. If I were forced to choose between the two I would have to choose perception. This is because the bulk of ordinary thinking depends on perception. Also you can get quite far with skilful perception (as I shall explain later in the book), whereas skilled logic and poor perception can be dangerous.
   - Location: 304-312
   - Page: 20

11. Contrary to what many people believe, emotions, feelings and intuition play a central role in thinking. The purpose of thinking is to so arrange the world (in our minds) that we can apply emotion effectively. In the end it is emotion that makes the choices and decisions.
   - Location: 315-317
   - Page: 21

12. In addition to critical thinking we need thinking that is constructive and creative. In addition to argument we need exploration of the subject. In addition to analysis we need the skills of design. In addition to logic we need perception. Traditionally we have been concerned mainly with reactive thinking: reacting to what is put before you. But there is a whole other side of thinking. This other side of thinking (pro-active) involves getting out and doing things and making things happen. This requires ‘operacy’ or the skills of doing. It requires thinking that is constructive, creative and generative.
   - Location: 340-345
   - Page: 23

13. Creative thinking is very important. We can begin to see how we can use creative thinking deliberately instead of just waiting for inspiration. Emotions and feelings play a key part in thinking. It is not a matter of excluding them but of using them at the right moment.

14. FORMAL PRACTICE Suppose that you had never seen the game of tennis being played. You stand beside the tennis court and after fifteen minutes you feel that you have understood how the game works. Does this make you into a tennis player? It is the same with thinking. Almost everything in this book is easy to understand. You could read through it and understand each activity or method within about five minutes. This does not make you a better thinker. It is practice that makes you a better thinker. Not just any practice of thinking but deliberate practice in the use of a tool or method.
   - Location: 576-581
   - Page: 38

15. The time for the formal lesson should not be less than twenty minutes or more than forty-five minutes. Keep to the timing. These suggested timings are based on the model of one parent and one child.
   - Location: 585-587
   - Page: 39

16. Unless the motivation (on the part of the youngster, not the parent) is very high, I would suggest just one lesson a week. This could be increased to two lessons a week. If the family is on holiday, it might be possible to have one lesson a day – if the lesson is made enjoyable.
   - Location: 589-591
   - Page: 39

17. As a general rule no more than one new item should be covered in each session. In fact, I strongly advise that each item is spread over two sessions.
   - Location: 592-593
   - Page: 39

18. GROUPS I shall divide potential students of this book into three broad groups: YOUNG: Under nine years old MIDDLE: Nine years to fourteen years OLDER: Over fourteen years
   - Location: 692-695
   - Page: 46

19. YOUNG GROUP The ‘drawing method’ is very important and may be used with children as young as four or five years old. Although this method is described towards the end of this book it should be used at once. The parent should herself or himself read Part One of this book but not attempt to teach from it. Most of Part Two can be used directly. The model of the carpenter is a good basic model. Attitudes can be covered in a general way. The six-hats method can be used down to the age of about six years. At this young age a simplified form would be used. Treat the hats only in their individual use. Do not attempt to teach the ‘sequence’ use of the hats except with more able children. ‘Outcome and Conclusion’ can be taught in a simplified way but it is important. ‘Forward or Parallel’ can be taught in a very simplified way. ‘Logic and Perception’ can be omitted. All the attention-directing tools should be attempted: CAF, APC, OPV, C&S, PMI, AGO and FIP. Experience in schools (where there are many more children per teacher) has shown that these tools can be taught down to the age of six years. They are taught in a basic form with much practice and many examples given by the parent herself or himself. There may be some problems with C&S and AGO, since children are not very good at looking at consequences or objectives. The ‘Values’ section is important and should be included. The section on ‘Focus and Purpose’ can be omitted. Part Three should be much simplified. The section on ‘Broad and Detail’ is important but difficult to teach to younger children. It is enough to get the general idea across. The ‘Basic Thinking Operations’ can be covered without too much detail. There is no need to go through all the thinking operations under each type of basic operation. The exercises here are useful and can be fun. ‘Truth, Logic and Critical Thinking’ needs to be covered since it is so important a part of thinking, but this must be done in a very simplified manner. Confusion must be avoided. ‘Under What Circumstances?’ is not difficult to teach and should be mentioned. ‘Hypothesis, Speculation and Provocation’ is quite easy to teach to younger children because this is what they do most of the time. Keep it strong and simple and do not attempt to distinguish between hypothesis, speculation and provocation. The ‘Lateral Thinking’ background section can be omitted. The sections on ‘Provocation and Po’ and ‘Movement’ should be covered in a simplified manner with many examples and exercises. Children pick up these ideas from use but not from explanation. The ‘Random Word’ technique works very well with children of all ages. They enjoy finding new ideas using random words. This section can be treated thoroughly – in terms of exercises. Part Four of the book is not particularly suited to younger children. The TO/LOPOSO/GO method can be tried in a broad and general way. There are no complicated concepts here. In general the parent may have to go through the stages with the children each time. The drawing of boxes for the stages can be useful (‘Fill in each box’). From the rest of Part Four I would just pick out a very simplified version of ‘Arguments and Disagreements’. This would just be a matter of attempting to see what each party was thinking. The use of the attention-directing tools for ‘Minor Decisions and Choices’ (in that section) could also be tried.

20. SUMMARY So the model of the carpenter provides us with all the elements of thinking skill that I shall be describing in this book. ATTITUDES: The attitudes with which we approach thinking. PRINCIPLES: The guiding principles that make for good thinking. HABITS: The routines we seek to make automatic. BASIC OPERATIONS: The fundamental operations of thinking. TOOLS: The thinking tools we practise and use deliberately. STRUCTURES: Formats in which we hold things for convenience.

## Theatre of the Mind
**Author:** Jay Ingram

### Highlights (22)

1. the fact that our memories and some images are not as colourful as the experiences that gave rise to them helps the brain attend to things that are of immediate importance, but beyond that, if our memories were as vivid, as laden with qualia, as the real world, they would be indistinguishable from it, and that would make them hallucinations.
   - Location: 159-162
   - Page: 11

2. It’s also true that while you can talk to your passenger and drive unconsciously, you can’t do the reverse-talk unconsciously and pay attention to the driving-suggesting that language and consciousness are more closely linked than driving and consciousness.
   - Location: 305-306
   - Page: 20

3. studies of split-brain patients have shown that each of the two hemispheres has its own consciousness, its own set of ideas, its own actions based on those ideas.
   - Location: 504-505
   - Page: 33

4. it’s been argued that daydreaming and real dreaming have much more in common than we might think-that daydreaming only seems paler, less dramatic, more mundane, because it has to compete with an incoming stream of sensory information. Dreaming is immune to that input. However, there’s no direct evidence that daydreaming is dreaming while awake-it just resembles it.
   - Location: 557-559
   - Page: 37

5. There are likely 100 billion neurons in the brain, about as many neurons as there are trees in the Amazon rainforest. Impressive enough, but each of those neurons forms as many as ten thousand synapses with other neurons.
   - Location: 763-765
   - Page: 50

6. How many times have you run around the house looking for a set of keys or an important piece of paper, only to discover that it had been right on the table in front of you the entire time? In situations like that, I’ve discovered that the only efficient way to search for something is to prime my attention by visualizing the object, then search around in the real world for a match.
   - Location: 930-932
   - Page: 61

7. much of what is apprehended by our senses goes unnoticed. At least when it comes to being conscious of incoming information, the stream of consciousness is more like a rivulet, or even a trickle.
   - Location: 937-939
   - Page: 62

8. how little of what’s out there actually contributes to what’s in here, but one estimate is that one millionth of the information that bombards our senses actually makes it into consciousness. One millionth.
   - Location: 940-941
   - Page: 62

9. In surveying a variety of studies, Miller concluded that we are capable of handling about seven different tones, or seven solutions, or seven anything. He called it the “span of absolute judgment.” However, he pointed out, we have ways of overcoming this limitation, one of which is “chunking” the information.
   - Location: 957-959
   - Page: 63

10. Since Miller wrote his classic report in 1956, there has been much research on the matter* If anything. some psychologists today, based on forty years’ worth of research since Miller’s paper, are willing to lower that magic number to four, or, to paraphrase Miller, four plus or minus one.
   - Location: 965-968
   - Page: 63

11. one consciousness researcher, Bernard Baars, argues that the capacity for items in consciousness is not seven, not four, but one.5
   - Location: 978-980
   - Page: 64

12. behaviour—it’s just that we are not aware of most of the processing going on in our brains: it is largely unconscious. I am not talking here about Freud’s unconscious, which stored away unpleasant repressed ideas that only occasionally bubbled up into consciousness in some weirdly disguised form, nor about the collective unconscious that is supposed to be shared by all of us and through which one could trace human history. This unconscious refers simply to the workings of your brain of which you are unaware.

13. “One day you decide to visit the zoo. While there, you see a group of giraffes and ostriches. Altogether they have 30 eyes and 44 legs. How many animals are there?”8 The quickest way to a solution in this case is to realize that the number of legs isn’t relevant. If a bunch of two-eyed animals have a total of thirty eyes, there are fifteen animals, period.
   - Location: 1177-1180
   - Page: 77

14. seeing has as much to do with the brain as with the eyes—or more.
   - Location: 1332-1333
   - Page: 87

15. What these sometimes tragic cases illustrate is that vision is not simply a reflection of the world around us. It is more of a production than a reproduction, an act of creation based on images captured by the retina but not inclusive of all of them, and not limited by them.
   - Location: 1346-1348
   - Page: 88

16. Outside of a narrow cylinder of clarity directly in your line of vision (a cylinder that is probably only one or two degrees across, roughly the size of your thumbnail held at arm’s length), you have only the vaguest idea of what can be seen around you.
   - Location: 1357-1359
   - Page: 89

17. Change blindness is a nicer example of our visual lack of awareness in that you can be told that something has changed, and you can watch the scene change over and over and over and still not see what the change has been.
   - Location: 1439-1440
   - Page: 94

18. Those psychologists willing to take this the furthest argue that in our short-term memory we preserve almost nothing of the visual scene we just viewed and in which we were confident we saw everything. That would make vision a very grand illusion indeed. How can anyone get away with even suggesting something so radical, that we actually are taking in virtually nothing of the scene before us? They can because the data suggest it might be true, and they do have a fall-back position: it seems to us that we are aware of everything before us because we can look at it at a moment’s notice and reassure ourselves that everything is still there in its place.

19. The Necker cube, one of the most famous “ambiguous” figures. As you stare at it, it will appear to flip back and forth all on its own (from a cube pointing down and to the right to one pointing up and to the left). You experience the changes, but you don’t control them. The cool thing about the Necker cube is that it never changes, but your awareness of it does.
   - Location: 1509-1512
   - Page: 99

20. The problem with the Necker cube is that it’s likely that the brain areas responsible for the two different orientations are close together—too close together to be able to separate in an MRI. However, there is a different illusion, called Rubin’s vase, that might get around that problem. In your mind Rubin’s vase alternates between an image of two faces and a single vase. From the brain’s point of view, faces and objects like vases are analyzed in different places, places sufficiently far apart that brain imaging could distinguish them easily. Several studies of this illusion have shown that there are indeed changes in the principal locations of brain activity that happen exactly at the time a person experiences the flip-flop of the illusion, and also that the brain areas involved are widely separated.
   - Location: 1537-1542
   - Page: 101

21. If an actual wire-frame 3-D model of a Necker cube is painted with luminous paint, so that it glows in the dark, then held in a dark room, the image will still flip back and forth, even though the touch information doesn’t change. It is, according to those who’ve done it, a very weird experience.
   - Location: 1660-1662
   - Page: 109

22. Take the example of an intriguing illusion called the colour phi effect. It’s pretty simple. A green dot is flashed on a screen, then disappears, to be replaced almost immediately by a red spot that flashes just to its right. If the timing is right, what you think you’ve seen is not a green dot appearing then disappearing, followed by a red dot—you are sure that you’ve seen a green dot move from left to right, and change colour to red on its way. You can find a good presentation of the illusion on the Internet, at http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/faculty/phi/Phi_Color2.html*
